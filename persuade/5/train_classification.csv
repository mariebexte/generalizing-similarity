99504CB04F5D,"As technology has advanced, our methods of transportation have advanced with it. Driverless cars are things of the future, just as regular cars were a thing of the future in the 1900s. There will always be risks and certain safety regulations just as with regular cars but having the technology and not using it would be taking a step back.

The use of driverless cars may seem lazier or seem to have more risks than a manual car but is that not what people once thought about regular cars? Cars already start themselves and can be put in a self driving setting, so a full time driverless car would be a step in the right direction and be all around safer for citizens and drivers everywhere. Having technology run your car rather than a human, the risk and chance of a wreck would decrease dramatically. Although as of now a malfunction in the technology that could cause a crash and whether the manufacturer or the driver is to blame is a blurry topic the restriction of testing the cars would never give them the opportunity to fix the problems. Progress is slow as shown in 2013 when BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Asssistant,"" which can only function up to 25 mph which wouldn't be nearly enough to drive on actual roads yet but the progress is still there. The lack of states on board with the test driving of these cars is restricting the chances for improvement.

We, as humans, sometimes give up on things we see as impossible but things we think of as normal now seemed impossible 50 years ago. Driverless cars are simply an advancement that we're ready to make and improve but we limit ourselve sin our own abilities. It may be 20 years from now but eventually in the baby steps being taken drvierless cars will see the roads.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4AB746C12224,"Driverless cars would truly be an immense change in the daily lives of every driver in the world. A future where getting a license is no longer heard of and taking driving tests would just be a part of history would be the effect of these cars. Imagine how current parents and grandparents say how they grew up without televisions or cell phones, later on they will be saying how they had to drive their own car, and it will be mind blowing to everyone's future children.

My personal opionion on driverless cars is against them. I don't see how it is necessary for all cars to be re-done and have so much work put in to the idea of driverless cars, when we could just simply drive them ourselves. I don't see the importance of it. I believe to have a license and be capable of driving is a grand achievement. Every child looks forward to the day they can pass, first their permit test, and then later on, their driver's test. What happens when the driverless car stops working and is only able to drive with an actual driver? The skill of driving is very important, and it would be a shame to see that skill no longer necessary to learn in the future.

I can think of many more downfalls to the driverless car than positives. Not to mention, the amount of problems that can come about with these vehicles. If the car suddenly goes out of control or the car has to pull in a driveway? The driver will need to take over. I don't see a high possibility of these cars becoming available considering the innumerable amount of mishaps that happen when driving.

The article mentioned that automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved, but how can they be positive? Things can easily go wrong with this make, and to me, the effect isn't worth the risk. Car crashes are very harmful things mentally and physically to a human being and who's to say driverless cars will stop them?

In conclusion, i can't picture driverless cars being the official cars of the future. In order for them to have their full use, everyone would have to have a driverless car. Expenses, weariness of the model, and people who aren't willing to give their driving ability up wil be the ones to put a stop to driverless cars. I think some may own a driverless car, but there will never be a time when driverless cars are the only cars being used.   ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
69702102D072,"In the article "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both posistive and negative aspects of driverless cars, I for-one am all for the development 'smart cars'. I look forward to 'a time when no one buys cars becasue no one needs them anymore'. It is my belief that that the development of the smart car could help us a great deal in the forseen future. We are already on our way towards the idea of a driverless car not only becoming real but also helping our deteriating planet.

You see i believe that since even though there are a few vehicles now that don't necessarily need gas to run there are far more that do than not. Our vehicles now adays do alot of damage to our ecosystem than most of us realize or seem to care for. Sooner or later that invisible wall that shields us of the sun's light which burns brighter than any fire known by man will instead of helping create life, will destroy it. there is so much polution in the air now because of our nonexcistent will to protect that in which we live instead of slowly killing it. Now to clear any misinterpretation i must state that I am in no way a ""tree-hugger"", but i do believe that we must do something about this pollution instead of sitting back and watch the dreaded show of death. That is one of the reason why i am all fro the development of driverless cars, for I believe that this idea will bring us a few steps closer to vehicles that have no need of gas or any other polluting resources in our desposition.

This said i do believe driverless cars could also helpus in getting things faster. Already do most cars nowadays do cars have apps in stalled that allow us to not take our eyes of thwe road while at the same time do things that we feel we need time to do . Sadly it is a common thing these days for everyone to have some kind of bussy schedules since we are children. our kids now go to school for most of the day then get home and do their homework, go to school clubs or athletics they signed up for yet don't really want to do becasue their parents are the ones who dont want them out of the house all because they have to work late and won't be home 'till late or are so bussy doing other things that they can't take care of their children all day. So they send them of to be taken care of by someone else. This is the product of filled schedules which are made easier to handle now by smart cars. The technology installed in them making it possible to multitask while driving and able to not waste time making it easier to finish the list of things to be done.

Now most driving laws -as presented in the article- are written in the assumptionthat the only safe car has a human driver in control of it although in my opinion that is not the case in most ocassions. I believe that most car accidents are caused because of a drunk driver or because of a driver losing control. All these accidents could be avoided by a smart car; the way i see it is that in the future the way we are going with technology will lead us to safer car's where if in a difficult sittuation you could be guided by your smart car. Completely driverless cars could be on a kind of 'auto-pilot' in certain situations, for instance a person decided to go out with a couple of friends and decides that -although it is a completely irrational idea- to drive home of course with a simple click of a button we could all avoid a could be horrific accident.

F922B539FA61,"Did you know that automobile accidents are one of the most preventable causes of death per year? With thousands of people dying for small mistakes, there is need for some change. Surely there is a way to make the roads a safer and more secure environment. Google's driverless cars have driven half a million miles without any individual crashes. I believe driverless cars are the safest path for our future on the roads.

Unmanned automobiles have been on their way for a while. These developing autonomous vehicles are using some of the most advanced technologies to keep us away from harm. ""In the 1980s automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock wheels."" (Driverless Cars Are Coming) The necessary sensors have been in devolopment for over thirty years with improvements along the way such as preventing skids or rollovers. These sensors make the cars easier to operate. Google's modified Toyota Prius has a plethra of new sensors attached to it. Of those, it contains a position-estimating sensor, four radar sensors, a video camera, a GPS reciever, an inertial motion sensor, and a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to make a 3-D models of environments surrounding the car. With all of the upgrades made to this machine, it is a much safer vehicle than it was before and it exerts its dominance in having an untarnished history on the road.

The cars may be able to drive themselves but humans can still take control when necessary. If there is ever an environment where the car cannot navigate properly, like an accident or a work zone, the car will require the human driver to take over rather than taking its regular plotted course. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". (Driverless Cars Are Coming) The notifications for the driver to take control are maximizing the safety of the driver and passengers. Unexpected changes in the path the car has been traveling may require human assistance which shows the driver can still be in control.

In conclusion, I believe autonomous cars are the most secure way to travel the roads. They show superior technology and represent our capabilities to the make the roads a safer place. Driverless cars are the way of future transport safety.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
009DECF10E3C,"Driverless cars are defintiely something that not only will make lives much easier, but will also make traveling in a car much safer. The introduction of them is revolutionary, and soon, lawmakers will not have a case to ban them from being used. With these cars, human civilization will be changed forever, for the better. Driverless cars are the future of luxury and safety in automobiles.

First of all, the cars could make lives exponentially easier and more luxurious. With the task of having to drive themselves, people could take driving as a time to relax and think. As stated in the article, there could also be entertainment systems in the cars themselves such as televisions, gaming consoles, and computers. So long as the devices are ot operable anytime the car requires human input, there would be no safety issue involved, and may even serve as a safety feature, alerting drivers of possible imminent danger.

Next, safety in driving would be increased to a near accident-free point. With every car making safe, legal turns, following the government mandated speed limit, and using a GPS to ensure following a safe path, how could any accidents even occur? The only cause of an accident would be a malfunction in the vehicle, which is very rare in even today's cars. Human error would be almost completely eliminated, making today's cars seem like deathtraps compared to driverless ones.

In conclusion, these cars would bring a new level of safety and entertainment to people's lives, maing the highways cleaner and the driver's seat more enjoyable. With driverless cars just ahead in the future, human civilization will be drastically in day-to-day life for the better.          ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Because in that type of thing the driver is not in controle of what so ever the driver has no purpose to be there at all and it can be a very dangerous on there part because like instead of the person controling the car that is his life in his own hands

But say the car is in controle he/she will be putting there life in a computers chip they have to be 100% sure with that in order for it to be ok but i bet 50% of the people won't even care about there own life why you say.

because they will be to busy enjoying there new drivless car what if perhapes the car has a milefuntion on the passenger and it hits a person say kills that person what would you blame that on the person or the car the peron had nothing to do with it why because he/she was to depended on their new drive less car.

You also have to think about the legal lieablitiy with this new found car you have to have a sertain amount of mature level to drive a regular car but a drivless car thats crazy you can fall asleep at the wheel kill sombody and say it was not your fault you can blame it on the people that make these cars thats noun sence what would that .

Family think they will still press charges on you and the people that make because its they fault for the milefunction but yours fault fo not paying attention.

1F694DB4D678,"As years go by, technology advances. For example, everyone waits for the new Iphone to come out, or the next new gaming counsloe. It is a fact that technology will continue to become a more significant part of everyday life. Although, there are some ways that technology would not benefit people. Driverless cars are a prime example of technological advances going wrong.

Manufacturing driverless cars would only cause trouble for the future. First, driverless cars are too expensive to manufacture. In the article, the author explains how Radar alone costs two hundered million dollars. If just one part of the process of developing driverless cars costs millions of dollars, just imagine how much more it would cost to actually build them. Not only will the initial cost be in the millions, just think about repairs needed if an accident were to occur. The owner of the car would be in extreme debt by the time the tires are changed. In which case, driverless cars would just be an economical waste. Second, if an accident were to take place, the only people to blame would be the manufactuerers themselves. In pharagraph 9, the author explains how most self driving cars ""focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This lead to many states banning the use of self driving cars. Companies still believe that these states will make it legal to test these cars once the cars are proved more ""reliably safe."" The fact of the matter is, that just one screw out of place could cost a life.

As technology advances, there are more chances that something could go wrong. Yes, driverless cars would be a huge advacement in this technology filled world, but people need to recongize the potential damage that come with them. Self-driving cars would be the equivalent of drivng with a blindfold. There is no point in giving something so unnesscary out to families. So to prevent harm to anyone, drivers, passengers, and predestrians, it would be best to not manufacture driverless cars. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
0A5115A891BB,"I think the idea of driverless cars is a good idea at some points but it also can be dangerous because what if the cra messes up when its driving its self and you hit something and the person dies that was in the car who would be held responsible for that person loosing there lives over a silly mental mistake but i think its a good idea also because if you go on a trip and you feel like resting with outh pulling over to the side of the road you can just make your car drive for you.

But i really like the idea of what google did when it said that the seat vibrate when you are in danger or you are about to hit something. Or maybe when you have an important text all you have to do is let your car drive its self while you text whoever back i think it would stop mostly all the wrecks from texting and driving. Or another positive fact is what if you had a baby in the back seat and it was crying you can let your car drive while you stop the baby from crying or ETC.

Or if you were smoking or eating something your car would drive for you i think that would stop all the wrecks from people. But how does your car know where to go do you put a address or a destanation where you want to go.

Also another good idea is if you had an disabled human being that cant walk or drive then that would be good for them cause they dont got to worry how to get places or depend on a ride from somebody.

I like how some of these cars have sensors to alert the driver of something there about to hit or someone is about to hit them, another negative thing is what if a child gets in a car and they get the car starts to drive by there self and the child dies or something. And would this effect the age you have to get a liscence?

AED97F3F4621,"Robot cars or driverless cars should not be developed. The development of thes cars can lead to many negative influences. Such as lacking or lazieness, wrecks, a lot of money and could be hacked. Driverless cars to many people is a thumbs down.

There are many different things that the humans just phiscally need to do and driving is one of them. The development of cars that can get you from point a to point b is already good enough. Most teenagers and adults like the thought of them being able to drive phsically and mentally. It would get boring after awhile because you would just be sittting there the whole entire time not incontrol of anything. There has been way to many technology objects that has been created which has been proven to make the human generation lazy. Creating safer transportation is positive and should be the direction cars should be leading towards. Driverless car may sound a little cool, but could lead to many dangerous harm.

The dangers of a car driving itself isn't so safe. There could be many malfuntions that could create car crashes. Many malfuntions could happen such as not braking in time, string uncontrolably, elctrical explosions, or maye even if the car accelerates when it's not needed. Teenagers could sitting in one on the road texting and not paying attention while the vechile is heading towards a tree or a person. The danger zones of driving will rise even more. Technology with other minor things is already expensive, hard telling how much these cars would cost.

Cars already are very expensive to buy now, so what could make these cars easy to produce and sell?

The driverless cars would use half fuel today's taxis need. Which is going to make people save money. The driverless car would offer far more flexibility than a bus. The driverless cars could change the world in a positive way.

Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half million miles without crashing. People would be so curious about the cars that they would love to try them. People is getting to discover more and more technology which is fascinating stuff and a driverless car would be a surprise for them and they would like to know about it. A driverless car is something that television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves.

A driverless car could be a benefit for a lot of people. People been trying to make a driverless car since the 1950's. They couldn't developed because it was just too expensive. Now that the world have advance a lot in technology is the time to start making new stuff in the world. If a company would dare to do this is going to change the history of the world and it would be in history forever.

Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car Project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. There was no way that they could make a car like this before 2000 because they didn't have all the technology that we have today. The radar it was just too expensive.

The radar cost it was two hundred million dollars. If the companies now have all this technology around them why not make the driverless car.

EA505E0C28AF,"In modern society, cars are obviously popular. They are one of the most used means of transportation, and driving can be exciting for some people. Now because cars are so popular today, many wrecks occur consistently. Rather it be because of the person who was driving the car's fault, or another car accidently or purposely hitting the other car, this is why I am against driveless cars. So many wrecks happen already with an actual person driving the vehicle, imagine no one driving the car. The level of safety would not be exceeded, and would rise the statistics of deaths in cars.

First, an issue with driveless cars is not only do we need the technology to make the car driveless, we also have to change our surroundings. ""Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" The passage explains that some roads will need to be changed for driveless cars to work effectively. These ""smarter roads"" would need electricle cables to send signals to the car, magnets for alternating polarity and binary codes. Now no one is saying this can not be done because it has been accomplished before, but there will be an expensive price that comes with it. If these prices are not dealt with, no smarter roads and definitley no smarter cars.

Although today, driveless cars technically exist, they are not 100% reliable. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This places a lot of responsibility for the driver and those seated in the car. Due to the car not being completely driveless, one will have to pay attention to the road, accidents, and where they are heading. If the driver located in the car is not paying attention this can cause car wrecks and even death. To add more safety to the car, the manufactures have created signals. The signals let the driver know when there is danger ahead. But if the driver misses these signals, they are again at risk and their safety becomes their responsibility.

Another problem that arises with driveless cars is the relatonship between the manufacturers and the driver or those in the car. Accidents happen often, and if an accident were to happen it is hard to choose who would be at fault. Would it be the manufacturer who is supposed to create their inventions to perfection for an individuals safety? Or would it be the drivers fault because if something were to happen, they should be aware at all times? ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" It is very difficult to answer these questions, therefore safety regulations have been admitted in certain states including California, Nevada, Florida and the District of Columbia.

In conclusion, driveless cars have a long way to go before they can be considered safe. Deaths are skyrocketing as it is with humans driving cars and we certainly are not ready for a car to drive itself. Until we have the proper technology that will work at all costs, driveless cars are useless and better left untouched.         ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
224A934894A4,"Driverless cars may seem like a cool new innovation that take the stress away from driving. The truth is that while there are many positive things about driverless cars there are still many complications with introducing them into society. Without a driver, the mechanics could malfunction and cause a safetly threat to other drivers and pedestrians. Many states also have laws against even testing driverless cars. Even thought the car can do the basic driving by itself, the human passangers still need to take control for more complicated road conditions. The production and use of driverless cars is negative to society because they pose a safety threat, force laws to change, and they still require human control.

Saftey is always a concern when dealing with any type of motor vehicle and driverless cars increase the risk of safety because they do not have human control. Every state has road laws that every driver is meant to follow. Traffic laws assume that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence states how the laws believe that a car is only safe when there is a human controlling it. These laws are meant to promote safety and since they state a human needs to be in control for a vehicle to be safe, then driverless cars are not the best thing for safety. This is negative because when there is a larger safety risk, more people may be fatally injured and the general public will feel unsafe. the use of driverless cars on the road would require the laws to be modified and allow their use.

Another way that driverless cars are negative to society is that they would force the laws to change to accommadate them. All over the country there are laws in place that prohibit the use of driverless cars. According the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"". Since driveress cars are illegal in most states, in order for them to be used on the roads all of the laws relevant to this topic would need to be changed or adjusted. Changing the laws is negative because changing the already safe laws could cause the general public to be unsafe and the process for changing the laws is a hastle. It needs to be sent in and approved by many government branches and could be rejected by any one, causing the process to repeat. Not only is it a hastle and burden, it is also takes a lot of time. Even if the laws are changed the cars still require human involvement

Driverless cars may seem more convenient but in reality they require human interaction in any tough traffic situation. As a result this is negative because it is not improving the convenience for drivers. Some say that driverless cars are more convenient, but in fact they can only perform the easy aspects of driving without the aid from the human driver. Driverless cars ""can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires human skills""(""Driverless Cars Are Coming""). This evidence shows how involved humans have to be in a ""driverless"" car. An invention that seems convenient actually requires the driver to be more alert so they know when they need to step in to control the car in difficult situations. This is negative because waiting for difficult road conditions can cause a driver to be more stressed and anxious than they would be if they were normally driving a car. Since the driver needs to more alert and the fact that driverless cars are not that convenient at all there is no reason for them to be on the roads.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be produced and driven on the roads becasue they pose a saftely threat to the general public, they require the laws to change and they still need human interaction and therefore are not a convenience. Considering this, is it really worth all the risk and hastle just for something ""cool"" to be on the road? Would it still be cool if these vehicles endangered you or a family member?

2876A84EAEDA,"New ideas, and smart engineering has been making it possible and eaiser to do many thngs. With cuttuing edge technology and knowledge evolving, humans have been acheiving and setting for the unthinkable. From cars traveling faster than the speed of sound, to cars that can drive themselves. Some aren't to happy with the image of that. Think, can cars really drive on their own, and what if the cars crashes who's at fault?

The idea of self driving cars scare many that maybe why it's actually illegal to even test computer-driven cars, stated in passage 9. This is because it isn't a hundred percent safe, though Google has cars that have been driven for a million miles without a crash, stated in passage 2. I think it would make a big change if cars could drive themselves. There would probably still be car accidents, but there would be as many.

Self driving cars would have many pros because there could be less texting and driving, which means less accidents. There would also be less drunk drivers which mean leass accidents, and there could also be less people dying. This would be a deal breaker for parents they could actuallly monator where their kids go. There could be less accidents among teens and in general.

D7A9CF9A7786,"Technology in modern day is advancing in leaps and bounds, and one of the areas people are most interested in is transportation. People are constantly looking to make their commute faster, easier, and more fun. Safety is a main concern for many, and society is looking to create fatality-free roads. As such, driverless cars are the ultimate goal for our society. There are many pros and cons to such a thing, and the risks far outnumber the gain at least for the time being.

Many poeple argue that automated cars would be safer than a human driver. People are subject to risks such as distraction, drunk driving, and human error while machines are immune to such ailments. An automated car can safely navigate under certain conditions, and when a threat is apparent that the car cannot handle on its own, a human can take over. For several years, cars have been built with systems such as automatic brakes and other automated features that can assist the driver or fully take over the car. Traction control brakes sense when a car is sliding and stop it even if the person behind the wheel doesn't realize that they are in danger. With successful technology like this, people assume that making cars fully automatic would increase the safety. People would even get the chance to relax while in the car. Trips that formerly took a week or more could be made in days if the car could drive itself while the human driver slept. It would also be possible for people to do things such as work or watch television while in the car, things that previously would cause incredible danger.

While there are many benefits to fully automated cars, there are also risks that come with the technology. First of all, the technology does not even exist yet, and it is unclear when it will. For now, cars are only partially automated and fully automated cars would need a certain set of requirements to be met in order to function properly and safely. The amount of sensors needed to achieve full automation is astounding. It would take several different kinds of sensors including cameras, radar, and many more. Some of these need magnets or radio signals while on the road to function, so if an anomaly occured that put them out of commission, things could go terribly wrong. The cost of such things is incredibly high. The car in and of itself would cost much more than the same model without automation. Tax payers would be required to pay for installing magnets or other feedback technology on roads so the cars would have enough information to function properly, and people could fall into debt for the luxury of an automated car.

In the year 2016, automated cars are a dream that is far too dangerous and costly to pursue. Years in the future, it may be an innovation bringing safety and comfort to hudreds of people, but in the present it is impossible. The cost of installing the necessary technology for such cars to function would delve too far into taxpayers' pocketbooks to be truly profitable, and the technology would need replaced every few years anyway. If something were to malfunction in just one car, it could cause mass chaos and death or injury to potentially hundreds of people. At this point in time, the technology has too much risk to be possible in the near future.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
945F638F5411,"I don't think driverless cars are really that important. It's interesting, and would be cool but not important. I believe a lot of people would buy them. The purpose of driving is supposed to be exciting for you, instead they're driving for you. All together they're not important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting.

Driverless cars are not important, I believe that just driving regularly is better that the car doing it for you. There are still cars that people could drive just fine. I don't see why people would want their car to drive for them.

Driverless cars could cause accidents. I think if a careless teen would be driving it, they could think that car would be doing all the work. They would think that they don't need to focus. There are already problems with texting a driving, imagine if they thought they could text because the car is doing all the work. In the article it says that the car needs you to be alert at all times incase they come across work zones. I think that could cause accidents.

I believe that many people are careless drivers. People could get used to the idea of the car taking care of everything, in the article it says that the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Which could cause people to do things they could never do if they had to pay attention at all times. Someone could be paying attention to other things in the car instead of steering and cause an accident.

The thought of driverless cars is very interesting, I would be more accepting of them if I knew they were safe, and no one would get hurt. Someone who's been driving for a long time, I think would be more interested in it. New drivers who aren't used to driving would probably want to drive by themselves. I think the driverless car could be very useful to people who take trips that are far, and need to relax.

Overall, I think the driverless car isn't important, dangerous, could cause accidents, but could be interesting. I personally wouldn't want one, but others might be very interested. It could cause accidents to happen, especially if the driver is careless. It is an interesting invention though, the idea of having a car drive for you is cool. But I don't think it's worth the risk.    ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9541B26D4E73,"People are always interested in looking in the future. Now, driverless cars are becoming more interesting to people. Yes , they do have negative aspects, but they are a great idea. This will help deduct nearly half of the usage of fuel we use today, a bigger help on the public transportation buisness, and is a new fun way for drivng, so people will be interested in buying these cars.

Today, we use so much amout of fuel. This is bad because one day the supply will run out. These smart cars are a great way to help save fuel and save money. In the article it says, "" the cars he foresees would use half of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"". With a regular car you would continously pay for gas, but with the smart car, its great on gas.

With the help of these driverless cars, public transportation will be so much better. The article states, "" a future with a pulic transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system"". With the help of these transportation systems, people could save money by not having to buy a car or having to waiste money on gas. Also, they are more flexible than just riding the bus. It can take you directly where needed and back to where you came from. This would be a great help.

Though these cars are expensive to make, its a fun way to drive and safe. This means people will be interested in getting a car that drives its self. This is not only giving the buisness money so they can make more vehicles, but its making a drivers life a little more easier. It says "" we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way. some manufactueres hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays"" This allows the person to be entertained which will satisfy them with their car, but it will notify you when you need to take over the driving.

The smart car brings both benefits and negative aspects but there are many great ideas and things these cars may bring. They help with public transportion, the usage of fuel, and the car makes the people interested in buying it which helps bring money into the economy and buisnesess. These cars will ""fundamentally change the world"" as said in the article. It is a great idea and people are looking forward to better models of a self driving car.

F7F4D1EEFDC2,"Development of cars will improve our society and make everyday life much easier. People will be much happier and more free with cars that drive them everywhere without worrying about traffic. The advantage of having a car that will talk to you if anything goes wrong is beyond amazing. This break through will lower many accidents and safety always has to be first. The development of cars should be continued further because it will help people with disabilities to go through life easier, the frustrations of always being alert while driving could be made easier, and the technology developing more could lead to other break throughs.

A supporting idea is how people with disabilities alwasy have it harder than others when driving cars. It doesn't matter if your old or even deaf, anybody with a disability will tell you it is harder to drive under circumstances like these. In the deaf world, the deaf people believe that they can do anything a hearing person can do and that is true but in driving accidents happen all the time. Not being able to hear just makes it worse. If someone did not hear a car behind them honking because there is something coming towards the car or the traffic light is green and he hasn't noticed, many things can go wrong at that moment. Having a car that will alert you with flashing lights will be a much safer choice than leaving it to how alert a person is. Everyone is human and everyone makes mistakes but in the development of cars mistakes will be avoided. The mistakes that will be avoided can even save lives. Senior citizens will probably say that having a technology based car that would make it easier for them to get in and out of their car is what they have alwasy wanted. When a person is old and fragile they want to be treated with grace, cars that are more developed will hopefully give their hips a rest from the other cars that are hard to drive and sit in.

Another aspect that will go away with furthur developed cars is the frustrations of a driver always having to be alert. People will make mistakes in driving and with a car that will be watching a driver and ready to correct that mistake, it will make it much more safer for the driver and others that could be potentially hurt from someone's mistake. Accidents can happen in a second and if these futuristic cars can prevent all the deaths each year, then why not furthur develop cars. The developments will have drivers that are at ease. Not always having to be alert and jumpy at the wheel makes everyone happy. The way google uses their cars to have alerts will be perfect for any driver. The story talked about how flashing lights will be put into the cars and sounds to alert the driver of any mishaps. If the technology reaches to even more developments it will be great, for example the drivers will not even have to drive.

The third supporting idea will be how the development of cars could lead to more break throughs in anyway. The cure for cancer could just need a tweak and the develpoment of cars could push that nodge. Yes, cars are totally different than diseases but if one truley thinks about it human beings could begin to furthur develop their brains more in any aspect of technology. Leading forward will have scientists and manufacturers working together in furthur developing cures and even inventions that will help any person with a disability. The help that will be pushed from all this technology just makes the idea of developing these cars more. The technology that will be developed will inspire many things. The break throughs will come from more ideas once developed.

Many people will apose the idea of developing the technology of cars. People believe that people will become lazy but the truth is people are already lazy. Many people die from car accidents and most of the time it is because someone was lazy to focus on the road instead of the radio or forgot that they were drinking. Break throughs with cars will allow people to save lives and put safety fisrt. The development of car should not be stopped but continused because furthur developed cars will help people with disabilities, it will allow alerts to be made for the driver to always be on the watch, it will also lead to other break throughs down the line. Supporting the idea of developing cars should be voted for and people need to realize that change is good.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

It's probably going to be hard trying to win the govemernt approval because there is nothing wrong with the everyday cars be drive them selves. "" As a result in most states it is illegal even to test a computer-driven car I think it's a safety matter but also feel if the location was secrure it should be okay.

Wether that be saving peoples lives or saving gas money and helping out the economy in the long road developemnet of these cars is a neccessity. Also it will lower the amount of labor for using oil and help out with saving the worlds minerals.

Some of the reason why we should develop these cars in such way is to limit crashes in the united states and other countries and also it contributes to everyday people getting to work and home quicker and safer. Another reason we should develop cars are also to keep poeple safe and out of harms way even if they are a defensive driver, they still can't help if a drunk driver crashes into their car and kills them or someone else in the car with you. To add on the cars also make it to were every one is safe when in the future we will have so much technology humans will be safe from crashes. Even in todays world we cannot stop and say time out right before a crash is about to occur. WIth all the technology now it only helps prevent you the driver from stopping with warnings but what about the other driver or what if you ignore the warning and think it's something else.

There are a bunch of what if's in the technology field right now that only time will tell if some of these new car manufactures new equipment will work out in the cars. Such as vibrating seats used by GMC and aslo a vibrating wheel that is then nottifacted when a driver is falling asleep. Also other manufactures have been adding front and rear cameras for drivers to look at when backing out, also motion sensors that make sounds when an object is closing in on your car.

Too conclude my essay I would like to say that in the future I would like to see less oil used and futuristic cars made for safer transportation, and I would love to see fewer deaths than 100 in a year of car transportation deaths. That there would make news that the new future cars have really saved lives wether that be safer protection or transportation. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driveless cars tell you when an accidents is going to occur by interacting with a sensor. They deal with complicated traffic issues and pulling in and out of driveways by alerting the driver. I perosnally think this is a good way to advance todays world because there have been a a lot of people who have died in car accidents. The cars carry a majority of sensors which helps with detecting accidents and when the driver has to be put on the wheel and watch out for things and it will tell them. The information from the sensor can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power of engine. Having a car that makes sure you are safe is one of the most important things. Drivless cars may be an object that is hard to trust because you never know if it is going to work, but with investigating and finding out that the drivless cars have been tested and they are going to work can be beneficial for you. This would also be helpful because some people when they are driving are on their phones and not paying attention on the roads and then thats when the drivless cars would help you a lot. There are still cars being made and tetsed to try in the future which is a good thing for people all over that we will have these driveless cars. Also the law wouldn't put them out for people to have if it wasn't safe. The driving law focuses on keeping drivers safe, and lawnmakers know that saftey is best when the driver is alert.

Drivless cars will be beneficial for most people. The cars will tell you when something is safe. Having one of these cars can or may safe lives. Always having a break on some sort of long trip would be useful. These cars would be able to help a lot of people not only by telling them what they need to do, but by doing it for them. There are plenty of things these cars can do and it will be so good to people to have less car accidents. The goal is to be safe wherever you are traveling too.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BB6B3A9576D5,"My position on driverless cars is I think they are a good idea because it would make long road trips easier on the driver. I say that because if it notifies the driver when something is wrong or they need to take the wheel I think it would make less accidents happen. It has a sensor for when people need to reverse the car and makes noises or vibrates the seat if the car is to close to something. Also in 2013 when BMW annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", the car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. But the driver has to keep hold of the wheel so the driver would be alert at all the time if they need to take control.

If we have all this stuff on the car like the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" sensors for when the car is in reverse and it alerts the driver when they need to take over the accident rates would drop. People wouldnt be so careless when they drove too. Some people get tired of driving or they just want to be on their phone well when they have the driverless car all those probelms would disappear. They would just have to be alert when the car needs them to take the wheel. Driving may sound fun to new drivers but new drivers can be reckless and careless it would definantly drop the accident rates.

The only bad think about the driverless car would be if something failed than it would be the maufactures fault. It is their job to make sure to alert the driver to take over and make sure everything works. But automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved. They are expecting a car that can be on autopilot 90% of the time we just have to drive that last 10%. In 2020 three different cars are expected to be able to drive all by themselves.

One reason I am against the development of driverless cars is because theyare not safe. The cars can not be reliable at all times and the driver must always be alert. I think the car should be relibale and not need the driver to be alert. The driver could be waiting for a long time before it must take over, or it could all of a suden have a disfunction and need the driver to jump in right away. These cars are very hazardous and not sfae for anyone.

Another reason I am against the development of of driverless cars is because they take away are abilities. If we have driverless cars people will not drive. The cars will take over and we will forget how to drive and lose our abilities. Also, poeple will get more lazier because they do not have to drive, so they will not.

The last reason I am against the development of these cras is bacuse thay are expensive. Thses cars cost a lot to produce and take a lot of time. The cars must have sensors and cameras and many other functions to be known as eligible and those are very expensive items. Why waste money on these pointless cars, when we can just stick to the original amd safer cars with drivers.

Although there are positive apsects to having a car that drives itself there are also negative aspects to this car. The cars can drive themselves but are unable to drive through traffic jams or raod work . Therefore I am against cars that drive themselves.

Even though the cars are smart enough to drive themselves they are not smart enough to drive on non-smart roads. In the late 1950s GM ,General Motors created a car that could run on a speacial track but the track was enbedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to the car. Therefore all roads would have to require upgrades and this is something that is too expensive. The passage says that the cars can't drive through traffic jams,road contruction and when the vehicle is around danger . So if the driver is not paying attention to the car , the road and others around it then how can the car ,the car would be unable to save itself from crashing. With this being said I believe driverless cars are dangerous and would be way to expensive.

As i said there are benefits to this driverless car , while the car drives it self it provides enteratinment such as sound but when it is time for the driver to take over it turns everything off. This is a great idea because it creates less distraction for the driver.

Imagine driving a driverless car and it shuts down in the middle of traffic ,there is a person driving behind does not notice you are having car troubles and hits you. Whose fault is this accident ? Whose going to pay for the damage?

Well one if a person is going to buy one of those driverless would really have to think about it like do i really need it or what will happen while i have this car. A driverless is alright but what if the manufactures made it that the driver could still have control when ever they want. Without the car alerting them its time to take over whenever the driver gets tired of driving they would just hit a button and the will drive on its own.

What if the driver gets into a(n) accident? Who would pay for the damaged car because it wouldn't be right for the driver to pay. The manufactures were the ones who made the car. So, therefore they shoul have thought like if the car startsto not function right it is the vechiles fought not the driver. It wouldn't make sense for the driver to pay. The manufactures would really have to be the ones to apy for the damaged. If were the driver that had to pay they were the ones that wanted the car but on the other hand it's not the drivers fault for the carnot functioning right.

Why would anyone want to have a driverless car that still needs a driver. Wouldn't drivers get bored of just sitting there.

This type of problem would cause a lot of trouble. Should we be for or against ""driverless cars?""

A ""driverless car"" is only programmed to do the basic driving needs. For example, speed up, slow down, stop, go, turn, reverse, and more. ""Driverless cars"" don't have common sense. What if there is a cat that is crossing the road and the car dosen't sense it. The cat would just die, if a human was driving the car he/she would see it and stop immedietly. The car dosen't have that mentality. As said in the passage "" all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This proves that the ""driverless cars"" can't handle every situation and are at great risk of causing a accident. The passage said, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?""

What would happen if this ""driverless car"" got into a accident? As I metioned earlier, who is there to blame? The manufacturer or the owner of the car. Since the ""driverless cars"" can't drive in complex roads and need to notify the human to drive, what would happen if they aren't notified in time? It would cause a accident. This would start a argument between the owner of the car and the manufacturer. The owner of the car would want to sue the manufactuer for selling him/her a bad machine. Most of the people that purchased the ""driverless cars"" would want to blame the manufaturer even if it was their fault, just to get out of trouble.

Everyday machine like microwaves, televisons, phones, and refrigerators malfunctions all the time. They are machines they are not perfect and cannot last forever. They could crash at anytime. This ""driverless car"" is a machine, it can malfunction at any random time, just like any other machine. For example, if I had a ""driverless car"" and there was a stop light but the car didn't stop, what would happen? There would be another accident. You can't trust machines like you can trust an actual human being. A human being has control over the driving and knows exactly what to do, unlike a ""driverless car."" You can't even trust a ""driverless car"" to take you to your location. It might malfunction and get you lost. Then again, who is there to blame? The manufacturer or the owner of the vehicle?

I think that ""driverless cars"" are not good for humanity. They have their benefits but, not enough. It would come with too many accidents and problems. The manufacturer would get sued and the buyer would be furious. I am against these ""driverless cars.""

My first example is, you wouldn't have to necessarily get your license! The car drives it for you! I mean, yeah, you might want to know a little about how to drive them if something goes wrong, but none of us would have to go through the 6-9 months of ""Drivers ED"" that costs a million dollars. You should be able to take a class in high school or grab a book that tells you all about the vehicle, giving you all the information and knowledge you need. Wouldn't that be awesome?

Next, less accidents would occur. No, maybe not all because of some freak accident may happen sometime along the way, but less is better than what the rates are now. I mean, most deaths you hear about have something to do with car accidents. Just think about it, all those poeple that have lost a loved one in a car accident most likely would be on board with this. I'm sure they would never want someone else to go through what they went through. Also, old people wouldn't have to get their license revoked becuase they're too old! Everyone can drive!

Safetyness is a big issue when it comes to cars. Just think about all of the rules that we have today reguarding safety with cars. Driverless Cars could cause accidents and many new laws to be made just because of the safety issues. As stated in paragraph 7, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" By saying this, who knows if they ever will really have a completey Driverless Car. Without being completely driverless, something could go wrong at any time and that isn't a good or safe thing.

The expenses of cars today are outrageus, but think about the cost for a Driverless Car. The prices of a driverless car will cost the inventors and the buyers. The inventors have to pay billions of dollars to complete a car that functions all by itself, which is going to be very expensive. All of the parts and technology are already high in todays vehicles, so a Driverless Car is definitely going to be high in price. The money being put into Driverless Cars could be going into more important things.

A major problem that this car would have would be getting into accidents.

In the passage it talks about the accidents and says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"".

This is a very big problem because right now, no one knows who's fault it would be.

If the ""driver"" was sitting back and letting the car drive its self and its crashes into another car or an object, who's fault is it?

AA16C746C3DC,"What do you think about driverless cars? Are they safe? Well Google's driverless cars drive by themselves. But they're not truly driverless. The car still alerts the driver to take over the car when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. I believe that the cars may be dangerous in some cases.

First of all, the car has to alert the driver when the driver needs to take over the wheel and control the vehicle. Many futurists believed the key to developing the self- driving cars someday wasn't so much smart cars as smarter roads.

Secondly, the car may possibly be a good idea. There are many sensors all around the car. It has a sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. So the car is very aware of any dangers it may come in contact with. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Last, but not least, the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. None of the ""driverless cars"" actually developed as diverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all the cars are in fact designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. So therefore, the human driver has to remain alert and be ready to take over the car when the situation requires.

GM has already developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, other options under considersation are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. I also think that driverless cars would interpret driving in such a new way that it would make it both, fun and safe. Automakers have already started on making driverless models; Telsa has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz,Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive by themselves by 2020. The advancement on autonomous cars are already in the works, maybe we'll all own one sooner than we think.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9C6B4DBF759B,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it talks about the development of cars that can drive themselves. The article talks about hoe companies are working on cars who can completely drive on their own with no human assistance. I am against the development of these cars. I am against it because how can you have a car that needs no human assitance, I think it would be a safety issue, and laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe.

How can you have a car that needs no human assistance at all? Even the smart cars that we have today still need human assistance. Firstly, the cars tha we have today still have to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. The smart cars can't not navigate through traffic such as, work zones and accidents. Secondly, in the article it says, "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" I agree with that, who would? The whole point of having a driverless car is to not have to drive and manufacturers are no where clsoe to that kind of car. Lastly, the cars that we have developed now can only accelerate, steer, and brake themselves. The cars now have ways to notify the human when the road ahead requires human skills. The manufacturers are not close to developing a car that can drive itself because as of right now all of them stil need a lot of human assistance. They can't really do much by themselves.

I think that driverless cars would be a big safety issue. I do not think that a computer is as alret as a human. In the article it talks baout how driverless cars are a big safty concern. Firstly, what would happen if there was an accident and the computer was the one driving? Would it be thr drivers fault or the computers? Secondly, if something ever went wrong and there was an accident and someone was hurt who is at fault? is the driver or the manufacturer at fault? Lastly, what if the computer is controlling the car and it doesn't see something because it isn't as alert as a human? If the computer hit soemthing would the human's insurance cover it? This is why i think driverless cars would be a safety issue.

Laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. Firstly, in the article it says that lawmakers have agreed that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. This means that they think safety is achieved when human drivers are the ones driving and not a computer. Secondly, some states are already against driverless cars and no one has even onvented one yet. In California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia it is illegal to even test drive computer driven cars. Lastly, in the article it says that presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This means that the laws are based on human drivers are more alert and safer than a computer.

This shows why I am against the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars need human assistance, they are a safety issue, and laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers and pedestrians safe.  ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
AB1C30F7B3FA,"Imagine a point in time in the future where there could be driverless and flying cars. People have always for a long time thought that this could maybe never be possible. Google cofounder Sergey Brin begs to differ. He believes that their may be a start towards driverless cars.

Sergey Brin imagines a future where numerous amounts of driverless car could form a public-transport taxi system. He believes that this could one day become a reality. Driverless car production should still continue over the next several years. Although driverless cars have drove over 500 miles without crashing, there are still setbacks. Driverless car would still have to alert the driver while backing out of driveways and navigating themselves through road issues such at construction zones and accidents with other drivers. Driverless car so far can drive, turn, and brake, but there are still somethings that the driver would still have to do.

Although the production of driverless cars is still just underway, there is still much more to be done. In the future, driverless cars may be available to everyone someday. There is still a long way to go, but we are getting closer to achieving this everyday.       ",1,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless cars would be a good thing. It would be a big step in technology. Take some risks out of being on the road. It would also save some money. A car that drives itself would be a great achievement.

To begin, if the car drove itself then it wouldnt be as dangerous. When people are drunk they wouldnt wreck because of them being careless. The car can take over and have heads up display. Somthing not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. This makes that a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.

Secondly, The car can save gas money. With the car driving the proper speeds and everything the car wouldnt waste gas. Sergey Brin foresees that the cars would use half of the fuel in todays taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus would. The cars would be a good change for the world and the environment.

Finally, The cars would be a big jump in technology. It would be a big advancement. Radars used to be a big deal now anyone can get them. There are already some cars that can already drive themselves a little but there not ready for the streets. Tesla thinks in 2016 they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. Every day we get closer to having an automated car.

I think the automated cars would be good. The roads would be safer. Cost less money than spending gas all the time. It would be easier to drive the car. The car could be easier to learn.

103137A6BEE0,"Driverless cars are a good invention to have because they can prevent night crashes. Many car crashes occur when a person is tired or drunk. This car will take care of your driving if you're drunk or in a bad situation when you can't drive such as, being pregnant and alone.

First of all, let's say you are on a road trip with your family, its really late at night, your kids are asleep and you're really trying to stay awake. You remember you own a driverless car so you know you can sleep for a bit and if the car needs your assitance, you will be notified in some soart of way. For example, it will shake your seat, or even make a noice and alert you.

Driverless cars will help pregnant women when they have no one else with them and they're going into labor. Since pregnant women can't drive , especially if they are about to have a baby, it is a good help for them to have a driverless car. Mostly because they would not have to assit much on the driving part and they can just tell the car where to go if they have a GPS in them.

These type of cars can be a positive huge help in the future whenever you are drunk driving or pregnant. They will prevent crashes and keep pedestrians safe. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
1A5D1D1C4F14,"While humanity is doing just fine with how we use cars now,driverless cars are apart of our not too distant future. Personally,I'm neutral in this argument but if this new way of using our vehicles advances our humanity I'm all for it. People these days are reckless when it comes to driving and so maybe a car that does the driving will in a way stop all the accidents and reckless driving. Driverless cars could reduce hit and runs but drivers are still needed in certain situations. What's the point of driverless cars if there's still a need for a driver.

Driverless cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer better transportation than a bus. These cars could possibly change the world and advance technology. These driverless cars are helpful but need a lot of sensors,a GPS receiver,and laser beams to form a constant update of the 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Sensors are needed for these unique cars because they advance the car to mimic the skill of humans at the wheel and respond to the danger or something out of control. These sensors give the car info or a warning to cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine. The sensors give the special car better responses and more control than a human driver could manage alone.

These advanced cars are amazing but are exspensive and a bit of a risk. None of the cars are completely driverless. These cars can steer,accelerate,and brake,but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. So like navigating through work zones or around accidents. The driver must stay alert and ready to take over when the time comes. This is what I mean when I say what's the point of driverless cars if we're still basically driving the car. I do like how Gm has developed the driver's seat to vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into an object because of my personal experience with backing my first car into a fire hydrent.

To conclude,Manufacturers are considering adding cameras to most of the cars so the drivers are remaining focused ont eh road. While the driver watches the road,the car watches the driver. Humanity needs to experience new things and give this new way of driving a try. Driving laws focus more on safety. Traffic laws state that the only safe car there is has a human driver in control at all times. These driverless cars need to be proven safe and reliable. Humanity needs to consider that if an accident occurs who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer of the technology. The future is looking very bright,the best has yet to come.

CA4E45151A4A,"I am against driverless cars. Driverless cars do not seem very safe for a couple reasons. For years, we have been driving cars all on our own, and we have been just fine.

Driverless cars may seem new and exciting and it is, but they can also cause us harm. The driverless cars have tons of technology to it. It can help us break, notify us, drive us ,and it can take over the car. Which seems great but the quote, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"", is a huge issue. If the technology fails and we are injured, it can be our fault or the cars. No one will really know, and that can cause an issue. The person who is injured could sue the manufacturer, but it could not be done because no one really knows who's fault it was. It will be two times more likely to be in an accident if we had driverless cars, because we could cause our injury and a technology misfunction could cause it too. The technology would take over so much that we would just sit there. Some states even make computer driven cars illegal, and many states limit the use of semi-autonomous cars. They will need every state to make driverless cars legal and limitless in order to have driverless cars. Also, the driverless cars would cost too much money for everyone to have either.

It will be much safer to stick with us driving the cars, and not the driverless cars. Driverless cars can injure us and many others, and we have been doing just fine driving on our own. The driverless cars would cost way too much too. Also, every state will need to make driverless cars legal and limitless, if we developed driverless cars.

Even tho in the article it says there is an alert that lets the driver take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with comlicated traffic issues. I still wouldn't trust it, maybe you take advantage of it driving by its self. Then you start doing other things such as texting, playing games on your phone, or looking for something in the back seat. You really trust that car enough to stop paying attention to the road and others around you. So what if something does happen and you crash into something or get into a accident.

But the car never alerted you to take over, maybe the technology failed. So now you're injured from trusting a ""driverless car"". That you should of never trusted in the first place, especially with your life. There's no promises that this car isn't gonna mess up or make a mistake. So many things can go wrong with this car, because there is so much technology. Even if the technology doesn't fail, what if there is another driver that is driving reckless. Unfortuately you just so happen to be at the wrong place, at the wrong time. So you get hit by that driver, but will you get warned by the car that the car was even coming. In the article it didn't say anything about the car alerting you when another car is coming at you.

These cars can't stop everything from happening, it just might be the cause of something bad happening. The car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to alert the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. What if it doesn't notify you, not all technology is perfect. Almost anything can go wrong, they make you think that it's so perfect with no problems. But that's because they just tell you the positive things about the car and nothing about the negatives. Such as what could happen if the car does mess up or the technology does fail.

They're not gonna tell you things like that, because they want you to buy the car. Which you most likely will and you'll trust that car to drive by its self. I wouldn't trust this car one bit, because they're still working on it. So you know for a fact it has problems and could mess in any way, at any point of time. Never let techology take over something that you should be doing everyday. Also that car may not have the driving skills that you have. They say techology can do more than humans, well driving is definately a humans job.

Driving shouldn't be handled by technology, because its a everyday thing for humans. we know what to do and how to do it. Technology just could make a mistake and your like is in stake.

9085A50A73C1,"Driverless cars are currently in development that are able to navigate roads without the control of a human for a majority of the time. An innovation like this has the ability to change the world. Driverless cars would be able to form a public-transport system similar to taxis. Eventually, in the near future, a human driver would not be necessary. The development of these cars should continue because they use less fuel, they are in less accidents, and they help with the short attention span of a human.

Driverless cars should continue to be developed because they use less fuel than a taxi. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, foresees driverless cars using half the fuel of today's taxis. This would help the environment tremendously. In large cities such as New York city, taxis are a huge part of the public transit system. This many cars use a lot of fuel, and cutting that amount in half would be very beneficial to the environment.

Another reason driverless cars should continue to be developed is that they are in less accidents. Google has had cars that could, under spcific conditions, independently drive themselves. Google cars have driven over 500,000 miles without a crash. However, Google cars are not completely driverless, as they still need a human driver in some situations. Even though humans are needed for some manuvers, most of the driving would be done by the car, which can drive, on average, better than people. The cars are also able to sense and respond to dangerous situations, such as skids or rollovers. It would be able to apply brakes to the wheels that need it as well as reduce power from the engine. This results in a better response than a human driver could ever do on their own.

Driverless cars also help with the short attention spen of a human. People can be alert and aware on the road, but not all of the time. Humans can get tired, bored, and let their mind wander. With driverless cars, people would be allowed to let their mind drift, as long as they can be alerted when they need to take over the car. These cars would be able to do that with flashing lights, vibrating seats, annoucements, and other alerts. The car would do what it is able to, and when it needs a driver to take over, it simply lets the person know. The manufacturers are also considering using cameras that watch the driver to make sure they are paying attention.

In conclusion, the devolpment of these cars should continue because they use less fuel, which would be really good for the environent. It would especially help in the larger cities, where taxis are common and pollution is at high levels. They are also in less accidents, and they could prevent a lot of people from getting hurt as well as property from getting damaged. The short attention span of people is another problem that could be helped by driverless cars. People can not pay full attention to the road for long periods of time, but if driverless cars can drive for the majority of the time while only needing a person to take over occasionally, it would be a lot easier to drive long distances and it would be easier for the driver.

Self driving cars exist right now in fact google has had self driving cars scence 2009. Don't get the wrong idea however, the self driving cars have a ways to go before they hit the streets of America.

Cars that drive without the use of humans will have a much bigger impact than just not having to remotly drive it. A resurcher named Sergey Brin envisions a future with fleets of self driving cars transporting the public. Humans will no longer need to buy cars wich could save a lot of money for ordanary people who dont have alot of it. With less human driven cars Sergey foresees that the fuel used will be half of what is used today. That will have a huge impact on our environment and natural resources. Having to import less fuel means that America can spend that big chunk of money some were else.

The self driving cars of the future will be equiped with the latiest and greatiest technology. Todays cars already have radars that can stop your car from backing up into an object or even emergancy stop for you. Motion sensors can now beam lasers that form a constantly updating 3D model of the cars surroundings. A self driving car could use those 3D images to know when there is on coming trafic, See road blocks up ahead and even stop if a deer were to run out into the road.

Some people do not like the idea of a self driving car because it takes the controle out of there own hands. The Self driving cars that are currantly in use right now still give the driver controle over the vehicle. The cars even need some human help. The cars have been equiped to tell the driver to take over when human help is requred. Some cars will have a vibrating seat or flash light on the wind shield, or the car might even just tell you to take over.

Although this is a very neat idea, it is extremely expensive. This idea would work if all of America was urban land and not so many non urban areas. I think driverless cars are one of the biggest wastes of money we have came up with so far.

Driverless cars seems like a good idea and all but i dont think it is necissary. All it does is cost more and more money that does not need to be spent. We would have to buy sensors for all highways across the world which would be extremely expinsive. This is money we do not have and we dont need to spend money on this anyways.

Experts say that the will need roads that are embedded with electrical cables. We also thought of the idea of magnetic roads, but to have magnetic roads that make our cars work we would have to do massive upgrades to our highways. But this is too expensive, so we have to make the cars smarter rather than the roads. To do this we need tons of sensors, a rotating sensor on the roof, and a GPS reciever. All of these also costing a whole lot of money.

Making driverless cars is a bad idea in my opinion, but if experts are set on making them then they probably will. Driverless cars will cost us an enourmous amount of money. They will need to heavily modify highways, cover the cars in all sorts of sensors and cameras, and test them thousands of times to make sure they are safe.

In adition a car is an item some people hold very closely and injoy driving, these people will likely resist driverless cars, making for an uncomfertable mix of the two.

The driverless cars produced so far require humans to take over in siduations such as backing in and out of driveways, the visinity around ancidents, and unforseen complications. Right now these cars are only able to handle low speeds around 25 mph, and relly heavely on human intervention. Perhaps the greatest problem is the expence, the equitment is heavy expencive and likely requires constant revisions to the design as knew flaws are revealed, as well as constant repair. To add to that any accidents that do accore will can not be blamed on human error, so any manufactorer would have many additional expenses in court, not to mension how many laws must be changed in order to make any of this posible.

I think that driverless cars should continue to be developed because, they would make the world a more productive place, the cars are still in development and they would be cheaper in the long run.

First, I will talk about how they would make the world a more productive place. While we are driving we spend so much time paying attention to the road, but what if didn't have to? We would have that time to do other things, like maybe work on a new great project that could change the world. With driverless cars, taxi drivers wouldn't have a job. That means that they would have to find something else to do. They could become doctors and bring us back to health; They could become officers and protect us from the dangers in the world.

Next, I will talk about how they are still in development. I think that a lot of people are judging driverless cars by the way they are working now. We shouldn't give up on them so soon; Scientific discoveries happen all the time. Someone will find something that completely changes driverless cars for the better. Besides, they already show so much promise. In test drives, these cars could survive more than half a million miles without a crash. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by 2020. Let's wait until then to judge driverless cars.

Lastly, I will talk about how they are cheaper. The driverless cars that Google cofounder Sergey Brin foresees would use half the fuel we use today. Fossil fuels are becoming an issue, but what if we had one less use for them? Without the need for so much fuel that wouldn't be so much of an issue anymore, and we would have more time to plan for whenever the time may be that we run out of fossil fuels. Also, if we perfected the driverless car there will be a lot less crashes. Without so many crashes we wouldn't be paying for repairs as often. We also wouldn't pay for the medical bills and such associated with an automobile accident.

""Radar was a device ona hilltop that cost 200 million dollars (paragraph 6, line 7-8)"". So no mater what the cars are not worth that much. It simply is going to cost more to fix one of these cars than it is to a regular car.

When more and more technology is put into a car, more problems can arise. With so many working parts crammed into one car, there is a higher chance for the car to overheat. This can lead to an engine fire which can envelop the car in flames and endander both the driver and passengers, as well as the persons who come to rescue the victims.

When driving, safety should be the top concern for anyone. Not just for them, but for the safety of the passengers as well as other drivers. With this new tecnology, parents of young children could let their child opperate the car without the child having their licence. Driving on any road is no position for a young child to be in. Children do not have the experience to opperate a car properly. With this new technology, some parents may think that it is safe to let their child opperate the car when they are actually putting everyone in the car at a higher risk of injury and possible death.

In conclusion, while driverless cars may be an idea not far around the corner, this new technology could arise some problems. Texting and driving cases would dramatically increase with the new technology. Also, all of the technology put into the car could cause the car to overheat. Finally, parents may think it is fine to let their young child opperate the car on roadways. When really they are putting the people in the car at a greater risk of injury.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
C01DA70E6A22,"I think that driverless cars are a good thing but you have to remember that they are really""driverless people still have to be in the car and be ready at anytime. In the text it states that in 2009 Google made cars that could drive independenly under specific conditons. It also states that antilock brakes and driver asssistance still seems a long way from the dream of calling a driverless cab to take ""us"" wherever we desire. This shows that driverless cars can be a good thing.

In the text it states that in 2009 Google made cars that could drive independely under specific conditions. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but Google cars aren't truly driverless; but they still alert drivers to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with the omplicated traffic issues such as roadwork and car acidents. Google is't the firts ones to come up with this kind of thing. In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special track, the track was embeddded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever on the front end of the car.

It also states that antilock brakes and driver asssistance still seems a long way from the dream of calling a driverless cab to take ""us"" wherever we desire. Sebastin Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to cath up to the dream. Before 2000 there was no wat to make something interesting, the sensors werent there, thecomputers weren't there and the mapping wasn't there. In 2013,BMW annoced the development of the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car could handle driving functions at a speed up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.

This shows that driverless cars can be a good thing. I think that its a good thing because it allows drivers to send a text while the car is driving itself and as soon as they send the text they can watch the road for any accidents or roadwork and then take over until they have passed. Telsa has projected that in 2016 a release for a car capable of drivng on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Also Mercedes-Benz,Audi,and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselces by 2020. This is why i think that driverless cars are a good thing. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
5F58F22A24B5,"I think that the driverless cars should happen, they should pass a law to drive them on the streets. With of these smart phones, smart tv's, why shouldn't we have smarts driveless cars. These driveless cars can help us from causing more accidents, can help run traffic more smoothly. So what if the smart cars might need in active humans here or there, that is why we took driving test. If people don't want to do anything with the driveless car then they can go to the cars that you can drive.

In the 1980's, automarkes created the antilock brakes. Within 10 years they advances the brakes to detect and respond to any type of danger. Any more improvements can make driving safer even that the cars drive any tasks on their own. The Google cars werr driven more than half a million miles without crashing.

In 2013, BMW had announced that they developed the "" Traffic Jam Assistant."" They said that the cars are not developed enough to completely drive themsleves. The cars can steer, accelerate and brake by their self but if the can requires any human skills the car will notify the driver. GM made the driver's seat to vibrate when the car is near danger. Google's car will announce when the driver will be taking over. With all these heads up, there shouldn't be any accidents.

These driveless cars should not only be allowed to test in the State of California, Nevada, Florida, or even in the District of Columbia. The traffic law is saying that the only safe car allowed on the streets are in control human drivers. they are saying that the driveless cars might cause accidents becuase of a technology fail, humans can also cause acccidents. These cars were made to drive themsleve and to not make any accidents. Now if the car warns the human drive to take over and then they don't, and leads into an accident then that will be on the human drivers fault. The only way it should be the Manufacturer""s fault is if the car never gave a warning or if it had a technology fail.

These driveless cars should be going out on the market and allowed to be driven on. The automarkes are countinuing to work on the driveless cars to show the law and people that the driveless cars are safe to drive and safe to drive with. I still think that these cars are good enough to not cause any accidents and to drive as smooth than a control humsn driver. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
DE1F754CF5BF,"Driverless cars sounds like a good idea, but if you really think about it, is it really? A car that can drive itself could come with many other problems. Personaly I don't think its that good of an idea. In the following paragraphs I will be explaining why I am not for driverless cars.

Basically driverless cars are controlled automatically by like a computer. Think about all the times you've had an issue with things messing up with your computer or cellphone. If smartphones have technical problems some times, what makes you think a smartcar won't? Imagine driving on a busy street or a highway and something going wrong with the car and you not being able to control it. Someone could end up seriously hurt, or dead.

In the article it says how the car would still need the drivers assistance in situations such as navigating through work zones or around accidents. I feel like because this car is designed to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves the driver would be less aware while on the road and if for any reason needed to take charge of the wheel they wouldn't do it fast enough because they are not being as focused on the road as they would be with a normal car you drive yourself.

Also, if these cars were to start being more used there would have to be more laws made in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. They would have to see who would be held responsible, the driver or the manufacturer and that just makes everything more difficult. There would have to be a lot of work put into these cars being able to be used.

I don't think technology is advanced enough for a driverless car to be completely safe. Cars controlled by a person aren't even completely safe, a car controlled by a computer definitely isn't. The technology could fail and people could end up severly hurt. There could be many problems for the drivers and manufactures of these cars. Maybe one day in the future there could be driverless cars but I don't think right now is the time.                                ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E8BD7EFFE113,"I think driverless cars are dangerous. Driverless cars are not on the rode today because there is not enough information about the cars, to know if their are safe or not. Driverless cars are cool to imagine about,but their are things that should be thought about before putting driverless cars into society. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25mph,and the car has special touch sensors to make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. The Driverless car that BMW is presenting sounds cool,but it is not safe. The car isnt all the way driveless, and someone has to hold the cars steering wheel . What if the person in the driver seat falls asleep while the car is driving itself, and the car tries to alert the person to drive, because there is a work zone, or an accident coming up, and the person in the driver seat doesn't wake up. That could be a serious accident. Driverless Cars are fasinating to people because some people may like the idea of "" Not holding the cars steering wheel."" Plus, you dont have to worry about turning the car at a street corner, or hitting the breaks , but people need to realize that some things that you might find fasinating, can sometimes be things that are not as great as they seem.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
67BC1B7863C7,"In ths artile ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they talk about how cars can drive on their own. Although, it talks about how the driver still has to stay catious. If drivers still have to be catious and take control when theres road construction and what not, then what's the point in having a drivless car. To me it's just having like to drive yourself just without pushing the brake or gas. You still have to keep your hands on the wheel.

I just dont feel that drivless cars are safe. I'd rather have to drive my own car then to have the car doing all the work because then again it says in the article that you still have to be aware of where your going and if there is any road construction, also you have to have your hands on the steering wheel just for it to activate the sensors. My question is, lets say I live in a place where there is bad weather, of course the huge trucks are going to come clean the snow, but sometimes pot holes form into the street. So do the driveless cars go aorund them or do we have to be catious too, and even if the car does go around the pot holes, how does it know not to hit the car next to them, or to go on the grass, or even the side walk.

Some people get motion sickness when they are in a car. As an example, someone I know gets motion sickness if they sit in the passanger seat of the car, but are fine if they are driving and handling the car. What if a person gets sick everytime they go into the driveless car because technically they aren't driving it. In the articale it stated ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel"", in concern, what if a driver lost an arm and isn't capable of holding both hands on the steering wheel for the sensors and is used to driving with one hand.

All these concerns have to be thought while processing these cars. Drivless cars to me just aren't the new thing and a lot of more accidents are going to happen. Not a lot people read the manuals, they just buy the car and drive it. How are they going to know they have to navigate through work zones or around accidents? Why would there be accidents if we relied on a driveless car to take care of our driving for us?

614D5160B5B0,"Driverless cars can be seen as an advantage or a shipwreck waiting to happen. Yes, humans have dreamed of this technology for generations, but is it truly what we need? Honestly, driverless cars could potentially cause more harm than good. They even sound scary: if a person, not in their right mind, can't drive a car functioanlly, then why can a computer? A super being that can't even think for themself? I am against the developement of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States.

As explained in the article, two seperate companies already came up with patents for driverless vehicles. They used electrical cables/ magnents within the road to create a path that the automobile could follow. As said in paragraph three, these ideas worked surprisingly well, yet they were too expensive to be practical. This idea was invented decades ago; everything was cheaper back then. Now a days, this idea also seems inpractical. the cost for these ""smart cars"" will remain insanely costly. the manufacturors will be out money because the people won't be able to afford these high priced gadgets.

I, for one, love car rides when I can't sleep at night. They help me drift off into sleep so easily and in a such a fast manor. Hundreds of people across the globe fall asleep at the wheel of an aoutmobile every week. Even with all the distractions of driving, they can't resist falling alseep. So imagine, having no distractions at all, how easy it would be to doze into that comfortable state of mind. In the article it states that drivers are occasionally needed when the car is faced with a difficult task. If driver drifted off to sleep, a wreck is bound to happen. I also feel as though too many people will put too much faith into their vehicle that they'll become unaware and uncareful about what's going on in particular scenarios that they are needed in, and they'll find themselves in a fateal accident.

What good if a car in a round country trip if it's illegal to drive in certain states? What are people supposed to do if they cross the boarder into a state that disapproves of these new and ""improved"" vehicles? Just turn around and take another route? It's pointless to have a vehicle you can't take everywhere with you. Laws aren't just made for no reason; they're there to keep the community safe. If it's supposedly dangerous to ride in an un-manned vehicle, then why do it? In paragraph nine, it states that presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. I believe in this law wholey and completely.

In my opinion, driverless cars are unsafe. There are many statistics and facts stating that safety is a huge risk with these vehicles and it's very true. A computer cannot possibly predict how a human mind will act or what a person will do unconciously; these vehicles won't be able to have last minute reactions.

I am against the developement of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they do require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States.

EC1A2A36476B,"What I think about driveless cars is that it could be benifitual to the everyday workaholic but not the someone who doesnt plan their day. There are positive things to having driveless cars and their are negitives things too.

Some advantages to having driveless cars would be it would be less car accidents. That would reduct death by car accidents. Another thing would he would give you time in the vehicle to do the things you need to get done before you reach the destantion your going to, such as if your going to a meeting and you have a powerpoint to finish. They also would make roadtrips or long drives more safe because human errors would be gone if the human isn't driving. As the passage says the driveless taxi system would use less fuel and more flexable than taking a bus route. For bigger cities this would be a great way to keep emmissions down and keep this air cleaner.

However, their are some negitive things too. Like would the driveless car have the sensor capability to slow down when on a bumpy road or driving in the direction of a large pothole. Then you would have to worry about a blow out or damage to the driveless vehicle's wheels. You would have to think about repair costs of the vehicle's wheel if it has a bunch of sensors too. I would think that the driveless vehicle would have trouble in a rural area or on farmland where there aren't streets, just dirt roads. I would also think what would the vehicle do in the event of a crash on a freeway? would it stop and shut down in the middle of the roadway, or would it need the human to take control during the accident? Also what if the vehicle was in the path of an emergency vehicle? Would the driveless car be aware? The idea of something going wrong is too great of a chance.

With all the innovative ideas about driveless vehicles on the roadway, Im unsure if its a good idea or a bad one, but I do think it would be something to use for a big city and see how it would work out. It is a cool futuristic idea but are we effecient enough to trust vehicles to drive themselfs safer than a human? Im not sure but, its a good idea to try. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
40622EF40134,"In our current day and age we are making monumental discoveries and breakthroughs in technology and medicine. Mankind has risen above any previous prowess it has ever seen. In addition to the dumbfounding advances in technology already made, we have many more waiting just aruond the corner. Among these new discoveries is the autonomous car. However their seem to be many problems that could arrise with these driverless cars such as potential malfunctions in technology, legal liability difficulties in case of a crash, and the fact that they might turn on us.

While the idea of driverless cars may seem far off it is actually much closer than most would pressume, with Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan all planning to relearse autonomous cars by 2020 as seen in paragraph ten of the source document. However, one of the obsticles of the driverless car is the potential for the technology to malfunction. ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over"", if the technology formerly mentioned were to malfunction the potential injury and death would be imminent.

With the incident of a crash involving an autonomous car invlolved many legal issues would arise. Foremost among these potential legal disputes would be that of liabilty. While paragraph nine reveals that the majority of states do not allow autonomous cars, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."", the problem of liability, weather it be the driver or the manufacturer at fualt, still arises.

At the very forefront of all of the issues and potential problems with the idea of the autonomous car is the imminent, unavoidable threat that they would undoubtedly turn on us. As seen in Terminator 3 Judgement Day, the technology would gain a mind of its own and begin to destroy all of the humans. The cars would begin to crash themselves and run down helpless pedestrians with cute little puppies and ice cream. Most likely the cars would soon adapt after the military got involved and begin to mount machine guns, artillery and any other gun the could think of or pruduce. they would being to be made with faces and would look like a cross between Arnold and Lightning McQueen. dropping out of autonomous helicopters to destroy us all with their evilishy cute murderous faces.

While there are many other reasons and evidences for not prudicing the machine which will kill us the three most important have been touched upon today. Therefore because of the potential malfuntcion in technology, legal obscurities and impening armageddon and war between man and machine the autonomous car should not be produced or pursued any further.

225DD6CCCBBB,"I am agaisnt the devlopment of these cars. What would be the point of having a driveless car thats not really driveless. I am agaisnt the devlopment of these cars because it would be very expanisve to fix, does most thngs a human can do and driving problems may occur.

First, if the car was to break down and the sensors were messsed up it would be very expanisive to fix. According to the article, ""Totyota Prius uses position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever and an interial motion sensor'. If you were to get into a bad car crash and wrecked the car and wanted to get it fixed it will be super expansive. Mainly because all though sensors are high tech and advanced. So basically your fixing the car and paying for all the technology it needs which is going to be alot of money.

Secondly, the ""driveless"" car does mainly what humans can do theirselves. In the article it says after all the listed sensors, "" The combination of all this input is neccessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". It also says later in the article, ""They can steer, accelertae, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". If this ""driverless"" car can do what humans can do themselves then what is the point of making the car. Ecspically not if the car isnt really driving. Someone would pay all this money to do something they could have done themselves.

Lastly, with this ""driverless"" car driving problems may occur. technology does crash and does disfuction and may move faster than us. In the article it says, ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or manufactuer?"" The article makes a valid point. If those cars a developed those type of questions will need to be answered and conflict will occur. Technology can cause an accidnet just as easily as a human can but if that happens who is at fault? How would the situation be handled?

The car could be aware of its surroundings, and be able to prevent an accident from happening. The car will have sensors and will be able to tell how close an object is.

People often get distracted when driving. Whether, it's a mother trying to help her child, a teenager recieving a text, or a person is fatigue. People can only focus on so many things before something goes wrong. The driverless car would be focusing on the road no matter what. This way, the ""driver"" doesn't have to worry when looking away for a spilt second. Some people don't have fast reflexes, and can't brake on time, the senors could help with all this.

The driverless car can help with people who cannot drive, like the elderly. An elderly person cannot drive themselves around when nobody else can. WIth this car, it can solve that for them. With the elderly in this car that can drive itself, instead of the elderly person driving, it would be safer for the elder person and other people on the road. The elder wouldn't have to worry about not being able to look at the signs or farway objects anymore, since the car will be in control.

I do understand that something could go wrong with the car when in use. I beileve that there should be some sort of precautions set, in cause of faulty of product. Who would be the one to blame? It should all depend on evdience. If it was built wrong, then the manufacturer. If the person in the car knew something was wrong, and decided not to get it fix, the person is at fault for not fixing the problem before anything happened.

I beileve that driverless cars should be produce. I feel that it could change everything for the better. It could make life more simple, and easy. It could decrease car accidents.

8C37EEAE1663,"I belive that driverless cars are a good idea. Personaly, I don't trust people on the roads. People get distracted easily, can have slow reaction times, and sometimes just are not safe. Driverless cars can fix all these problems easily.

One issue is that people easily get distracted. Smart cars, on the otherhand, are complety built for the purpose of diving and analizing the roads. The feature most appealing to me and that fixes this issue is found here in the passage, "" Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."".

The second issue with drivers in cars are the drivers reaction times being to slow. Some people just do not have the reactions to be able to use the breaks fast enough to avoid accidents. These cars do it instantly, as stated in the passage, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels and reduce power from ethe engine, allowing far bettter response and control than a human driver could manage alone."".

Finaly, sometimes people just are not safe. Doing anything from texting while driving or taking erratic turns without signal can be extreamly dangerous to themselfs or anyone around them. These cars can prevent that by even forcing people to watch the road constantly or alerting us when danger is ahead. "" GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."". This is only one of many safty enhancing developments to smart cars and the protection of the ""driver"".

Driverless cars have been devoleped to be able to copy the ability of human drivers through multiple sensors and laser technology. In the article its stated ""...far better response and control than a human driver could manage"" the article is talking about the advancement in just the brakes of cars, with the technology already presented, cars that are able to copy the skills of humans and possibly even have more skill and control of the road than humans already do. Sensors along the car allow the car to view the streets and obstacules like a human does, and the addition for even more sensors just expanes the vision of a car, allowing the car to have more knowledge of the street and possible dangers that are ahead.

I think it would be fun to have cars we don't have to drive ourselfs but an issue with that is what if we do get into an accidnet in a bigger city. I'm nuetral on this topic because they aren't truly driverless ars if they still need a driver.

I don't particularly care if we get driverless cars or not. Kids have been waiting to get their license for generations, if we get driverless cars does that mean the age of legal driving decreases? Would children be able to drive, if so that's not too fair. Those kids would miss out on learning these skills to drive that everyone else had to learn.

I don't know if driverless cars is a bad thing or a good thing, but I'd rather stick to my littly chevy car. I say this becasue, I have to stay awake for either car. If i were to have a car that drove itself, I'd sleep in the back of my car until i had reached my desination. But if I'm needed to navigate through rough areas then I'd rather drive the whole way to my desination. I understand that these cars would give you a form of entertainment to keep you occupied while in the vehicle, but I'd fall asleep and wouldn't wake up when the car needed me.

It is handy though, a car like this, but one would have to wonder the cost of a car like that. Probably something none of us could afford to buy. But it would be nice to not have to worry about other cars, although when you come to a stop, although it has sensros on the car, does it sense the other driverless car? What if that car in the other line isnt't driverless and the driver decided to wave you along and let you go first, what would the car do? Does it truly function probably at an intersection?

I dont particularly care about this kind of car, I learned how to drive and I'd rather just do that. Although thus driverless car sounds safer, I'm sure it would make less mistakes than I do, I don't quite trust it.

Although, a driver can still take control when needed. The computers know know to drive and when to stop or go. In the article it states that the autonomous cars will use half the fuel of today's taxis and they are more flexible than a bus. The new cars though are not in total control, the drivers still can drive. I do not think that the driverless are a good idea and they should not be developed. They are dangerous, very expensive, and making our world more lazy.

To begin the driverless cars are extremely dangerous. Some people will have the driverless cars and some will be normal. The driverless cars let the driver take over if needed. The seats will vibrate, the voice control will come on, or any way to get the drivers attention; according to the article. What if the driver fell asleep and is a very hard sleeper. The cars might not be able to wake him or her up in time. Then, resulting in a crash or even more tragic. I think that the cars that are not driven by a computer are in danger. The driverless car will know when to stop and go at a stop light, but what if another car goes on accident and they did not mean to. It could be a pile up and a mess. The cars are just not safe enough for me to think that they should be developed.

Another reason I do not approve of driverless cars are that they are expensive. Yes, they do get better gas millage, but the cost of the cars to begin with is going to be outrageous. Somepeople and companies are not going to be able to afford the cars. The cars savings on gas will never compare to the crazy cost of them to begin with.

It states in the article that the upgrades to existing roads will be simply too expensive to be practical. I agree with this statement completely that the money will not be practical. The cars do have more flexible schedules than busses, but i would rather ride a bus than a very expensive car. There is a possibility of it getting into a crash and then you would have to get it fixed with even more bills. The car is just too expensive and crazy.

Lastly, the car in my opinion is lazy. The world today would rather have someone else care for them and for them to just relax. Yes, relaxing is nice, but you have to know what work is. The car is just another way for the world to be lazy. Driving is not that hard on your body, it is moving your feet and paying attention. The car just allows the world to have another way to be lazy. I think that it is good for your body to pay atttention and keep your eyes on the road. It makes you not drift off and think about what you are doing. The people that will have to take control after the car can't go through crashes or traffic will not be on their top watch. They probably will be sleepy or not paying attention. I just don't like to think of another way for society to have a reason to be lazy.

In conclusion, I do not agree with the development of driverless cars. They are dangerous, cost a lot of money, and they are a way for people to be more lazy. They will not benefit our society in any way. People have more control over a car than a computer. The money that people don't have should be used on food not cars. Somepeople are having a hard time providing for their family let alone having a car payment too. Also society is lazy enough without these driverless cars. The development of autonomous cars should not happen because the cars are never going to benefit society. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B7BB7AA2B5BC,"In my opinion driverless cars are a liitle more on the sketchy side in my opinion because you have to put a lot of trust into a machine.

Especially if in the future they make these cars in a factory where not a lot of time is spent of each car specifically, then a lot could go wrong.

It would help decrease pollution though which is one of this world's biggest problems right now.

Though this new concept of driverless cars would decrease pollution, there are sure many more ways that we could decrease pollution without a machine that are sketchy to put anybody in.

Such as in paragraph 7, it states that a human that is riding in the car must stay alert for any zones that calls for tough navigating and situations.

Some of these cars do watch the driver as they take over the wheel to make sure they are alert and stay awake through the process.

Overall my opinion on driverless cars is that I don't think it's the best option in the world because you do have to put a lot of trust into them.

A lot of car manufacturers have been working to improve these cars over the years, but if it came down to it, I guess we all would have to come together and make these cars as efficient as possible.     ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Having a driveless care shouldnt be aloud at all. first they could increase the the rate for czr crashes in teens. the rate is already high for them expecially in Indiana and we dont even have them kind of cars yet. Cell phones are a major role to the youth in todays time. that is the main reason for so many recks today so if you give them a car that can drive its self, they are not gone do nothing but text and not pay attention to the rode at all basically if you was to do that you are setting them up fro their own death.

Second ,by not creating these kinds of car and giving them out you could be saving your company alot of money. Because if somebody was to get in a reck and they wasnt driving but the car was driving its self they gone come to the people who made the car because they feel like it was thier fault. Even tho you told them that they still had to pay attention to the rode they not cuz they feel like the car can watch its self. so if you dont put the car on the market you can save your company alont of money and alot of stress.

Third, you wouldnt wanna be the reason for any deaths, because if you start getting so many deaths on your car nobody is going to want your car so now you then wasted money on all these cars and parts for these cars that nobody is buying so you just lost alot of money and nobobody just has money to waste. If your company starts to lose money they gone have to start cutting people because they can no longer pay you, and the first person they are going to fire are the people who came up with the idea that caused them to lose so much money in conslusion i think t would be your best bet to just not make the cars because your saving money, your saving lives so now your heros, and you dont have to worry about anybody tryong to sue you for most of everything yall got because if the person win boy yall feelings gone be hurt ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

What if the driver falls asleep and the warning signals for them to begin driving doesn't wake them up? Then you have a wreck and then who is to blame? The owner or the manufacturer? Now, you have a huge arguement that would most likely have to go into court , and the buyer is most likely going to try to sue the manufacterur.

Another reason why i am against driverless cars is because, if the sensers mess up And don't sense a person walking across the street or a wreck ahead etc. and the driver isn't paying attention because they're on their phone or something and the warnings don't go off then you have an even bigger situation than the one that was already ahead. Then if the car gets messed up in anytype of way then the driver has to pay a lot more money to get things fixed then they would with a regular car, because that type of technology isn't cheap.

Another reason is , what if its snowing out side and the roads are icey , would the car be able to drive it's self through all the ice and stuff? It barely safe driving on ice with a regular car now.

There are many reasons why I dont believe so, such as the fact that they are going to need to make logical decisions and could be dangerous to drivers and pedestrians due to the drivers not needed to pay as much attention to driving.

What does it mean for a computer to make a logical decision? Lets imagine that your in a driverless car, and your headed towards an inevidable crash that will kill you. The only way to get out of it is to go on the sidewalk, where 3 small children are playing hop-scotch. If your watching ""in-car entertainment"" and the computer decides that you need to take over at this time, there is no time for us as humans to think. This is a major problem that will come up. Unless everyone's cars are fully driverless, its hard to prevent this scenario. This would mean we would have to make traditional cars as we know it, illegal.

Fully driverless cars are coming, but there are a lot of problems that we need to address before that happens. The idea of logical decision making for a computer processing things in 1's and 0's is a hard conundrum to overtake.

There are many perks that driverless cars pertain, for example it has driven for more than a half million miles without problems reported. Also if a person wants to take control they have to oppurtunity to do so. They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in or out driveways.

In conclusion I agree about the fact that Driverless cars should prohibited because it saves money and you can still take control.

General Motors had created a concept car that could only run on a special test track , but the track was to expensive to be practical. Instead of smarter roads smart cars were made. If people wanted to look at this in a psychological aspect, this would make driving more fun. The car options for this program can be turned off when the driver needs to take over and this can be used as a safety issue. This program can help with keeping passengers safe especially the ones who make poor choices. This would help on traffic and accidents. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
992BADE2458A,"I am against the making of driverless cars. Us as human have been driving for quite a while now, and as they say ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Many people bring up the statistics of car crashes and deaths. What they do not see is that almost all of them are because the driver was impared. They could have been drinking, under the influence of a drug, texting, or distracted by some other object. There should not be driverless cars because it is too dangerous with the technology and hacking there is now, it will also cost millions or even billions of dollars,and in a dangerous situation nothing compares to the human mind.

Making these driverless cars is too dangerous because of the technology. Someone could easily get in the cars system and make it crash or break it in general. If a human was driving, that would not happen because he or she would be in control of the car. The car could also get bugs or viruses like an everyday computer does. With all the technology already in it this could make the car stop working completely. Maybe when the car stopped working the driver was coincidentally asleep or not paying attention. Then they would veer of the road injuring them or someone else. Many people would not be comfortable knowing a car is driving itself when someone could get into it and sabotage it. WIth all this fancy technology in these cars, it will not be very cheap.

It is expensive to make cars today with little technology in them, just imagine all the electronics they would have to put in the driverless cars. That would cost these companies a lot which would make these cars even more expensive for the average people. Adding this to the cost of insurance, everyone would be in debt, just for a little more safety. They say these cars have not crashed yet, but eventually some will. When that happens you will just have to buy another one. Only the very wealthy wouldbe able to afford them. Why spend all this money, when we can do it already?

In dangerous driving situations, nothing can compare to the human mind. Computers do not have emotions or reflexes to veer out of the way. If all these cars come to a four-way stop at the same time, who will know when to go first. Also these cars could not compute with all the drving situations there are. Humans do because we have experience. That is something cars cannot have. We made cars and we have learned how to use them well, why change it? We should keep having humans drive cars.

Instead of spending all this money on safer cars, let's just hit the source and fix the drivers. We could spend money on cracking down on drivers under the influence, stopping texting. If you want to spend money on cars, make one that notices when the driver is texting or has been drinking. We should not spend this money in advances insted of fixing the problem. We should not get driverless cars because the technology people can get is too dangerous, this will cost people loads of money that they need somewhere else, and these cars can't do what humans can do.

4FE5B872FE61,"Imagine this scenario: a person is faced with the future--new developments that may lead into the next era of technology. The question now is, should that person deny it or gladly accept it? If that person were me, I'd take it, as there is no point in staying the past and be outdated, and this is exactly how I see driverless cars. The problem now becomes, however, whether this technology is ""the future"" or not. In this essay I will discuss why cars are the future and thus, why I support them by covering the topics of efficency, error, and why some critics' are misguided in companion with ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"".

To start, energy is being consumed in our world at a rapid rate, and much of it comes from sources that are nonrenewable once depleted like the oil used in many cars. Many have seen the solution to switch to alternative energy sources that ARE renewable; however, this does not actually address the bulk of the problem. The problem is actually efficency. To demonstrate this, for power to reach a house from a faraway power plant, much more electricity is generated than needed as to make sure it can travel the long distance in cables without losing so much charge that the current becomes weak and useless, and a logical fix for such a problem would be to simply figure out a way to move the power source closer as to achieve higher efficencies. This same logic applies to cars in traffic, which use a lot of fuel to do essentially nothing. When I saw in the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" that Google cofound Sergey Brin--who must be very intelligent as he IS the cofounder of Google, a very widely known and used company--said that these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis AND offer far more flexibility than a bus, my only logical reaction was that this is a wonderful technology.

Transitioning to errors, a common theme of accident tragedies is the one where a person is texting and driving leading to distractions that cause the accident. This is not the only cause of accidents, though, as humans are not made to be perfect, small errors also cause accidents, but despite the wide range of things that may cause an accident, driverless cars can cover a person for that as well. My first piece of evidence for this is that driverless cars are machines, and despite having a notoriously bad reputation for failing at times due to some error during the design process, machines do not tire and do not grumble about watching their surroundings; they also need not be perfect, only better than a person to become favorable as a driver. My second piece of evidence comes from, once again, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" when it was stated that ""enetertainment and information systems that use heads up displays [...] can be turne doff instantly when the driver needs to take over [in the case that the car senses that its own computing devices are not enough to handle a situation]"". This system appealed to me a lot due to how intuitive it is; if a person shouldn't be using something, it turns off, no questions asked. All of these factors further lead me to believe that cars are ""the way of the future"".

Finally, despite all of these factors there are both criptics and critics for driverless cars. Some reasons usually brought up that haven't been addressed yet are the issues of laziness with the animated movie WALL-E coming to mind and perhaps the hacking of the systems that run these driverless cars, which is equally terrifying. The second concern being the easier and simpler of the two to address, hacking is commonly a misunderstood phenonenon. The aboslute requirement for all hacking is access to the device that someone wishes to hack usually through some internet connection on the device linked to other functions. This is easily remedied through the use of local software on the driverless car, cutting it off from the internet as well as making the entertainment and information systems independent of the driving system. Getting back to the first issue about laziness, people are still sitting down whether in a driverless car or a conventional car and that these cars will likely be extremely expensive with all the added sensors for the foreseeable future, encouraging walking as an alternative to money as well as creating a walking trend so that when these technologies are cheaper, laziness would not become a problem.

To wrap it up, I support and adore the idea of driverless cars as they are a way to support using energy more efficently rather than going out of the way to make new sources of energy; they are a way to reduce the unnecessary ending of lives as well as unecessary drama from automobile accidents (especially for me since I'm a very accident prone person); and last but not least, they are a way to promote regular walking and get automobile internet security right. After looking through all of this, I can say for certain that driverless cars will certainly be a huge advantage to our society if only we'd give them a chance because after all, everything deserves a chance and a second for making up for its mistakes.

42D6746FE68C,"The idea of driverless cars scares me. I am not for driverless cars for the fact that the expences would be through the roof, you wouldn't be responisible while driving, and it's complete laziness.

Imagine if kids were to get these kinds of cars. Think about how they would think. In their minds they will think that they could be on their phone or sleep and not have a care in the world. In the article, it states that the driver needs to be fully aware of what is going on at all times. Kids will think ""This seems like a great time to be on my phone, listen and dance to some music, or maybe even catch up on some sleep."" Kids are irrespnsible and take priveleges for granted. I, being a kid, know this.

Our world has a lot of middle class people in it that don't have the kind of money it will take to buy these kinds of cars. If our world makes this movement, what will happen to the people that can not buy these cars? Middle class and lower will have to use self-driven cars that require full attention. In this article, it doesn't state whether or not we will have to change how our rodes are made, but I would think that there would have to be some kind of change to them in order for this to work fully. Therefore, what will happen to the people with the self-driven cars?

I feel like this whole idea is based completely out of laziness. I feel it is just an excuse to be irrespnsible and let a robot do everything for us. I don't feel that this a step in the right direction for man kind. I do believe it may create less accidents, but I don't feel okay with it at all. In my mind, I believe that this one idea can lead to the idea of self-driven chairs. I think if we ever get to this point we are going to end up like one of the movies I watched as a kid, ""Wall-e"". In the world setting of ""Wall-e"", human beings are completely supported by machines. These humans are over weight and have barely any muscle anymore. Personally, I don't want our world to end up this way and think it will if we continue to support these experiments.

98DEE4145A34,"Driverless cars are not good because they could be dangerous because machines and equipment are known to malfunction. It is a proven fact that factory equipment, power tools, and even common cellphones malfunction, so it could pose a huge danger if a car were to malfunction.

When a human is driving a car and makes a mistake, yes it is bad that they made a mistake, but at least you can hold somebody responsible for it and have them move on from their mistake. If there is no driver and the car malfunctions on its own, yes you can improve the car, but can you hold the car responsible? One can certainly move on and gain knowledge from making mistakes, its how mankind evolves, but just how far can you force a car to evolve is the question... What if one day a car on a highway moving 70 mph malfunctioned and started spinning out of control. No would would be able to stop it because it is so ""evolved"" that the car is expected to just ""do it on its own"", but what if it falters in a moment of weakness and can't?

Also, humans are ever growing in knowledge and expanding their horizons of learning, but just how far can a car actually go? Just how much can you teach a car before you can't teach it anymore? This could become an issue when it comes to road safety improvement because yes, technology is always evolving and improving, but how far are we willing to go in letting technology take over our whole lives?

I am against these cars because they are not completely independent. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" This means that the driverless cars are not compatable to fully being able to drive alone. The driver in the car would have to be alert when a situation has approached.

CD70501C85E3,"The author discusses the good and the bad of these cars. The author talks about how they could easily replace buses and/or other methods of transportation. Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impratical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further. For the reason that it would be much safer with drivers and we do not need to change much then.

With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themself safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require human skill rather than the car doing it all.

If we were to have these driverless cars, we might have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety. Like the author says, if someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer. Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed?

To conclude, the driverless cars should not be further developed. They could potentially put a person in danger, they would not be very cost effective, and a lot would need to be changed.

The idea is to drive the auto motive indeustry on showing people that there is a way that they can recieve transpotation and not have to do any work at driving the car. Personally I think of it as annother way for someone to be lazy.

I love driving and I do not want a company that created a web site making a driverless car that will take over America's roads. At the begining of this article it says, ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" I don't want to immagine that because I want the future generations to feel the sense of accomplishment that I felt when I first started driving my car, also there are so many different cars that it would be hard to make a driverless car that can replace all of them. How would a self driving car ever replace the adrenalin pumping speed of a car like a Corvette Z06 or Chellenger HellCat. The purpose of cars like these is to go as fast as you want when you want to. How would a driverless driving car give that is disigned to go the speed limit give you them type of enjoyment as the cars that I just listed.

Since 2009 google has had cars that can drive automatic under certain conditions, but no driverless car has been truly driverless. Although driverless cars have a lot of positive aspects about them, there are more negative. I believe they are wrong.

First, they are not safe. Not one driverless car has been able to drive safely without the help of a actual driver. If road costruction, accidents, or roadblocks come up then the driver must help and take over. So, If the driver falls asleep in the vehicle and doesn't hear the warnings that help is needed then there could be a crash or collision.

Second, the amount of money that would need to be put into this action. If driverless cars were to become a part of today's society then we would be wasting alot of money to make one car. What if people can't afford to pay for a self-driving car? Then will the smart cars still be able to risk the possibility of crashes when all the other cars or drivers on the street aren't safe. The smart car can't detect everything. To make a driverless car the vehicle needs a lot of sensors. Sensors are not cheap and the car needs a lot of them, that's roughly a couple million dollors.

Lastly, the technology could fail. To have driverless cars you would need to do a lot of updating to keep everything udated with today's traffic laws and more. If a law is changed or a new stop sign is added or stop light then the technolgy could fail and cause a crash or collision. Then who's fault is it? The driver for not helping the car when needed or the manufacturer who made the car the way it is.

Although driverless cars have a lot of postive aspects about them, there are more negative. I believe they are wrong.

If the driverless cars will have sensors and the driver will have to have fast reaction times to help the car if needed. To me safety is more important then anything.

Driverless cars are for the future, but anything is possible for the future. There are many possible things that could happen. The car could be a succesful invention. Then again it could be a failure. Nobody wants to be in harms way right? In the passage it says "" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"" to me I think it will take more than four years to invent these cars and mass produce them.

To me driverless cars has many pros and many cons. For instance the passage says that "" New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident"" then, the passage goes on and says "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" What if one of the sensors become defaulted? Wouldn't that be a manufacturing problem?

Driverless cars can be useful, but could be harmful to the surroundings if the technology malfunctions. What would you do if you was driving a driverless car and it maulfunctions and crashes into the car next to you and you find out the people in the other car are dead? Would you feel quilty or would you not? Driverless cars can be the future, but I think the inventioina and concept of the car shoukd be taken more serious. To me the maufacturers are just looking to make money.

To me as a person i take safety very serious. I think the safety concept of the vehicles should be one of the more serious things the manufacturers should look at if produced. They should only give a certain amount of driverless cars out incase the technology fails. There won't be much chaos if the technology malfunctions.

Driverless cars are the future for the world. I don't really like the concept, but it's the future and anything is possible. Driverless cars have many pros and cons. The cars can be useful, but then they could be harmful to it's surrounding safety wise. If the driverless cars will have sensors then what's the use for the person to have to be cautious at all times for?

8DDDD842BDDD,"Driverless cars are beingcoming more and more common with each day that the technology is evolving. I believe that in the next 30 years we will have driverless cars all over the place.

Many car companies today are well on their way to developing driverless cars, simple autonomous cars have been tested since 2009, with many car companies rushing to learn what they can about it. The reason it wasn't happening before then was because they lacked the technology. Back then, a radar was an object on a hill that cost over 200 million dollars, not something you could put on a car and use to help it on the roadways.

Driverless cars are not a bad idea, they can improve safety because they are more precise and can respond quicker to any situation thrown at them by todays everchanging road ways and transportation infrastructure. If we can improve driver and passeneger safety, why not take the chance to develop something for the future. So far, many of the tests on these cars have proven successful 90% of the time. Volvo hopes to have their first driverless car publicly available in 2020.

I believe driverless cars are going to happen somewhere in my lifetime, I won't use them because I prefer to drive myself, but I can see many using them because of their saftey.                                        ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
63D7648C9304,"Driverless cars are an innovation to the 21st century that have been dreamed of and worked on for many decades.

Many people have dreamed of driverless cars but couldn't share their dreams in a tangable form because the technolgy to make these futuristic automobiles did not exist at the time, but just recently this has changed.

There has been much debate on driverless cars with many skeptics.

My positon on driverless cars are that the automotive and technology industries should merge together and share their ideas to embrace this new form of transportation many people have been dreaming for.

Not only would driverless cars be more convenient but would aslo be much safer.

All drivers have human error but if there was to be and an intelligent, automonous computer driveing there would be little to no crashes.

Fully automonous vechicles are still many years away, but laws of many states prohibit testing of driverless vechiles.

These laws are causing the consumer to wait longer because companies need important development testing to be conducted in order to improve and devlop these cars.

Driverless Cars have many imortant and reliable senors have been put strategically on the cars to maximize efficency.

For example Google's modified Toyota Prius has position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel and a rotating sensor on the roof with many other senosors.

The sensor on the roof is the Dubbed LIDAR and is one of the most important one.

The LIDAR makes a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. This allows the car to see all of its surrondings unlike the human eye which can on see one direction.

Driverless cars are coming to the marketplace and the consumer needs a relible and well tested car but with laws in place companies will not be able to devlop and test their cars to the best of their ablities.

I am completely for driverless cars for a more convenient and safer future and driverless cars are a step to that dream.

Thousands of people die in horrific crashes each year and to limit progress of trying to make the roads safer is just wrong.    ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
22A524F5D5F2,"Against the developing of driverless cars. Driverless cars will we a dangerous hazard, they require a lot of sensors, a ready driver, specific conditions and waiting on the law.

Driveless cars require a lot of sensors without any sensors the cars would not be able to go forward, backwards, applying breaks, reducing power from the engine or drive themselves because the sensors are what keeps them from crashing into other vehicles.

Driverless cars need a read driver at a times. The vehicle can handle driving functions at speed up to 25 miles per hour, but require a driver to keep a hold of the steering wheel. These cars will give you signal telling you it is time to take over the steering wheel becasue the road conditions, construction site or an accident is happening or occured ahead.

When the car is driving itself it needs to have specific road or navigation conditions. If there has been an accident, a construction site or traffic the car might signal you to take over the wheel and let you drive instead because it can't drive itself through these conditions. This mean that the driver has to be alert and ready to take over when the situation requires.

There are traffics laws stating that only a safe car has a human driver in control at all times. And as a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. So far California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars.

Driveless cars will be a dangerous hazard because they require a lot of sensors, a ready driver, and specific conditions in order to run properly. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
7672EBD9ACD3,"Car accidents have become a growing problem around the world. Anything from drunk driving to texting and driving has caused people to injure and even take the lives of many people. The development of computer-driven cars have the purpose of using innovative technology to prevent these events from occuring while also allowing drivers to have more freedom behind the wheel. Everyone should switch to computer-driven cars once they are fully developed because they contain sensors that allow the car to carry out many of its own functions, are able to alert the driver if their assistance is needed, and have in-car systems that prevent accidents that would occur through texting and driving.

To begin, these computer-driven cars already have many featurres that allow the car to do the same thing as if a human was driving. The article on driverless cars states,¨ BMW announced the development of

¨Traffic Jam assistant.¨ The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph.¨(driverless cars are coming 7) allowing everyday drives to the gas station or the grocery store to be eliminated and the simple act of getting into the car as if it were a cab, to be carried out. Also,¨ They can steer, acelerate, and brake themselves.¨ (driverless cars are coming 7) shows that the cars are just as handy as if a human was driving them.

Next, other sensors alert the driver as needed. In case there is construction or another type of barrier that might confuse a driverless car, there are sensors to alert the human in the car that they are needed. The driverless cars will have installed,¨ in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.¨(driverless cars are coming 8) allowing for a fun ¨Drive¨ to the destination while also having a safe one. To further support this idea,""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over.¨ (driverless cars are coming 8) reassures the idea that one can enjoy the ride while also knowing they are safe and can take over when necessary.

Lastly, driverless cars can prevent accidents caused by cell phone use while driving. Cell phone users are not aware of where the car is going if they are looking at their phone. When the article says,¨ something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone.¨ (driverless cars are coming 8) reffering to the heads-up system, it creates a feeling of saftey knowing one can still be interacting with technology while being aware of what is going on with the car. Also, ¨ In this way, the car-system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.¨ ( driverless cars are coming 8) seals the deal that driverless cars are a innovative new way to prevent accidents through cell phone use.

The ability to carry out similar functions as if a human were driving, the addition of sensors that alert the driver when needed, and the ability to prevent more car accidents through cell phone use are what make driverless cars a necessity to the world. Though some have argued it would be hard to trust the technology, tests have proven otherwise. The technology and innovativness of the car are very promising. Ultimately, having a driverless cars is what everyone needs.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
CF0AA3E3DF6D,"My position on diverles cars is that im all for it. They seem like a very cool and interresting thing to have. Some cars can drive up to half a million miles without a crash. They also can alert people to take over when puing out of drive ways or dealing with traffic issues.

The diverles cars also give us time to do things. They give us time to do our makeup or call someone. If you did that before you whould get ina car crash. The car basicly detects everything in its way. The car whouldnt always be driving its self u whould need to come in once in awhile.

They have many companies who are making driverles cars. The companies beleive that its not the smart car .They belive the roads need to be smarter in general. The roads chould give the car signals from the front of the car. The car read positive and negitive polarity as messages in binary code .They thought the roads wernt going to work but they did.

Finally,they concluded that these smart cars chould work really wel for peole one day. The only thing is that u whould have to watch the road just to make sure everything is going okay. Without the idea of smart roads you whouldnt have smart cars .The cars basicly are smart cars because of the smart roads.

F48F4BE3040E,"In today's world technology has taken over. Driverless cars are starting to develop. Is this a good or bad thing? Some may see it as good, but in my opinion driverless cars are a bad thing.

Driverless cars have more risks rather than a human operated vehichle. One of those risks or concerns that was pointed out in the article is what if the technology is to fail? If the car is operating on it's own and a wreck happens; who is to blame? Is it the manufacturer for faulty technology or the driver? Either way this would cause more problems with who's fault it would be if a wreck were to happen and could cause major legal troubles. Another thing that goes along with technology failur is the safety of everyone in the vehicle and everyone around. The technology would not be able to sense a problem or poor driving conditions like a human operator would be able to. The technology would not be able to react and adjust to these situations.

Another downside the article pointed out was the driverless cars are not entirely driverless. The car would still need an operator to be allert and ready to take over. So what is the point of a driverless car if they still need an operator? The point the article made, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" This is a relateable statement it would get boring sitting there having to be allert but not doing anything. It would get really tiring after a wile. The article talked about putting in-car entertainment in the cars, but if someone were too invested in the entertainment of the car they would not be allert if the car would need the operator to take over. This could cause crashes and put the safety of people in danger.

Driverless cars are not a good idea. They have not figured out the legal work that would go along with it. If a car were to crash they have no way of knowing who is at fault. The safety of people is put at risk. The cars are not even completly driverless they still need an allert operator ready to take over if a problem occured. Driving should be the responsibility of a human not a computer. Driverless cars are not where our future should be heading.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
15412ACAC038,"In this article we have seen that technology has been coming along quiet a bit. I didn't even know that since 2009 driverless cars have been around. Whether we realize it or not they're developing in our society more than we could've ever imagined. Have you ever watched a television show or movie where the car can drive itself? I know what your thinking wow that would be so cool, a self operating car. Believe it or not Google has done that already.

The risk of having cars that operate themselves will result in alot more car crashes for teenagers, and that will result in insurance being increasing for the parents. Everyday there are over 1,000 crashes that involve teenagers being reckless drivers. In the article the author states"" Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" The key word from that statement is alert. Teenages already are not alert the way it is, and now we want to give them the opprotunity to be even more reckless. In today's generation we have the distractions of cellphones, friends, and mostly technology. Most teenages drive with there cellphones and over 2,000 per day get in a car crash because the use of technology behind the wheel.

I personally am against it myself, even though I'm a teenager and think that would be cool. I still have the maturity to realize that being behind the wheel of an automobile is a privelege, and its a big responsibilty. When your behind the wheel of the moving vehicle you need to be an alert driver. Part of being an alert driver is having you hands on the wheels at all times, because at any moment the car could get out of control and the next thing you know you're in a ditch. I think its so fascinating how much technology has come over the years, but today's generation gets overwhelmed with all of the technology that is thrown at us.

D046D73CA939,"Have you ever thought of how future cars may look like? With technolongy rapidly increasing each year, in the next couple of years cars might be the ones doing all the driving without the need of people controlling it. In other words, in the future there could be the invention of driverless cars. Now, do you think this would be a good idea or not so much? Well, in the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, the author points out a few postitive and negative features.

Since a few years ago Google modifies a Toyota car into a smarter car. A couple of these upgrades involoved the wheels to include a sensor and a Dubbed LIDAR, which allowed the driver to be constantly notifies of the car/s surrounding. This it's self is very useful. It caused the number of accidents to decrease due to the driver being constantly notified. Of course these are all examples of postiive features of a car, but do not make the car completely driverless.

Another major feature was a development called, ""Traffic Jam Assistant'. This new develpoment did not quite make the car completely driverless either. Although it did involve the driver not to control the car as much. This feature had the ability to get the driver where they needed to be as long as there was'nt any need for human skills. Even if there was'nt any need of human skills, one still had to be aware of the road. Mainly this feature made driving easier but not completely driverless.

Towards the end of the article the author points out a couple negative aspects. The author mentions that safety is best assured when the driver is in control of the car at all times. So, in reality having a driverless car would not be the best or safest idea. That is because, if complete driverless cars would come to invention the car would be completely running through technology. Technology is not always assured. The technologu that makes the car safely drive on its own may fail which will lead to an accident without the alert of the driver.

Overall, in my opinion I do not think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think it would lead the number of accidents per year increase rather than decreasing or staying stable. I do think having those new developments of technology are helpful into making the driver more caution though. These new developments still require the driver to be fully aware of the road and their surroundings. Unlike driverless cars, they would seem to allow the drivers to ""relax"". This would cause drivers not to have a quick response in case of an accident where the technololgy of the car fails or for any apparent reason. Driverless cars do sound fun and nice at first, but once you take your thoughts into more deepth I do think you would be second thinking your thoughts.

Drivers still have to be aware because you never know what can happen. The cars are also dangerous because it is not truly driverless, it may not alert you sometimes, and and can cause you accidents in a constrution area.

Driverless cars aren't truly driveless. They can cause bad accidents because of that. The driver should always stay alerted while in the car because anything can happen. In the text it informs us that ""Google driverless cars have driven more than a half a million miles without a crash."" I'm sure the drivers were still alerted so they wouldn't crash.

The driverless may not alert you sometimes. You never know when something can go wrong with the car that can mess up the alert system. In the text it say ""they can steer, accelerate , and brakes themselves,"" that can be a bad thing because if the car had a problem it could use one of those in the wrong situation like accelerating in a workzone area or braking on the expressway.

It can also cause you to have accidents in a constrution work area. Driverless cars aren't perfect so it can mess up at anytime. It basically have a mind of it own so you should always be alert.

They also allow drivers to not have to be in full control as they would have had in normal cars today. Although these would be some very helpful things and would be more economically friendly, driverless cars prove to be very risking and there are just too many questions about ensuring safety for them to be allowed today.

Driverless cars could possibly be dangerous to the driver, other drivers, or people walking around on the street. As of now no driverless cars have been developed that are completely driverless. At any point the car could run into a problem where it needs a person's assistence. This person may not always pay attention like they should and they may not be able to interfere with the problem quick enought to prevent harm.

In these cars the chances of something to go wrong is likely. An accident may occur and the person to blame would be a very good question. The accident may have occured because something went wrong technologically with the car. Another possible thing is the car did not give enough time for the driver to be able to quickly react to the situation. If this were to happen would the driver be at blame because he should have been able to react quicker or should have paid more attention? Or should the car be blamed because it should have sensed the problem?

The chance of something going wrong with the cars and the technology is something else to pay attention to. As of today we can see that there is nearly something that goes wrong with technology daily. The chances of something going wrong with them and causing an accident is very high. The cars review sensors may not detect a young kid laying on the ground trying to recieve his ball that just rolled under the car. This car would then sense there is nothing there and roll over the poor kid. These cars may also read the road wrong or navigate wrong. These errors could cause you to drive on the wrong side of the road or take you down a one way street the wrong way. When you are driving down the road and a situation were to occur that caused you to react quickly how will the car know what to do in the certain scenario?

Driverless cars are definitely a good way in saving your time and energy, but they also can harm you. There are many questions about how safe these cars would be and who to blame if something were to go wrong. Driverless cars are another piece of technology and something could go wrong that could quite possibly endanger the lives of many people. At this time there are too many questions about the driverless cars that need to be answered. But once they are answered and proven to be safe, driverless cars could be the next way of transportation.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

This idea of driverless cars seems cool and everything, but we have to look at what could happen if something went wrong? If driverless cars did become a thing not only could a couple people could have them everyone would have to have them. I say this because if there are half driverless cars, and have cars that people still drive there will be more wrecks, and problems if we had half and half.

Driverless cars will nit only take away the risk of human error but will help to decrease accidents that are happening all around the world because of human error. Humans make more mistakes than machines, so driverless cars are less prone to be in accidents.

Machines are very accurate and make very few mistakes if any. As paragraph two says, ""Televisions and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" Driverless cars would be a huge breakthrough in science and engineering. I think that there shouldnt be any driverless cars right now, but in a few years the technology that will be out will be safe and trustworthy. I would trust driverless cars in a few more years when the technology is more advanced and sophisticated. In paragraph 2 it says, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars arent truly driverless."" The big car companies agree that the driverless car technology wont be out for a couple of more years because it is too dangerous right now to trust them, they say that cars arent truly driverless yet when it comes to driving in traffic jams or in construction zones because there are some problems that we probably dont know about yet, but through time we can figure out to make the driverless cars more safe.

Another reason why driverless cars would be a better go to is because it coul help from polluting the atmosphere with exaust. In paragraph 1 Sergey Brin envisions fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system that uses half of the fuel that taxi cabs use today. With less fuel consumption, the evnironment and atmosphere will not get as polluted with gas exuast. Also, with less fuel being consumed by the cars, There will be less money spent on gas which could help you save money fo more things that you want.

Another feature that you can get from driverless cars is relaxing and spending more time with the people you are with. If you are by yourself you could catch up with the news or take a quick nap and get some extra rest for wherever you are going. In paragraph 8 it says, ""Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" So while you are kicked back in your seat you can turn on a movie or bring a book and enjoy your book while your car transports you to your destination.

Even though it may seem like a really cool invention there is a lot of things that can go wrong while in operation of the car. So no, I don't think that driverless cars are a good idea because it may cause accident, we don't know how the technology will react in extreem measures, and the driver may be distracted by everything that is going on behind the weel.

Many, many things can go wrong for example wihle driving the technology in the driverless car can malfunction and cause an accident, or while in operation the driver may not be able to stop the driverless car and also cause an acciedent. Theres a whole bunch of things that can go wrong while uding a diverless car. For example the driver might get distracted in times where the car alrets the driver to take over. The driver may not know how that senerio will play out. More so when the driver isn't paying any attention to the road and what the driverless car is doing. Another example would be that the technolgy might fail under extreem measure like when it's at a 4-qay intersection it may not stop, the car may not relize that it was to stop untill it's too late and an accident is cause, just because the car didn't see what was going on or there may have been a glitch that caused an accident. All of these things that can happne need to be taken into account. Because in all honesty we can't always depend on the new and cool technology that comes out of the years, have of the new technology that come outs, all the the technolgy may have many glitches and maybe no one will notice on time untill it's too late, untill an accident is caused. In the text it stated that ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelarate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navagating throughwrok zones and around accidents.""

i understand that most drivers are alert and ready when it comes to these types of situations, but what about the ones that don't pay a whole lot of attention to the road while they're driving? How are they going to deal with the driverless car malfuntioning or notifying them that they need to take acion when it's needed? I feel that diverless cars will propose a lot more accidents when the car itself get more popular.

There is a lot of factors that are involed than it just being a cool invention or a cool thing to be able to drive. There is a lot that goes into making sure that the car is safe for human use and making sure that it won't cause a lot more accidents that are needed.

This aspect here, further explains how and why the driverless cars are a more safer use of transportation for people. Even though there are negative aspects to the driverless cars, the improvements being made can make the cars safer as well. ""GM has developed driver""s seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" These cars would be more effective because they are making drivers, themselves, more aware of what is going on around them. Regular cars today, make it difficult for people to use transportation, than driverless cars actually would. ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus."" The driverless cars are going to allow people to be worry-free about getting from place to place, as well as the amount of gas that it usually takes. To clarify, I am for these cars because they are a better way of using transportaton.

In conclusion, the driverless cars are making driving become more safe and efficient. The manufactures are aware of the changes that are going on in the society today, therefore the improvements of these cars are becoming relevant to the world around us. I am for the driverless cars because I believe that they are going to eventually shape the future of the world's public transportation system.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
ABE91534EDD7,"In my opinion, driverless cars are a bad idea.

Yes, I get that it would save fuel and be much more convenient for everyday life, but i think it would cause more problems.

I think it is unnecassary to try to make these driverless cars becuase it could cost a lot, and end up not working out in the long run

First off, in my eyes these driverless cars would just cause more problems for everyday life.

These driverless cars would have trouble getting through complicated areas such as detours, road blocks, parking lots, etc.

And even though there are positive effects for this type of car, I think there are many more negative effects that could put lives at risk, and waste a lot of time getting places.

Do we have the technology to make these driverless cars happen?

Absolutely, but the risk/reward is not worth it in my opinion.

Whats wrong with just hopping in your car and driving it yourself?

""Backseat"" drivers that try to tell the actual drivers what to do are already bad in todays world, just imagine a backseat driver trying to yell at a robot driving their car.

Overall, I think trying to make these driverless cars a reality is not worth the time or money.

It would be much easier and safer to have humans controlling their cars and evaluating the situation through their own eyes to mkae the judgement on what or what not to do.

I do not see anything wrong with todays ways of transportation so why fix something thats not broken?",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
116175C40C8D,"Would Google make things easy by making a driverless car or would you stick with a normal passenger car? In my understanding I never knew google was trying to make a way to have driveless cars. Im thinking is it safe, will it help with transportation, and will it be alot of technology problems to control. Here is reson why that might be good to have driveless cars.

First,Google been working on this project for years. In the passege, it says,"" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.""Google is trying to find companies that are willing to help or have some type of different thing that would make driveless cars better and smarter. In the text, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special tets track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the cars.

Here are reason they might not be good to have. In paragrph 2, it says,"" Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with complicated traffic issues"". Are they reliable for navigation or accidents? Google thinks by using laser and updated sensors would help the car."" The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there"", said in paragraph 6.

Google is trying to help and make ways to have good, easy technology. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written with the assumpton that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars.""

In conclusion, Google and other companies are trying to make things better for people in this world with new technology. Is it good for them to make this is type of product or new machineries? This story tells everything about it and if its right for people in communies safety. I think it might be good to have driverless cars.

21868C40B94F,"Driverless cars have been argued and talked about for years. There are many aspects that make the driverless car seem irresistable. However, there are a few concerns about driverless cars that are completely understandable. Driverless cars are a positive asset for this country. These cars will shape our future and change our world for the better. There have been many bumps in the road for the developement of driverless cars. This will not deter the developers though and many people are still working on them today. Not only will they help form our future, they will help improve the present.

Currently, only a few companies are working on driverless cars. Some of these companies include, General Motors, Google, and BMW. The birth of driverless cars started with special tracks that the cars could drive on. In the late 1950s, General Motors worked on a car that would run on a certain road. This road sent radio signals to the car itself and this is how the car would drive. This supported the idea that we didn't need a smarter car; we needed a smarted road. This system worked incredibly well; however, this idea was too expensive. After the reality of special tracks failed, engineers started working on smarter cars. This created a problem at first because the technology was not yet advanced enough to create driverless cars.

In 2013, BMW had developed a car that could handle driving up to twenty-five miles per hour. The driver still had to pay attention to drive occasionally and the car wasn't perfect. Google had been working on a car that could drive itself since 2009. In the reading it talks about how the technology to create driverless cars was not there. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project mentions, ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something intersting."" He is refering to the driverless cars. The cars made in 2009 were suprisingly successful. However, the cars were not one hundred percent driverless. The google cars still needed a driver that could take over in certain conditions. This brought up the arguemtn, would people want a driverless car that they had to drive. However, in a few years the technology should be able to make these cars almost completely driverless. The argument of allowing driverless cars is on-going. There are many facts that make using driverless car seem like a good idea

One of the facts that support the driverless car is that by using driverless cars, we would use half the fuel of today's taxi system. This means we would save more money, and save the planet at the exact same time. The driverless car would have more flexibility than a bus as well. You would call the car to your house and then let it take you wherever you needed to go. A driverless car would allow for shorter travel times because the driver would be able to take breaks. This would result in the driver arriving places quicker. Driverless cars would decrease the amount of crashes as well. These cars would eliminate human error while driving. Stop lights would not be run, and police wouldn't have to chase after cars because they would have to go the speed limit. This would cause the crime rate to go down as well. The last thing needed to have driverless cars on the road is making in legal in more states. A passage from the reading states, ""California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Colimbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous car."" The cars driven in these states have been relatively sucessful. The rest of the country should use this as an example and consider allowing driverless cars.

Driverless cars are an idea of the future. However, that future is closer than many believe. These cars will limit gas, reduce crime rate, and decrese travel time. Driverless cars are an incredibly brilliant idea for America and soon the whole planet. The technology will soon allow for completely driverless cars. This will improve the world. Driverless cars are a positive asset for this country. Hopefully, driverless cars will be incorporated in daily life soon. In conclusion, instead of stressing out about driving, people will be able to sit back and let the car drive.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B63358D526BC,"Driverless cars are no doubt going to be the future of the automotive business, making our roads modernized. Having driverless cars will be a great thing for our future. Once everyone starts driving them there will be less accidents, no more gridlock, and the economy will boom.

Due to the huge influx of cash that the automotive business industry would get our economy might possibly pull itself from the grave and make us be able to abolish our debt.

All throughout history our goal has been to better our way of life by creating new technology for safety reasons and for ease of life. The automotive industry is not exempt from this, throughout history we have been making changes to vehicles so that we may go faster while being safer. One of the ways we do this is with the revolutionary technology of sensors which allow the computers in our vehicles to sense and see things that humans can not. Sensors have gone a long way since they have been invented; at first they were just used to let a computer see things, now they can predict a head on collision or when your going to lose traction on ice. So why not just let them control the car indefinately if they are able to brake, drive, and regain control of the vehicle even better than a human can. This is why there should be driverless cars at some point in our future, hopefully sooner rather than later.

The one thing holding us back from being able to discover what driverless vehicles are like is the laws that we have set in place so that a vehicle is only safe when their is a human in it driving. What they don't consider when they makes these laws is that if everyone had a driverless car then they would all be programed to drive correctly and in sync without ever needing to worry about trusting another driver or knowing when your turn is at a intersection. The vehicles would be able to sense if the other vehicles are there and be able to decided exactly what they are spose to do without the emotions like trust and doubt clouding its judgement.

Driverless cars is the future of modern technology and the future of road safety. There will be no more gridlock due to sensors and computers talking to eachother. There will be no more worrying about what speed to drive in snow or if it is too icy. The vehicles would be able to tell us all of this and compute it even better than a human could. With how fast our technology including sensors has come since 2000 driverless cars could be right around the corner and be safer, faster, and more. Driverless vehicles are our future and it is a good one.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
0BE33955BC8C,"Driverless cars are coming and are closer than we think. Driverless cars are a phenomenal idea becauase they're innovative,all major car compaines are moving toward the driverless way and they're safe. This essay will disscuss these three reasons on why driverless cars are a phenomenal idea.

First driverless cars are overwhelmingly innovative. It states in the passage ""Originally,many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads"". This is putting into perspective that even futurists didn't believe it was possible but Google has achieved this monument to perfection. Also in the ariticle it says ""founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream"". As the original founder of this project he has even reached the level of innovation that he has been striving and working for since 2009.

Secondly alot of major car companies are striving for making their product driveless. For example in the passage it conveys ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time"". This is shownig how a major car company as innovative as Tesla is going to release a self driving car of their own. In that same paragraph it informs ""Mercendes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"". Showing that even some of the luxury brands and the major car compaines are releasing a driverless car. Showing how they agreee with where the future is going and how much of a phenomenal idea it is.

Lastly, the driverless cars are safe and take limitless precatious to stay safe. It describes in the article ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearveiw mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"". This derscribes how many preperations is took for the car to be very safe.

2E6230521AC4,"I support driverless cars for many reasons. The main reason is safety. Another reason I support these cars is because they will be smarter and better drivers than an average person. In the end, this could also end up saving many people a lot of money on gas. Driverless cars could be a bright future.

In order to get these cars to be legal and available for purchase and driving, the safety of people must be a sure thing. This means car manufactures will have to work hard to ensure that safety will not be a concern for the driver, other drivers, or anyone else. Technology has advanced to the point where computers know more that most of the general population, so taking the wheel out of the hands of the driver for about ninety percent of the time is actually a lot safer than leaving it in their hands.

People tend to make many mistakes while driving, and that can cause problems. But letting a car drive itself could end up being the best idea ever. A car that knows where it's going will be less likely to make a mistake than a human driver. This could help to aviod accidents, accidently or purposely breaking the law, and other dangerous situations.

These cars also are suppose to save people money on gas, because it wouldn't use as much gas as cars do now. If it uses have the gas as cars do now, people won't to buy gas as often. That can save people money. Money is always a factor in every situation. The more you save, the better.

In conclusion, I support driverless cars. They can end up being safer than humans driving cars, they can be smarter, and they can use less gas. Driverless cars seem to have more ups than downs. I hope to see driverless cars become a big thing in the near future.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

If people strat growing up in a generation where you dont ahev to drive and the car will drive for you what are they learning. NOTHING! becaus ethere just learnmng how to be aware with the car not how to actually drive. Yes technology is advancing but that doesnt mean that all the Technology is the safest. Cars something that you have to learn how to drive not just something that learns how to drive its self. kids shouldnt have to be glued to technology 24/7 unless you in school please books in school be so heavy i swear to god imma have back troubles when i get older we just need i pads in our school but no our schools poor af.

Anyways back to the car thing. There reasoning is okay i guess but what happens when your driving onthe highway and your car senses something and stops automatically and everyone behing you is going 60 - 70 mph and crashes into you what happens then?

Its okay to have like those little beepy sensors and the little camera in the back of your car so you can see whats behind yopu when you back out but having a driverless car just seems to risky. Another point is that there are so many other problems in this world beside trying to figure out how to advance car technology . why dont they use that money to try to help cure cancer or help people in need not trying to make money but instead give bck people trhese days only care about themselves and there stupid fancy driverless cars instead of thinking about a child who doesnt even know what a car is. People these days kep on making up more excuses to be lazy just drive your car your self .

Kids are growing up in a world where there not gonna know how to do anything by themselves there always gonna depend on technology or something to help them through life. people honestly need to stop depending on technology to do everything for them its stupid i dont need my phone with me every second of the day unlike some kids i can actually put it up and i wouldnt need a car to drive me around because im not lazy i can drive myself. so many people are lazy and its so aggitating to know that people cant even freaking get in car and drive themselves they have to make technology to have the car drive its slef",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

855FC08FC096,"Driverless cars can be a positive thing because it can prevenet fewer accidents, notifies when it wants the driver to take control of the wheel, and it can help a lot of disabled people.

First, we can prevent fewer accidents because when people are drinking they won't have to worry that much about crashing or spending their money on taxis for when they want to go home. They still have to be careful so when the car tells them to take the wheel, they are ready for it. As well with younger people, when they first start driving they can be lessed worried that they will have an accident, but it will be difficult to get them to focus since they aren't at the wheel. Younger drivers will be distracted by texting.

Secondly, it notifies the driver when there is danger. As it tells you in paragraph five, ""...those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" Since 2013, the BMW have modified a car that will vibrate a drivers seat when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.""Paragraph seven informs the reader about everthing the BMW has done so that the car can drive by itsself.

Lastly, when you really think about it not only will these cars prevent fewer accidents and notify when it wants the driver to take control of the wheel but it can help a lot of disabled people. For those people who have a hard time driving this would be perfect for them because it's basically driving by itsself and they would rarely touch the wheel.

In the article it had said that they would be having ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and NIssan"" cars that can drive themselves by 2020. Just think of if that actually happened how many people would be obese and not getting exercise. Yeah driving really is not a form of physical fitness.

There are some positives like it could make driving safer for some people and teens that are not so good driving and how to hold their hands etc.. All in all It could go both ways it could be good and bad. I honestly seeing it ending badly but that is just my opinion. I do not think that having cars that can drive theirself is a good idea.

Secondly, the money we tax payers would have to pay on new roads. Lastly, the drivers being too tired to drive themselves. Are most of these problems worth being lazy?

Human life is such a miracle on its own, do we really need a piece of techonogly to take us to the grave? Driverless cars steer, accerlerate,and brake themselves, but what if the cars do that at the wrong time. I certainly would not want to be in a drivers seat without having control. Technology is never perfect, and not realible enough to run a car. Granted that most cars are made of technology, but not driven by technology. I would not want any of my family being harmed because a driverless car having a malfunction. Technology does not have a life, but we certainly do.

Taxes goes towards schools, street repairs, lazy people, and many more things. Is it right that we would have to pay for another problem? If we switched to driverless cars we would need ""smart-road sytems"". This system is way too dangerous and expensive to even consider. What about all the country roads and streets? Would these driverless cars still be able to function?

Over the past one hundred years, us as a nation have begun to be too lazy. Laziness and being tired are two completely different things. Have we seriously gotten lazy enough to have a driverless car? Why would you buy a car if you could not fully drive it? If you are that lazy, there are buses, subways, and taxi's. Plus, if you were really that tired, would you really want technology driving you around? Would you feel safe in the arms of technology?

These are all things that could simply be avoided by Driverless Cars not coming to market.

Not only is this whole concept outragously dangerous, but the question of liability also has to come into play. In the event of an accident where technology fails and someone is injured someone would have to figure out who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer.

Like what the article said sensors are nothing new and have been around since the 1980's. The technolgy has always been there for example movie players, cameras, GPS. The car companies have probably thought of the idea of hands free driving for a long time. No company had the nerves to do it because they were afraid of some not paying attention and lets say the driveless system stops working and your on your phone and get in a bad car crash. The company would then get sued. The technology has gotten so good these days they are ready to start making these next generation cars. They did put in that the car will watch out for you and go the right speed and take you where you want to but you wil still have to do some little things. The article states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify teh driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" After reading that I would feel pretty confident about getting behind a wheel and letting the car drive for me. I have to admitt that would be pretty cool. I would like to see more people start using them. For istince I have never see one of these cars and I would give it some time for other people to use them just to make sure they are totally safe and I could put my family in one.

The car industry definantly has a bright future ahead of them with all these newer envented cars coming out. Especially this year Tesla is the guinne piq of them all so if things don't go right the other companies can correct the mistake on their own car. It would be cool to drive one in a town or city but I don't know how it would to being on a highway with some driveless people and some actual drivers. It would be hard because if you hit someone in a driverless car is it your fault or do you get mad at the car companie. I think things could really turn into a mess.

Although there are many advantages to these Google self driving cars there are also some things that take away from it's self- driving feature. Google may have found a new mode of transportation, but for the here and now I believe taxi's are for here to stay.

If these are self driving cars why must the driver or rider still be fully aware of the surrounding objects and traffic? If they had to state this why should this be allowed on the streets at all. This is a great idea and it's claims of helping our enviroment by using half the fuel the taxi's use would be a huge technological impact on our entire species' carbon footprint on our planet. But also what Google should deam the most important features of this product is it's saftey to passengers and to the vehicles surrounding it.

Although I do agree with amny this is a great idea and could take over the taxi cab industry in total, I feel this may be for the years down the road. Google shoudl wait ten to fifteen years in order to perfect the tehnology in order to get this self driving car on the roads.

What would it be like with driverless cars? The world today would need something like this because then there wouldnt be any crashes as bad as there is. Yes as of right now why would people want a driverless car that needs a driver still? Well if we put are money and the best people we have one it we will make the would a better place. If we make it so that all us humans would have to do is sit in the passanger seat, we would make it a safer place to walk,driver,ride bike, and/or doanything.

We can make the BMW life savers. We wont have many texting and driving,talking on the cellphones while driving. The driving world as we know it will never be as safe as it will be with driverless cars. Yes not many people could buy it because it cost alot of money but they wont care because those peoples kids can walk the streets anthey wont worrie about the kids getting hit or anything.

When we get driverless cars will there be many car crashes?? The answer to that question is no. With the driverless cars they will have sensors that will make the car brake before hitting the other car there for; it will be much safer with driverless cars. If people think this is a bad idea they are wrong and dont understand how safer this will be for everyone.

I am all for the driverless cars with everything i have. Driverless cars will make the world a much safer place.

2DABE7E4BBED,"Why do we want to have driverless cars? There are still things that the driverless cars cannot do themselves. Are they safe? Are driverless cars good for the people? In this arguement These are some of the quesions I'm going to answer in my opinion.

In the future could cars actually drive themselves? That is a question we cannot answer at this time. Right now cars can drive themselves, but not in every situation. In paragraph 2 of the artical it states "" Google cars aren't truley driverless; they still alert the driver to take over..."" The ""driverless"" cars are not so driverless. They alert you when pulling in and out of driveways, when complicated trafic issues occur, and when there is roadwork. The car will alert you in any situation where human abilities are needed. In some cars they have sensors that can sense when to stop, or if there is something the driver did not see to stop for. In paragraph 4 it states ""... uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rear view window...."" They have the sensors for all different things while the car is in motion. But how does that help the car be driverless?

In some cases the ""driverless"" cars are safe, but remember the car is controlled by a computer. It can still shut down and crash. In paragraph 2 it states ""... cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash..."" What happends when the car reaches one million miles? Would is shut down and crash? We don't know that because the text in the artical doesn't state that. Would someone want to have a car that could drive itself, but the human still had to be aware of the road? What if the car is on the highway and alters the human, but the human is sleeping? What if the human wasn't paying any attention to the road? That is a safety hazard. In paragraph 7 it states ""... the human driver must remian alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" What person is going to pay attention to the road if the car can drive itself? Paragraph 2 also states ""... 2013, BMW ... development of ""Trafic Jam Assistant""... car can handle up to the speeds up to 25 mph."" What person can't drive at 25 mph? Why would these cars be any safer than a regular car?

Why would anyone want ""driverless"" cars if they really can't drive by themselves? Would any human want to wait their turn to drive their car at 25 mph? Would the human driving the car got into an accident and they were not the one driving? New laws would have to be made for those situations. New roads would have to be worked on so that the new ""driverless"" cars could work. Woud anyone go through all of this trouble just so that we could wait our turn to drive our own cars? I don't think anyone would want that. So why do we need driverless cars? Just to be lazy, or to just drive at low speeds? I don't think that I would want to be lazy and drive at 25 mhp for my car to be ""driverless."" Would you?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A62F78D7B7FA,"Are Driverless cars safe for the future?

In the Article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it talks about how driverless cars is not an imagination for the future but how it's coming to a reality and how the idea is coming together. Even the company Google has starteed having cars that drive independently since 2009. But in my opinion, I believe that driverless cars are unsafe and that car companys should stick to manually driven vehicles.

There are reasons that driverless cars are unsafe; they can't drive around complicated trafics issues and navigate through road work, and still need assistance of a human to navigate and drive the car, and repairing the roads to be suitable for these vehicles is costly. How can a car navigate around traffic and know what to do in the situation? The car doesn't have capability of a human mind to work through these problems. In paragraph 7 in the article it staes, "" But all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating work zones and arund accidents."" This proves that these vehicles don't have the capability of human skills and problem solving skills to work around these obstacles.

Another problem with driverless cars is that there still needs to be a human driver on the wheel and to be alert at all times. There is no point on having driverless cars if the car can't succesfully drive itself without a human. These vehicles are still not equiped and aren't safe for the pasangers becuase the driver needs to be alert at all times and wouldn't it get boring not driving but just watching? Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver says, "" The drive psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" If it's really that much of a challenge then it most likely will be impossible to fix this problem.

Lastly, another big downside of driverless cars is repairing the roads to a smart road system to accompany the drivrless cars. These smarter roads will make the cars safer and easier for the cars to navigate throught but it will be costly and every road would have to be repaired. In paragragph 3, Enigeers at Berkley stated, "" These smart-road systems worked suprisungly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This statement shows that these engineers are agreeing that is impossible to rebuild every road to accompany these vehicles for a safe ride.

Driverless cars was an imagination of the past but has started becoming a relaity in our furture. But these cars should stay an imagination and have been proven to not be safe. Driverless cars still need a driver in the seat to take control in complicated siuations and it's too costly. Why have ""driverless cars"" when you still need a driver?

62DE89A7A1EE,"How would you feel if you pulled up to a stoplight, and the person next to you was in the front seat, but wasn't driving? It would seem odd at first, but unfortuantely, there is a very good chance that that is the way things could be in the near future. Personally, I do not think that driverless cars should be invented. However, there are people that think that being able to go somewhere in a car without having to actually drive it would be a great idea. Driverless cars are not a good idea, because the cars may be more expensive since they are driverless, there could be malfunctions since the car would be made of new technology, and the people in the car would have to know when to be paying attention, in case of an emergency.

The first negative effect of having driverless cars, is the fact that the cars would probably be more expensive. Since the technology to make the cars would be expensive, the cars might be expensive themselves. If the cars are too expensive, no one would want to buy them unless they had a lot of money. Also, if not enough people are buying the cars, they might have to get discontinued eventually. If the cars had to get discontinued, everyone who already had one of those cars would be in hot water, becuase car repair people would not be able to fix their cars. This now leads me into my second reason why driverless cars should not be made.

What if the car has malfunctions? If there isn't an actual person driving the car, they won't be able to control the speed. The person will just have to trust the car to drive itself, and hope that it doesn't mess up, and accidently over accelerate and cause an accident. If the car did mess up while driving and caused an accident, someone would have to figure out whose fault it is. The article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" made a good point by mentioning that if there is an accidnet, whose fault would it be - the driver or the company who made the car? There would defintiely be a big legal case to arise considering that the ""driver"" isn't technically driving the car.

The final reason that driverless cars should not be made, is because people would have to be able to learn to control the car. However, a positive thing about having driverless cars is that people would not need to take drivers ed anymore, but with a driverless car, you would still have to learn the ways of road. You would still need to be paying attention on the road. Just because your car would be driverless, doesn't mean that everyone's car would be driverless. For instance, if a wreck occured and you weren't paying attention in your driverless car, you wouldn't know whose fault it was, or if there was a way you could have stopped the wreck from happening. Going back to the text, the article mentions in paragraph seven that ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

To conclude, driverless cars should not be created. Driverless cars is a situation where the bad outweighs the good. There might be some positives to having a driverless car, but driverless cars seems to risky. With accidents happening, because people are not paying attention to their driverless car is not something I want to be involved in. Driverless cars are not the best idea, because they could possibly be more expensive than our regular cars, they could possibly have malfunctions to put the ""driver"" and others at risk, and the ""driver"" may not have to take drivers ed, but they would have to learn how to work their new car, which means that they would need to be paying attention. A driverless car is not something that I would invest in, but I could see them becoming popular in the near future.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A564951E4EC4,"Driverless Cars are usually something we see in movies, specifically in futuristic or sci-fi movies. When we see these movies, we are in awh and we would love to have them. I mean who wouldn't want a car that could drive it self, but is it the best thing for us?

There are companies now that have cars that drive, for exmple Google and BMW. Google has had drvieable cars since 2009 and they have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but there is still a person in there that has to help out. Although the cars do drive them selves, they can not go through work zones or go around crashes, so the human has to come into play. BMW has a car that they call ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", this car can handle driving speeds up to 25 mph, but drivers still need to keep their hands on the wheel and when the car does not know what to do then vibrations go through the seat to notify the driver.

Humans have been driving for many many centuries and to think of a day where we won't have to do that anymore is strange. If humans don't have to drive, then they won't pay attention. If these companies really make a car that drives it's self through any kind of condition then what will happen if the car gets into an accident with another car. Will it be the humans fault or the car and say it is the car's fault, who will we blamn the company for promoting a safe car or the people who designed the car. Something else to look at in the situation is how much will the repairs will be?

In today's day in age when we get into a crash the damage is pretty costly and the hospital bills are not very pretty either. But we are talking about a car that drives itself, so it is going to cast way more to fix. You have to repair the body of the car and the the inside just like you do now but these cars can drive them selves by computers and chips. So how much will they charge us to fix the computer and the body?

In coclusion to my argument, no. I dont think we should keep making and testing these driverless cars. There is so much at risk and Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of drving on autopilot 90% of the time. That is not 100% so why are we still wasting our time and money on this. The cost for repairing these cars if there is a crash will go up and there will be law suits to the companies. These cars will not make it very long on the market, so we should stop now and continue makeing the cars that we have now safer and continue rebuidling and finding more things we can add them.

DE78893DB845,"Throughout time, there have been countless sci-fi films and movies of cars that could drive themselves. However, what may once have seemed like fiction is now becoming a reality. Many companies, like Google, General Motors, and BMW have been working on driverless-car technologies since as early as the late 1950's. Although there are many positive sides to these new technologies, many people fail to realize their potentials and feel as if they are dangerous. This, however, is where they are wrong. Driverless cars are a great idea in new technology because they save on feul and money, they provide people more opportunities, and they make driving safer.

Driverless cars can overall save us on an abundance of gas and money. As stated in the ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" article, Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that his idea of a driverless car public transport system would use half the feul as today's taxis. As our feul is a fossil feul, meaning one day it will run out, using as little of it as possible is much more than just a good thing. Also, using this idea of a driverless car public transport system would save us a lot of money. Not having to drive your own car and fill it up every week would save you quite a bit on gas money. Also, you would not have to pay for repairs or damages to your vehicle.

Driverless car's are not only more efficient and green, they also would provide many more opportunities for people all over the world. Most of the population of the Earth cannot afford the luxury of their own vehicle. Since they do not have their own means of transportation, it is much harder for them to get a job. Of course, in bigger cities, like Chicago or New York, there are taxis, subways, trains, and busses that provide people the means of transportation that they need. However, in smaller cities and poorer countries, there are not any means of public transportation. In my town, for instance, there are not any busses, trains, taxis, Uber Drivers, or Subways. The only way to get from place to place is by your own car, getting a ride from someone else, by bike, or by foot. If we had a driverless car transpotation system in places like this, many people would be provided with many more oppourtunities to be able to travel from place to place.

Lastly, Driverless Car's would prevent many accidents, therefor making driving safer for everyone. Technologies are being created in many types of cars that prevent accidents before they happen. For instance, many cars are now being made with breaks that stop themselves when they sense that the vehicle is in danger of hitting something/someone. Some other companies, like GM, have developed Driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing up into an object so that the driver can take control. Many ""heads-up"" displays like this one are being created to prevent tons of accidents and possible deaths and/or injuries related to driving.

Overall, driverless cars are a safe, efficient, and logical choice for the future of transportation. Driverless cars are a great idea in new technology because they save on feul and money, they provide people with more opportunities, and they make driving safer. With these new technologies, we are slowly making our world into a more efficient and safe place in which to live. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

With technology advancing at rates that it is why are driverless cars so bad to some people when a computer is capable of knowing everything and people seem to be getting less and less smart every day why are driverless cars not an option.

088DE8F54832,"Say No to Driverless Cars

More than 50% of the population in the United States say yes to driverless cars. They want the future to come for them, without even thinking about the effects these cars can leave for them in the future. Driverless cars are a ""cool"" concept that movies introduced to us many years ago, leaving people wandering if it could really happen one day. Now that there is a possiblity that these cars could actually happen, these people are going crazy and supporting this idea. Supporting the development of driverless cars should not happen because of the dangers that can some with them if they were to malfunction, leaving a bigger disaster for us than what we started with.

In the article, it states that driverless cars now, can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but they are designed to notify the driver when it requires human assistance. All cars need human assistance instead of a computer telling it what to do, otherwise it will not be as safe. A person always needs to have eyes on the road, especially if a computer is the one driving because there are possibilities that something could go wrong. Computers do not compare to the human brain, for example there are instances where a person needs to decide what is best to be safe in the road. A computer will not be able to do that because they are programmed and do not have a sense of feeling or emotions.

If there are laws that make even testing computer-driven cars illegal, that states that maybe the whole development of these cars is not a good idea. Laws are there for a reason, and that is to keep the drivers, passangers, and pedestrians safe. Even though there are a few states like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia, that approve the use of semi-autonomous cars, it is only a matter of time before a disaster happens. With computer driven cars, there is no garantee that the people will be safe. Because there is no safe way to know if driverless cars are a good and safe idea, it is better if they are just not produced at all.

The number of technological parts that is used in the Toyota Prius is astonishing! It uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. All of these sensors and parts must be extremely expensive to make and include in the car. Billions and billions of dollars would go into making this possiblitly real. That is not even including the specially designed roads that are going to be needed in order for the driverless cars to even work. The amount of money needed in order to produce these cars is extremely high, and if it will cost a lot to make, the amount of money needed to buy these cars will surely be the same.

Safety should be every drivers first priority. These cars will not provide much safety for anyone on the road. Driverless cars are not even important or necessary, because us humans can drive just fine and not worry about being safe. Peope are just becoming lazier as years go buy and if this continues, before we know it we will be in a bigger problem than what we began with.

69E57CE13181,"By reading ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" I think to myself that they still need improvment. Now cars been around for a long time, but not that long for us to make a car that drives its self. People who drive right now are better off driving themself, I understand they think its cool and it will change the future, but there will be far more accidents then when people regularly drive. They even said that they need improvements such as not being able to go around accidents or off road, and even destruction workers. Now even though it drives its self which is cool you know but how would the car know if there is a stop sign or a red light, there will be an accident.

Now if cars cant see where a stop sign is and if its a red light or yellow light then there is no reason to make a driverless car. Thats like having a blind person walk across the street while they think its their living room. If the human driver has to be alerted if the car does something it was not suppose to do then they should wait 5 to 7 more years until they release it out to the public. Im no science guy or car dude but I know that it would take longer for a car to drive its self. Stick with normal cars.

The year 2020 is not far away in fact theres 4 more years until 2020 is upon us, thats not enough years to find out what is wrong with the car, fix it and find more problems and fix another one. Every car has problems with it but if your more focused on the car driving its self and accidently forget about the other things like the stock and perhaps a screw for the tire then well your screwed. Alot of people mess up on scooters and forget a part or two but thats nothing because they are easy to drive, but forgetting a part for a car, one that drives its self is dangerous for society. I get it we all make mistakes but that is not what people are going to think when one computer car crashes into a tree because it though it was a road. Then boom people say take away driverless cars.

While im on this computer typing i worry about the computer crashing. While i worry about that what do you think people will worry about when they are the road? They will be worried about dying or getting injured from a computer crashing. That gets me to my next topic, say your on a bike riding home and you hear a car right behind you, but you dont know it was a driverless car then the computer crashes and you get injured and you sue the person for not being careful but you should be suing google for not taking more time and making things better. Then google loses everything because they lost the coart battle.

There are planes that the government has been working on for a very long time, and there are still problems with it. I understand nothing is perfect but dont take the chance to make a car to drive its self and when it messes up people blame the company because people look at it like that. They aint use to it. They are use to regular cars that people can drive in. People see crashes all the time because its usually one of the drivers that dont know what they are doing. When they see that it was a driverless car the car is going to get blamed and the people who didnt take their time in their project.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BB86A3A5AFE7,"Driverless cars would be a positive advancement in our modern society because they'll be safe, cheap, and helpful for people.

These high-tech cars, once fully developed, could be much safer than current buses or taxis. Driverless cars would be completly covered in sensors, as stated in chapter 4, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" using Google's mostly-driverless car as an example. These sensors provide a, ""constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" which could be programmed to be much more aware than human eyes. Sensors have been around for a while, and could provide lots of safety once fully developed.

The driverless cars would also be cheaper and more earth-friendly in the long run. In chapter 1, it says, ""The car he (Sergey Brin) foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis..."" which is a big statement. In North America gas prices are constantly fluctuating but are generally considered to be quite high. These cars, using half the gas of current taxis, will be a good deal versus current gas prices. If these cars do become the majority of transportation, some people will also stop buying their own cars, which is a huge investment. Plus, using less gas will lead to a healthier enviornment. Driverless cars will eliminate the hefty gas-usage and large money investments.

Finally, driverless cars will be helpful in their convienience for people. Many people get into car crashes because they aren't paying full attention to the road- they try to do other things while driving. In a driverless car, multitaskers would no longer have to strain focus between their own task and driving, they would be able to focus only on what they wanted to do. Anyone who couldn't pay full attention to the road- due to work needs, an ailment, anything, wouldn't have to worry about the risk of driving without their full attention. The driverless cars would be highly convienient for people.

Driverless cars, though they have a long way to go, would be a good investment for the future. They offer safety in new forms with sensors, are cheaper because of the use of less gas, and will be convienient and helpful to humans. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
0C0A8EBDC931,"I am for driverless cars, because they could be helpful, they seem safe, and they are already being used by Google. They could help people with disabilities that make them unable to drive or go where they need to go.

First of all, they are using sensors in them to help navigate them. They are developing special roads, smart roads. There were test tracks built in the 1950's by General motors. They built a concept car that could run on a special track that was embedded with a electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineers at Berkeley tried something similar. They used magnets with alternating polarity, so the car could read the polarities using the binary code. All of this was proved to be too expensive. They started putting sensors on the cars, postion-estimating sensors, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor.

Second of all, they seemed far away from making a driverless car. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assiatant."" The car would be able to handle driving at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors makes sure the drivers keeps ahold of the wheel. Most of these cars are yet to be fully driverless, they can steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but they all are designed to notify the driver when the rooad ahead requires human skills. Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays would be turned off instantly when the driver needsto take over, this way the in-car system is acctually a safety feature.

Third of all, The only problem is that there are laws prohibiting the uses and testing of driverless cars. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all time. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. Traffic laws will have to change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. Automakers are still continuing with their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

Therefore I am for driverless cars, because they could be helpful, they seem safe, and they are already being used by Google. There's no telling what's to come from the future of driverless cars. ",1,Driverless cars,Text dependent
5ECB1B37A25D,"Evolution is enevitable. Apparently car evolution is aswell. Some of us have dreamed of auto-pilot cars. Either when its snowing outside or just when we feel too tired to drive. Although the thought seems possible, how safe is it? Who will be blamed for hitting the car infront of you? How will it drive on ice?

Most states have made it illegal to have auto-pilot cars on the road. Probably because there are no true laws for non-human driving cars. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fauly-the driver or the manufacturer?"" The manufacturer is the one who designed the car and the 'driver' isnt in control of the vehicle. It is highly likily that the maufacturer will be at fault. This being so they will have to pay insurance on thousands of accidents. If an error occurs with a batch of cars and they all cause accidents they will probably go bankrupt or lose more money than they are earning.

No one wants to be injured going to work or on a family vacation. What if a auto-pilot car crashed into your car because their sensors went out? Likily the car will tell you when the sensors are dying, and that will cost alot to replace. ""The infromation from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" In theory, this sounds great. Something is sure to go wrong though. Most cars already have recalls every week on seats or air bags. What if you get a recall saying your google car has a sensor issue? That sensors fail or don't sense far enough ahead to stop in time?

Most cars already have cruise control, a setting that maintains your speed without pressing the gas pedal. Even though you need to steer still, you are mostly assisting the car. ""Google cars aren't truely driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" One would wonder if a sensor cant detect cars while pulling out, atleast yet, will they ever be able to?

If these auto-pilot cars can not navigate roadwork through GPS they likily will never be able to get around without information telling the GPS system that. Cars will mostlikily never be totally driverless.

All in all, these cars will probably be more than cars are now. These cars will probably never be one-hundred percent auto-pilot. Manufaturers will lose more money when a product malfunctions than earn. There are more problems to go wrong with these cars than with normal ones to begin with. Cars should be only driven by capable humans. We are already beginning to be a very lazy society and need to be more handy and independent. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A4E6318615AE,"The question is how do I feel about driverless cars? I'm going to tell you why I think it's a bad idea to have driverless cars. In my story i'm going to tell you why I don't like the idea, why a homan should always be controlling the car, and the consequences of a driverless car that could happen.

The reason I don't like the idea of a driverless car is there are so much money going to be wasted. Thousands of dollars wasted if all of a sudden your car is smashed. So many peoples lives will be at risk if they don't have a driverless car. How can you even feel comfortable knowing that you can kill somebody? In my opinion I don't like the idea of letting the car control my movements and the car makes a noticeable noise or sound that alerts me. I know some people would even fall asleep at the wheel. What if all of a sudden your car doesn't make that noise or sound without you noticing? I'll rather just control the car myself rather than letting it control me.

In my opinion I think that humans should always be at the wheel controlling it. It lets you control your actions not letting a computerized vehicle do it. What if you do get in a crash at least you know your at fault not the vehicle. Wouldn't humans get bored just sitting their? I know that some humans might fall asleep at the wheel and that can lead to a lot more problems. This is why I believe humans should control the car.

Lets talk about the consequences of a driverless car. Some consequences of a driverless car is injuries. No one wants to get hurt say your car loses signal and you fell aslepp and hurt yourself. Another consequence is if you hurt or even possibly kill someone else. That'll ruin someone's feelings of a driverless cars. The last consequence I can tell you but certainly not the only ones out there is possibly killing yourself. That can hurt so many feeling in your family. How would you think your family would feel if they said my ""cousin"" died from a computerized vehicle? That'll be the last thing I would expect at least right now in 2016.

There are a lot of more reasons why I think driverless cars are a bad thing. Just think about it me and you might think the same things. So I told you the reasons why I think driverless cars are a bad thing, why humans should always be controlling the car, and some consequences of a driverless cars. Not saying this could affect you personally, but I think this could hurt a lot of people in the long run.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
48FC1978FC12,"The develpoement of driverless cars is unrealistic to me in many different ways. Due to the fact that just one car will need an incredible amount of technology to keep the car itself as safe as possible means that the car will be overly priced. Not only will It be over priced, but the fact that people are going through so much money to make a car that is able to be on ""auto pilot"" shows laziness.

A brand new, average car could cost to about 20,000 dollars. When they add on technology to ensure the saftey of the driver and everyone in the car, the prices of cars will become too expensive for most people, ""For starters, they need a whole lot of sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mountes near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an interial motion sensor."" People will begin to realize that it would only be avaliabe to wealthier people who can pay for an extremly expensive car that will only benifit them in one way. Them being able to have transportation of their own that they do not have to control means that they would more than likely not be paying attention to the road.

The idea of having a vehicle that you do not have to manage while on the roads sounds amazing to everyone. What happens when one or two of the sensors corrupt and the car steers off into the other lane? What if the motion sensor malfunctions while backing out of a driveway and a pedestrian is taking a jog and doesn't see the car backing out? There is no way that the driverless car could be 100% safe at all times. It dangerous to even think about how the car could have a mind of its own while on the highway,""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufacturer?""

Transporting from place to place withought having to put your foot on the gas or making sure you remember to put on your turning signals sounds like a great and easy way to go places. Once the driverless car has been out for years and people begin to start using them often, the commubity will get lazy and irresponsible. No one will ever think they will have to drive themselves because they think that the cars will last forever and that they will just get better from the start, Theyre, wrong. The car could end having difficulties after a few years and they will shut down the production of the cars and people will be too lazy to drive themselces around. People will end up being dependent on the cars to do all of the ""hard work"" for them.

In essence, the develpomement of driverless cars is unreliable and should not be procceded with. The technology will raise the prices of the cars and make it impossible to purchase without a problem, it's too much of a risk for wrecks to happen due to failing sensors, and people will begin to rely on the car after awhile.

33FFF620DDD8,"Cars were invented by Harrison Ford to allow humans to have easier and safer access to transportation.

Cars and automotive vehicles were designed to enhance safety and allow passangers to efficiently arrive to their destination.

Cars were engineered to be driven, powered, and handled by humans, not to be self automated devices.

Humans as a whole should not have automated cars. Having a trasnportation vehicle that is soley reliant on detectors is not a safe way to travel from place to place. Whether the distance is near or far, accidents are always prone to happen, and those chances only increase with a human not in complete control behind the wheel. The article states that ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires,"" but can this really be achieved when the driver has the ability to become more distracted, stop paying attention, or even fall asleep when the car is being dirven for them? Having a self driven car allows many more opportunities to be distracted while on the road, and it is not garunteed that the driver will immediatley snap back into attention when human control is needed. If the car is unable to handle itself in dangerous or unknown situations, should people really be letting the car drive on a road where there are many unpredictable factors? The article says ""flashing lights"" and ""vibrating seats"" will notify the driver when danger is near, but this is simply not an efficient or probable solution if the driver were to be asleep or distracted, which would give anyone a slow reaction time. ""...safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" Haveing a self driven car would simply make the driver much too reliant on the vehicle they are in.

The world is becoming too dependent on technology, and if we allow ourselves to be driven by an object that was invented for us to drive, we are only furthering this conflict.

Becoming too dependent on technology has made us oblivious to the world around us, so just think how worse that could be if we allow cars that give us room to be side tracked while on the road with a countless number of individuals. If automated cars become a reality for everyone, what other things will we let do the simplest things we can do ourselves? The text states ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" This statement simply is not true in the context of self driven cars. We will still have cars, we will just fail to know how to use them ourselves.

Cars are a widely used object world wide, but not everyone can afford them. The cars we have today are expensive, so what will the cost of a new, self driven car will be? If the goal is to ""...release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time"" becomes reality, there will only be a select demographic of people who will be able to afford these cars. The more cars companies and manufacturers make and the less cars people are able to buy, the more in debt these companies will be in. Neither party will be benefiting from self driven cars.

Some individuals would argue that we as a society and race need to push ourselves forward and take advantage of the new technology being invented so we can take the next step into achieving greatness. This is a very broad notion that can only pertain to certain inventions and situations, the automated car not being one of them. Allowing all technology and inventions to take over our lives will only result in the lack of knowledge of how to take care of ourselves and the people that surround us.

We need to learn to become more independent on the things that are handed to us in order to keep the humanity we have. This is what seperates the living beings from the computers we come in contact with everyday. Others would even argue that the self driven car is safer to handle and will enhance the protection of others, but how can this be true if faulty technology is inevitable? Faulty technology will also result in confusing and frustrating lawsuits, as demonstrated in the article. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""

We simply cannot rely on computers to do all our work for us, it is impractical.

In conclusion, having self driven cars would only hinder our development as a society and lead us further into a future where independence of technology is greater than what anyone can handle, and will ultimatley lead to the decimation of the individuality of humans.",6,Driverless cars,Text dependent
31EBF68660C1,"Driverless cars have many good thing going for them, but there need to be a line drawn when it come to the safety of our family and friends. Google's effort's to make a driverless car is very interesting, but we need more time to explore the field before it is available to the public. The article states that their are waiting on the law, manufacturing, and the technology/safety for everyone to create a driverless car. We must wait for all of these thing to be finalized before it is in the hands of the public.

The article states that it is ""Waiting on the Law"" to make sure there is liabilty in the case there is an accident with this robot-like car. This is going to raise all kinds of problem involving the manufacturer and the driver. The best way to control these types of problems from occuring is to just stopping the idea of driverless cars. Although, we cannot stop the idea of driverless car we can control who gets to use them. I think the the traffic law is just the beginning of new laws involving driverless car. The only thing that is needed is time and time is what they should be getting.

The manufacturating process in driverless car is very new. This comes from the beginning of the article when ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under conditions since 2009."" Well it is 2016 and there are still laws (specific conditions) that needed to be in place and the manufacturating is can still be updated before it is release to the public. Also there are not yet completely driverless car. The company incharge of driverless car should go the completely mile instead of stop half way. The manufactoring still needs to make the car safe for people to driver in. The new sensors for the car were able to become more advance in a decade. The sensors could be more advance if we wait and the laws for the car will be ready by then.

The most part of not have driverless car and waiting is to increase our safety. We need more time for the technology to beccome advance. Our safety is more important and robot car can be flawed. There should not be any problems with the car when it is released to the public. A robot-like car needs more time to be reviewed by the government and other assoications. Safety for our family and friends is more important.

The idea of driverless car is interesting, but there are still some unanswerable questions that needed to be answered before there are in the publics hands.

8AE833D4B9F8,"Driverless Cars: Where are They?

Driverless cars, a dream many people have had ever since they heard of the idea. A world where you don't have pay as much attention to the road as you usually have to while driving a normal car, is such an absolutely fantastic idea and one I can't belive that nobody has invented before. Now I'm well aware that there are many skeptics out there that do not support the idea that driverless cars would be a good thing, but I feel that having modes of transportation where you don't have to constantly be alert of your surroundings and have a miniscule posibility of causing acidents is the perfect mode of transportation.

The first reason I suppot the development of driverless cars is the decreased likelyhood of accidents. Hundreds of people die every year due to car accidents and rekless driving. If those numbers can drop at a substancial rate with driverless cars, then thats a beautiful thing. Lives can be saved and a lot of people would be saved a lot of heartache.

Being able to focus on other things while being in the driver's seat of a car would be a great thing for many busy people on the move. Dealing with work while on the move would be a great thing for many people who have to take phone calls from clients while in the car. Being able to use a phone and not have to worry about getting in an accident would be the most wonderful feature any car could ever have.

Doing things in the car would be great, but I'm so glad that people would still have some control in their vehicles. The safety features presented in the artice state that if there is road work going on in the surrounding area the car would alert the driver, and the driver can take immediate control of the vehicle at any time. This safety feature is ingenious as it makes the driver aware of any road blocks or hazzards that may present themselves on the road at any given time.

Driverless cars are a creation that has taken way to long to make. I'm really wondering if they had just been lazy and just now started to to work an them. Cars that are completely safe and self aware of it's surroundings will be amazing. The pros of driverless cars far outway those of the cons, whatever those are.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

If we're going to do it we might as well just do it already, no arguments for or against it. In the future, we have to make sure they are very safe and trustful. It could lead to a lot of angry people wanting their money back or it could lead to a lot of happy people wishing they had another one. Driverless cars can help a lot of people through things, I know drunk driving is very unsafe and if somebody who is intoxicated were to get in a car, it might aswell drive them itself, because chances are, if that person drives it him or her self they'd be endangering everyone around them. With the driverless cars it'd be way more safe on the roads throughout the night, and even the day. They're too many accidents just in traffic and if the driverless cars were smart enough to be able to sense how to work in traffic it'd be perfect! I can see it now, everyone is safe and cars are just moving along smoothly, not that they don't know but there is always that chance for an accident. Also, people with disabilities who may not be able to drive, they just physically can't, driverless cras would be an amazing idea for the. Now, I know this won't happen for another couple of years or so but it's more than likely that driverless cars would take over everyone's regular cars. That could be a good thing though. For one, like i've already stated it'd make sense for people with disabilities and intoxicated people. For two, it's probably the safest thing i've ever heard of when it comes to cars and driving. Some people still like to drive their own cars, oh well they can still do that, but people who cannot drive at all really deserve to be able to get out of the house and be able to get what they need. Especially, the drunk driving that happens pretty much every day here in America, we need a safer way to be on the streets and I think this is it. Too many people are being killed by drunk drivers and if they just didn't have to drive to get home, if only something could just take them home instead, therefore everyone would be safer, driverless cars could make America so much safer in that aspect. You have to really think about how much safer we would all be if driverless cars continue to evolve and progress. I personally, believe that we'd all be in a safer place, it's hard to even go out at night and not see a drunk driver. That's a very big and important reason why driverless cars would be great for us. Another reason, my mom works third shift hours at a hospital. She drives home in the morning very tired. Imagine if she falls asleep while driving, well it'd make her and I both more comfortable knowing that she wouldn't have to drive herself home when she is that tired. It'd just be so much more safe everywhere and all the time. It's make everyone not worry about whther or not they or their family and friends will be in an accident.

First reason is because what happen when ur in the car and when its driving it self down the road you may what to take a nap and your by yourself. Then whe nthe car is driving and it makes a mishap then your in trouble because its your car and you have to pay for it to get fix.

What happens and the car gose to fast or to slow and since you have no control of what the car dose then it stil your fault to be in a crash with another car or in the ditch.

Using a type of car can actaully be dangerous not only to teens but every for old people, they like the old fashion way of driving a car.

It would be way to much to drive a different car that has a whole bunch of new technology that wouldn't make them comfortable nor would they probably feel safe. Older lady's sometimes go out by themselves and just getting into a car like one today is somethimes hard becuase they could have some problems and that they have to take treatment for or they just in general aren't able to move fast enough.

Sensors in the cars could sometime be damaged or every ruined by rain or if the batter dies out on someone in the car. How would you be able to apply breaks on the car if you don't know if the car if front of you is gonna stop, will there be another sensor so you can see the car in front so the car knows. The car will basically be a computer working for you and then what if you're not sure if you could every be able to drive agin, you won't feel the need to because of these drivelss cars.

In conclusion, driveless care aren't a good way to make new cars. The ones today are fine, yeah they may be old but why make it easier on adults and teens that like the new technology and like the idea of something with a new type of car. Elderly and teens don't need to be driving driveless cars because it just wouldn't be safe with buliding new technology and making it harder to control and not knowing what to do if there was an accident.

439F5C311FE2,"Google has always been there for us when we need a fantastic search engine or when we need to figure out what special holiday it is, but little did we know about there lastest invention! Google has been seeking for a better technological future since 2009 with there latest peice; the smart vehicle. Although, this great thought has come to life for the world to visualize, I don't really believe that this invention is as great as the world may see it to be.

For a place which is already called ""Lazy America"", why would this nation want to progress the other lands thoughts on that belief? The fact that there are cars being made for the laziest of people who don't have the moments of time or ability to sit and drive to go from one place to another is upsetting. These cars are being made for the people who rather text, eat, (etc.) and drive than pay attention to the road. Google had mentioned that their cars must have ""the human driver..remain alert and be ready to take over.."", but Google is trying to get around that problem so the car is totally self-operated. Not only Google, but many other vehicle companies. For example, in paragraph ten, it states that the ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drives themselves by 2020."" What does this prove? Does this show that America's self worth is our inventions? No, I believe that this shows how unbelievably lazy this world has become.

Secondly, Although this autopilot car may caught the heart and the eyes of everyone who has heard about this invention, I'm positive that these cars could not be afforable to the people who want them most. Because of the amount of time and money that it took to research how to make these cars, it would cost lots of money to replenish those funds and there is only one way of doing that for those vehicle companies and for Google; selling their cars for higher prices. For this reasoning, many of the lower classes and comfortably living middle classes would not be able to pay for the cars. In paragraph one, it talks about how ""the car he{Sergey Brin} foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis.."" and cars, which is good for our planet and good for the ozone, but if the only people who have these cars are the rich, which is low in numbers of people as a whole, what difference would it make if the many people who cannot afford these smart cars are still giving off these gas fumes and pollution into the air? Many people think about how this will affect the human race and how great of an invention this is. Yes, this invention may have its perks, but it wouldn't make a difference for those who cannot afford the first downpayment of these cars.

Lastly, the amount of regulations and laws that have to be overturn would take many, many years for these cars to even be legal to drive in many parts of the world! ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" I firmly believe in this. They say this because when a human driver is always operating the vehicle, they are forced to pay attention for the sake of their lives or others.

The narrator of this article that ""..special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel"" at all times, but even if the human driver is holding on and behind the wheel that does not mean that they are paying attention 100% percent to the road ahead of them, which happens to be a scary thought. Many people fall asleep behind the wheel when the car is fully operated by them alone, so this would not stop many people from falling asleep.. Especially if they don't have to do anything to drive! If those many alert sensors do not alert the sleeping person, that may be trouble. Getting that passed through traffic laws would be difficult; Even for Google!

Although Google has been there for us for about a good decade and a half, helping us with our internet needs, that doesn't mean that they need to continue to move forward with something like this. The smart car, may be a pretty new thing to gaze and gauke at, but is it safe for our everyday use? Would it be safe for our newly founded driving teenagers, who already text and drive? Teaching people that it's okay to be lazy and not pay attention to the road is not something I would want to support and I believe that many people should stand behind this thought. I say ""No"" to this contraption.",6,Driverless cars,Text dependent

F1A0D1F81017,"Driverless cars seem like an impossibility.

They seem like something out of a futuristic movie or comic book.

However, today's evidence proves that driverless cars are a realistic possibility.

Advancements in technology today provide tangible evidence that driverless cars could play a prominent role in the near future.

Driverless cars should be developed and dissimenated because they are more efficient, would increase safety, and would increase the quality of life for drivers.

Driverless cars are much more efficient.

The article ""Driverless cars are coming"" states, ""The cars [Google cofounder Sergey Brin] foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

Obviously, driverless cars would increase the efficiency of vehicles and use half as much fuel.

This would benefit both the owner of the car and the environment.

Pollution from cars is a real problem and, if cars only used half of the fuel, then this terrible pollution would be minimized.

Also, if the cars use half as much fuel, then our natural resources would be preserved and the cost of driving a car would be lessened.

Also, Driverless cars are safe.

The biggest problem with driverless cars is that it is difficult to enable them to manuever around unexpected problems like car accidents or construction areas.

However, driverless cars are now able to notify the driver when he or she needs to take over the controls in trecherous situations. This ability to notify the driver when needed will make driverless cars much safer.

If the car is unable to manuever through a situation safely, it will force the driver to take over.

This nullifys the arguement that driverless cars are not safe because it proves that driverless cars notify the driver at any unsafe moment and enable the driver to take over the controls of the car.

Otherwize, the driverless car can handle the terrain on its own.

Finally, driverless cars would increase the quality of life for the driver.

In tedious situations like a traffic jam, driving is boring and energy wasting.

However, driverless cars can take away the exhausting driving experience and allow the driver to relax.

For example, ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" will be very helpful to anyone in a traffic jam because it would take away the boredom of driving in a traffic jam.

Traffic Jam Assistant enables the car to handle driving functions up to 25 miles per hour.

This would be very helpful in a long and tedious traffic jam because one does not drive over 25 miles per hour in a traffic jam.

Also, if taxis could be driverless cars, the quality of life for the average citizen would increase.

Taxis would cost less money, they would be open more often, and they could take passengers to farther destinations.

This would dramatically increase the quality of life for all people and it would make owning a car almost antiquated.

this would provide much finacianal saving for the average person and it would provide a great deal of convinience for the average person as well.

In conclusion,

Driverless cars would be extremely beneficial.

They would increase efficiency, increase safety, and improve the quality of life for all people.

Driverless cars would drastically change the way people live.

If cars could drive themslelves, the quality of life would be incredibly increased for all people and the world would not be the same.  ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

The reason why I say dirveless cars are not the smartest idea is because if you have driveless cars everywhere there would be a higher chance of getting into an acccident than just you driving the car. This would likely happen because what happens if the system malfunctions on you and you are just there driving not knowing that the system isn't working, and then before you know BANG you hit another car.

Now, some people are saying ""well in the article it says that you need to be aware of you enviroment"" which in other words you need to know what is going on outside of your car. But, lets be real most people now and days don't really look at the road. They are texting or doing something while not looking on the road. So, what I am trying to say is driveless cars are not woth the wait nor the money. Most people in this world will probably be doing the same exact thing when you are the one drive the car.

C1F21F7AD52C,"Driverless cars are more of a reality than we think. With all of the new technologies advances in cars, driverless cars aren't just a dream anymore. Although driverless cars can be beneficial, there are just too many risks and consequences for them to be assist with everyday life in a positive way.

Technology is one of the greatest risks with driverless cars. Once driverless cars are available to the public, there are many things that could go wrong. Fluxes in weather could cause major issues within the driverless cars that would have very expensive repairs. Remodeling streets to incorporate driverless cars would be ""simply too expensive to be practical"" [3]. Car thiefs now only have to hack into cars to steal them. If the technology within the car fails, are all of the passengers stranded? Malfunctions can also cause accidents killing passengers and pedestrians nearby.

The next question is, ""if technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver of the manufacturer?"" [9]. There will be countless driverless car court cases to decide if the passengers were at fault, or if the technology was to blame. There are more serious court cases to deal with than a surplus of citizens verus technology. Also with their steady supply of resources such as good lawyers, companies have a solid chance at winning majority of these cases and not having to own up to their mistakes. As a result of this, innocent citizens now have to pay these have fees that could ruin their lives.

01604A97F0C3,"Every person needs some form of transportation.

For most people that form of transportation is a car.

Cars are used not only as transportation but are also used for recreation and competiton.

Self-driving cars may take away from the recreation and competition parts and make the hobbies of many people become non-existant.

One could argue that roads would be safer with cars capable of driving themselves, but the reality is a computer is no replacement for a human brain.

A computer with all the little circuts and fuzes it has is not able to make a decision that solves problems beyond the one it is currently faced with.

Therefore car accidents will stil loccur and when an accident does occur who is to be held accountable?

Who wil pay the cost o fthe damage? ""Who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?""(paragragh 9)

One cannot simply say that the the dumbest car is the one to blame.

Nor can he or she say that the drivers are at fault if they had no control over their car.

Driving can also be used as an escape.

Some people race their cars as a hobby and others just enjoy a nice Sunday cruise around town.

Either way they are not driving so they will not find the refuge from day-to-day life they seek.

What would be the fun of going to a track and sitting in a car you love and then have it drive itself around the track.

Pushing a car ro its max and diving into corners and accelerating out of them is what makes driving fun.

Without the roar of an engine reving at eight thousand RPM and the squeal of tires barely golding on to asphalt what would racing a car be?

A major issue with autonomous cars would be that of cost.

As the founder of the Google Car Project said ""Radar was a device at the top of a hill that costs two hundred million dollars.

It wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack.""

The U.S. cannot afford a road system that will put us deeper into the sixteen trillion dollar hole we are in.

The price of cars would also rise making them for only people who could afford them.

A car with a higher price tag means a smaller market will be able to purchase them and less money is to be made.

Less money made means less money spent by the employees and that will make the economy worse.

Creating cars that drive themselves will take away from the hobbies of many people.

B760F98AB4A8,"Driverless cars. An innovation that was once only a dream is now much closer to being a significant aspect of our lives. Personally, I am all for the development of driverless cars. The pros severely outweigh the few cons and there really aren't many valid reasons to halt working on driverless cars.

According to cofounder of multi-billion dollar company google, Sergey Brin, we could create a future of public transport that consists completely of driverless cars. Also, this solution would use only half of the fuel that today's taxis use. If fuel is being reduced and citizens are easily able to get from point A to point B, the only con here is that there would be less jobs available for transport such as taxi drivers. But proportionally, using half the fuel we do now would have a much stronger positive impact on our future than careers being lost for the miniscule fraction of people who work as a taxi driver.

At the moment, car crashes are one of the highest likely reasons of death ESPECIALLY in teens. And this doesn't show any reason to change. But in a handful of years when driverless cars are close to perfection, the amount of car crashes that would occur would drop drastically. That is, if we take advantage of an opportunity like this rather than sleeping on it for what little reason there is left. Once the driverless cars are improved enough and safer than the average driver, we will be able to make the majority of transport used with them. And then there will be no more reasons to worry about new teen drivers getting in a wreck, drunk drivers, drivers under the influence, etc.

Lastly, new drivers will have lots of time saved once driverless cars are everywhere. New drivers currently have to spend at least 50 hours driving with a parent or guardian before they are considered ready to drive alone (and let's not forget that new drivers have a 50% chance to be involved with a crash during their first year of driving with a license). So driverless cars will free up time for families with new or inexperienced drivers as well as save them money. Most new drivers take a driver's ed class (which first of all takes a lot of time) and they can be hundreds of dollars! There's no reason we shouldn't eliminate these pointless negative aspects of our current system.

Reviewing what's been said here, three significant reasons driverless cars should continue being worked on are apparent. One being that only HALF the fuel we currently use would be needed. Two: having these driverless cars would create a much safer environment since crash rates would nearly disappear. And finally, new drivers would save large amounts of time and money once these cars are here and ready. These are only three reasons of countless others that haven't been addressed yet.

But we never really know until we take a full look into the research for this idea that they have for us. Google cofounder Sergey thinks this plan will work out. We'll end up seeing whether that is true or not.

As I see yes these cars are working by themselves and showing alot of positive things. But how can we insure for sure that it wont be that expensive we need more facts for that. The car will tell the driver when the driver has to move it by vibrating the drivers seat or some kind of signal. What if there are malfuctions to this process and it doesnt alert the driver. Yes the driver should already be alert just in case but we all have flaws that sometimes we space out.

It does seem like they are off to a good start with idea for ""Driverless cars"" but they need to have some facts,more percentages of how they know they wil be right that this will be a postive thing.

People now a days text and drive all the time and do not pay attention to yield signs or even the speed limit. Being in a car that you do not have to drive will give people the bad habit of not paying any attention to the road or things around them. With a car driving on its own they wont think it is neccessary. I say it is not a good idea at all to start such a bad habit.

Although people may think it is a good idea to have driverless cars on the roads, I disagree. They say that the car can steer itself and ecelerate and slow down but what about all of the other things. There are multiple different things a car must do on the road that technology can not take over. Such as getting onto a highway or passing another car. How would a car know how to move left the back over right or if a car was coming from another direction. Technology may be upgrading but i think that it is not smart enough yet to control a car and get a passenger safely to their destination.

Lastly, driving a car is a huge task and priveledge. Their are many different rules in driving such as no texting while driving and you must wear a seatbelt at all times. A driverless car is way too dangerous for teeneagers or even adults for that matter.

C39DDF4DF1F1,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are positive and negative aspects of the driverless cars. The driverless cars would use half the gas that the majority of taxis use today. As stated in paragraph 1, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" These cars do have the potential to change the world we know today. The positives are powerful enough to rule out the negatives that come with the driverless cars.

A driverless car would need a lot of sensors and sensors are things that are not so new in the world we live in today. Although they may not be so new, they have become more advanced as the years have passed. These sensors can alert the car when to apply breaks on the wheels and stop acceleration of the engine. This would give a driverless care far better control than a human driver could do by oneslef. As stated in paragraph 5, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had beome more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" Sensors are a big part of making driverless cars have more control than a human would.

Although the pros outweigh the cons, there are some concerns when it comes to these driverless cars. In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Manufactures are trying to prove that driverless cars can be safe and once they have proven this, they will allow these driverless cars. As stated in paragrph 9, ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is simply stating that if there were to be an accident with a driverless car who would be to blame? Would it be the one who made the driverless car or the person behind the wheel? In a case similar to this, like stated before, manufactures are trying to make them far more reliable and safe to use.

There is a car that is being developed by BMW called ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" the car can handle driving functions. Functions such as speeds up tp 25 miles per hour and special sensors on the wheel to make sure to whoever is in the drivers seat keeps ahold of the wheel. The majority of the cars made so far are not completely driverless persay. Drivers can streer, go faster, and slow down by pressing on breaks. These cars are made to alert the driver if on the road ahead of them they would need human skills. They have developed a driver seat that vibrates when the car is in danger of backing into something. These types of things would keep the driver alert to when the car would need their assistance. The manufactures would also add more things to keep the so called, ""driver"" to pay attention. As stated in paragraph 7, ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remainig focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" This is stating that the driver must always be watching the road. The camera that would be installed would be a safety feature, so if the driver isn't paying any attention, the car would alert the driver to.

When it comes to driverless cars there are some worries about them, but they are being tested and going to become reliable cars. The main key is that these cars are safe to use and are made with reasons like this. As stated in paragraph 8, ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.""

This states that the cars are safe for only a period of time. An all computerized car is just asking for the worse when it gets older.

Driverless cars aren't even really driverless, so what's the point? ""But so far, Google cars aren't truely driverless."" The idea of a driverless car may put a person to ease, to where they aren't paying attention to the road ahead. The at ease person may become stressed when the car signals to take over. They might not even be ready to take over the wheel. This is a risky thing when coming to complicated traffic issues.

These driverless cars also seem to be very expensive, something not the everyday person could afford. The car has even been know to be to costly without the price of the car itself.

It says that the cars can steer,accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.

Other reasons why i am againest the driverless cars is because all the cars the world has made what are they going to do with them. If they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are no longer going to be in use. That's going to be a lot of money people have wasted on a car that no one is using anymore.

So this is it my final thoughts on the driverless cars. I say they should not make these cars because they are going to be a waste on money. Instead of using the driverless cars we can use the money on many more important things that the world needs.

At the same time, it is also no surprise that there are hurdles that must be jumped over in order to devleop these machines.

In spite of the roadblocks the development process may encounter, it is important that self-driving cars become a reality.

When thinking about inventions, one must think, why are these things invented in the first place?

The answer is simple: convenience.

For almost any invention that can be thought of, it can be concluded that the main purpose of the invention is to make our lives easier.

The car is a percect example of this. It makes long distance travel easier and much quicker than on foot or by horse.

However, the act of driving a car is a dangerous one.

A person is basically driving a 2,000 pound hunk of metal that is hurdling at fast speeds down a road.

Frankly, there is nothing safe about that idea.

However, if cars were self-automated, automobile travel would be much safer, as it takes the human error out of the equation, reducing accidents and mishaps on the road.

Though the car would be self-driving, a human would be needed in case of an emergency situation, in which the car would not be able to function properly.

As stated in the 7th paragraph of the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" , BMW has already tried its hand at self-automated cars, and have developed a system in which the car drives itself, but requires a person's hands to be on the wheel at all times, in case of an emergency.

This way, the driver would not be totally at the mercy of the computer system in the car in the time of emergency where human intervention is necessary.

Some may say that if self-driving cars were to be a common finding in life, roads and driving laws would need to be changed considerably.

For example, in most states (save for California, Nevada, Florida, and Washington D.C.), testing self-driving cars is not even legal.

These people are right, but it is not a reason to deter the development of these machines.

When the automobile first came to market at the turn of the 20th century, roads fit for automobile travel and driving laws in general did not exist, as there had not been cars before that.

Nowadays, we have highly sophisticated driving laws and road systems.

This shows that it is not impossible to create new laws to deal with new technology as it is invented, and subsequently integrated into modern society.

Car companies such as Tesla, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz have plans to release self-driving cars in the future. However, it is important that the development of self-driving cars continues, as it is a vital and necessary step in technological progression that should occur.

Not only would it make driving a safer and less stressful act, it is just a logical progression as far as technology and innovation is concerned.

It would usher in a new era of innovation, that could only make our lives better.

After all, is that not the point of any invention?",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
8BDC6E007A5D,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future that are becoming more and more present in our lives. Driverless cars are an advancement of our regular manual cars and allows the car to do the manual work the driver would usually do. Driverless cars are becoming more and more talked about as they become more of a possibility for the regular person, but are they really safe for the road. No, they need more testing and certification before they're allowed on the streets. In this essay the problems with the cars technology and other aspects will be dealt with.

Driverless cars shoud be kept off the streets for matters of safety. These cars are new and people don't have much knowledge on them so the risk of a manufacture problem with the computer is very possible. Driverless cars would also make it easier to get away with illegal acts. Thes acts include driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, texting and driving, and much more. With these on the road people's lives and health would be on the line. even as technology advances, it can't advance the human mind. If the car is unable to control it's self anymore and the driver is not fit to drive a lot of problems are going to occur. Also if the car has a malfunction and an accident occurs who recieves the blame the driver or the manufacture? Self driving cars are just a problem waiting to happen. People around the world would feel safer with the manual cars they're used to than cars that aren't very well known and have the possibilty to malfunction at any given time. Technology should be more focused on creating cures for diseases and doing things to help the the people in the world, rather than assisting the fat and lazy in getting around without doing any work at all. Also these cars will cost much more to manufacture and sell at higher prices than manual cars, so what regular person would buy a very expensive car just because it can drive itself, something these people already know how to do and can do for less money?

Self driving cars shouldn't be street legal for many obvious reasons. They're more of a problem than they're worth, and need to be tested more before they're certified for the roads. For now there are just too many underlying problems for these cars to work. We should just stick to what we know, manualy driven cars. As the future comes maybe these cars will become a possibilty, but for now they need to keep testing these cars and sorting out the kinks before they allow people to drive them on the streets.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9E181C2DF75A,"Driverless cars are accomplishing many goals and it won't be to long until they will be in full function.

As a part of this I think that it is time to accept change.

The cars will have a few bugs at the start but won't be a problem for long term.

Automated cars should be able to be developed because of the tests that have positive results, the improvement in sensors, and the safety backing them up.

Cars can be very dangerous, escpecially if you put a computer behind it.

However the smart cars from Google had been driven a half a million miles without a crash.

This result shows how advanced technology has become and how it can be very realiable.

With more tests showing positive results it should be no problem for people to see that the cars are really something special.

Another reason for automated cars to be developed is because of the improvement in sensors.

Now that sensors can be very realiable and are getting cheaper and cheaper it wasn't a bad thought to use them in cars.

Many sensors that are put on the car are used for different purposes.

Some sensors are so improved that they keep a 3-D model of the car's surrounding.

This is important because it will be able to detect when danger is near.

Finally, the last reason automated cars should be developed is because of the safety that will be involved with it.

The automated cars will have key safety features to keep the driver and everyone around them safe.

One of these features is to tell the driver when to take over. Others include stopping when closing in on an object and turning off displays when the driver has to take control.

Will automated cars be developed?

I think they will but only if we let improvement happen.

Automated cars do seem a little fetched out but its important to see the positives.

With all the results from tests, advances in sensors, and key safety features automated cars would be a huge improvement that might just be safer than actual drivers.   ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
C492123F426E,"Driverless cars, although dangerous in a multitude of ways, have uses that far excede any dangers. It is said that in order to progress in life you must first take steps back. Although these driverless cars are a step forward in technology, they can be seen as a being a step backward because of the dangers that persist. In reality, these dangers are just a learning curve to arguably one of the most revolutionary inventions in the last decade, driverless cars. These cars are very fesable because they are sought after, the technology is available, and they are getting safer with time.

These driveress cars are some of the most sought after technology that has entered this world. The human has drempt of the flying car for generations, and finaly the idea is fesable. The text referances Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and how he ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system,"" (Paragraph 1). Although this is just the dream of one man, millions more people believe that driverless cars are the key to the future. These millions of other people have drempt for driverless cars, and many times their fathers did also. Knowing this, many people will want to get their hands on this new technology that is a driverless car. Making the development of these cars very positive becasue the population will want and has wanted driverless cars for decades. Driverless cars have been a thing of fiction for so many people for so long, but now these cars are a reality.

Not only are they sought after by millions, but the technology for these driverless cars is available and has been available. Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars.

The one thing that people can control about these cars is their safety. This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive.

The development of these driverless cars should be continued because they are sought after by many people, the technology is available and is being worked on, and these cars are safe and getting safer. By developing these tests, the companies are creating a technology that, to millions of people, is still only a dream. The complications that these cars may have is a minute detail in the ever evolving spectrum that is the saftey of these cars for the people inside an out.

BECBDB495322,"I think that driverless cars have the potential to be significantly safer to use than manually driven cars. Many people get sucked in to their phones when they should be watching the road, don't feel comfortable in control of a car, or are just bad drivers. Driverless cars can lift the responsibility of all the passengers' safety off of the driver's shoulders. They can save thousands of lives.

Google's driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Even though theirs require partial manual control, this is a good sign of the safety of driverless cars. Yes, people may still need to learn how to drive, but they would need to drive less with one of these cars. The less a person drives, the less chances there are of an accident on their part.

Sensors on cars have been around since the 1980s, and have become advanced enough to detect and respond to dangers such as out-of-control skids or rollovers. They can make the car apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. This is much more control than a human driver could manage alone. Driverless cars have the capacity to possess many more safety features than manually driven cars.

Since a driverless car would not be controlled by a person, it would not make the same mistakes on the road that a person would make. Even a partially automatic car could activate safety features to stop itself from going out of control. Driverless cars have proven themselves safe so far, and are likely to be even more safe in the future. That is why I think we need driverless cars.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
D69B5E55F39D,"Can you imagine in the future where you see floating cars and cars driving with no one in them? I can not, because I believe cars where a bad idea from the beginning. Why use cars for transportation when you have your own two feet? Driverless cars are a bad idea because they give human beings reasons to not get out of their house, they can cause accidents, and the cost to make driverless cars will be too expensive.

Driverless cars will make the human population obese and ignorant. It will cause people to not communicate with others. For example, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. By 2020, driverless cars will be the big hit and everybody will want one. They can pick up their kids from school; go get groceries whenever they need, so the parents will not have to walk around the grocery store for so long; eventually it will be able to anything you want it too. Without the daily driving and walking we do, the human race will soon become fat.

What happens if a driverless car causes an accident? If there are no humans in the car but your car is totaled, how will you change car information? How will you talk to the other person to see whos fault it is at? How would your car drive home if its been in an accident? Driverless cars can not do everything.

The cost to make driverless cars is going to expensive. Where do you expect to get the money to make these cars? For example, they need a whole lot of sensors; cameras to watch that the driver is remaining focused; and the most important bit of technology in the driverless car is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. All this fancy technology has to come out of someones pocket. Who's pocket do you think the goverment will take it out of? You are correct, the American's pockets. All our hard earned cash going to a car that we do not even need.

Driverless cars would probably make driving safer all throughout the nation.

These cars would probably also be easier to handle and make driving more enjoyable.

In these days, there is the technology to help smarter cars prosper.

Driverless cars may have some challenges but like the article states, these cars would change the world.

Driverless cars are much safer than the convential cars that are used today.

There are many reckless drivers out there that cause car accidents and deaths just about every day.

According to the second paragraph of the article, the driverless cars created by Google have driven over half a million miles without a crash.

Driverless cars would operate smoothly and theoretically, they could eliminate the possiblility for human error.

Under specfic conditions, some cars have been able to drive independly since 2009.

This could imply that it might not be that long before driverless cars start to take over.

Driverless cars would make transportation much easier.

Since attention would only be needed in a rare state of emergency, the driver can mostly just sit back and relax.

According to the eighth paragraph of the article, some manufactureres plan to develop in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.

The displays can aslo be used to alert the driver, if necessary.

Today, most drivers have to be constantly vigilent for harmful threats on the road.

Driverless cars on the other hand, will allow the driver to do something fun and relaxing while being automatically taken to a destination.

Modern techonology has allowed driverless cars to be fully developed with less complications.

According to the fourth paragraph of the article, Google modified a normal car by adding many different sensors to it.

There are also a video camera, automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and motion sensors.

Driverless cars may still need modifications because there are still faults in dealing with traffic and roadwork.

Despite these challenges, driverless cars are still the best option for transportation in this nation.

118328E15176,"Driverless cars are a very impractical design. These cars can not fully drive themselves. It also states that they would add entertainment as you drive. Driverless cars could malfunction, since they run on computers. Driverless cars could be potentially dangerous.

Driverless cars are not fully automated. The name is falsely implied because drivers must stay alert while the car is moving. If there is construction being done or a wreck has taken place, the driver has to maneuver around the traffic. Driverless cars can not be operated without the driver having both hands on the wheel. The idea of driverless cars is not bad, but in order for them to be called ""driverless,"" I believe that they should be automated and not require a driver.

The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" states that there would be added entertainment while driving, so that the driver would not become bored. This is a bad idea considering that driving, even with the car being automated, requires full attention. It states that a driver would be alerted when they need to take control. The driver could be asleep at this time and may not be able to hear the alert. The driver could also not get the alert all together.

Driverless cars run off of computers. Computers are not alwats perfect, and could often times fail. In the event of this happening, the car could stop, not be stopped, or fail to alert the driver of danger. If the car stops while driving it could create a terrible accident. The car could also not be stopped, and wouldn't be able to avoid the other cars or obey the traffic laws. It could also fail to alert the driver that he/she needs to take over, in case of an emergency. It is a very good concept, but unless the computers could be perfected, it could create a dangerous situation.

Driverless cars are not a bad idea. There could be many flaws involved with the making of driverless cars. I believe that it makes the design useless if it couldn't be fully automated without the use of a driver. The entertainment aspect could make driving a lot more dangerous, instead of safer, like the intended goal. The computers could also just stop working. Driverless cars are not perfect, but the idea could be built on. It all comes down to the drivers personal preference.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

What if when you drove your vehicle there was a computer driving next to you and driving you? Google and GE have made self driving cars that survey the surrounding area to have all the peripheal vision as a human and drive for the human. Google estimates the vehicles would use half the fuel used today and that these cars would fundamentally change the world. Self-driving cars use computers that proccess situations and scenarios just as well if not better than humans, still allow some control through construction or traffic, and elliminate the despised people that text, do make up, or eat while driving.

Most people would agree that computers are smarter than people and can proccess situations and scenarios faster than people too. For instance, I know of no one that can do math faster than a scientific calculator. So why not have a computer drive for us. In the end it would result in safer transit and maybe even earlier arrival itme. Smart cars, as the leading industrys call them, use a spinning sensor on the roof of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Humans can only see so much through their two eyes while maintaing eyes on the road. These cars are maintaing a constant image of their surroundings, not just what is in front of them. This leads to safer travel and ultimately smart cars driving better than humans.

While the computers do have a complete 360 degree view around them, they still require human interaction. BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" a car than can handle speeds up to 25 mph by itself. This smart car has special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel to ensure that in case of an emergency the driver can safley navigate out of it and overide the computer's autopilot. These smart cars allow you to steer, accelerate, and brake, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as driving through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must stay alert and ready to take control at a moments notice in case of an emergency, so humans are not completely out of control.

With all the technology and distractions at the wheel a world where the technology drove the car might not be such a bad idea. For example, there have been multiple accidents a year due to texting while driving. In many states you can get pulled over by the police for doing things such as texting at the wheel. But what if smart cars made the world safer from texting and driving, or make up at the wheel, or even the people that eat meals or take drinks while in transit. With smart cars people that do those things will have trouble doing them if they have to keep hands on the wheel, but if they still manage to get a text or bite of food, the smart cars will be in control and there to steer them to safety. This would keep not only the people who text and drive, eat, or do make up safer but the people around them would also be away from that danger that they themselves can not control.

Smart cars might not be the first thing many people jump at as the way to go. But smart cars might be one of the safe options to eliminate human error and reduce accidents, drving casualties, and risks. Smart cars are just as equal if not smarter than humans, they are not in full control in case of emergencies, and they can save a life if there is a driver texting, eating, or doing make up at the wheel.

Television and movies have developed a theory of these cars. The theory is how the car may look and also, drive. Google has had cars that could drive independently under certain circumstances since 2009. Google cars have driven over half a million miles without a crash. google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and a inertial motion sensor.

Companies are already, and have already, been making these computer driven cars. As an example, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Google made the modified Toyota Prius, and BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

These, ""driverless"" cars are not really driverless. Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless carb to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. The Google Cars must have an alert driver when driving. The Google Car cannot pull in and out of driveways. When dealing with road contrustion or navigating through an accident, the driver must take over then as well. The BMW, ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" can reach speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.

BDBB3AF5C30A,"A google cofounder, Sergey Brin, has invisioned a new public safety transportation system. His ide is driverless cars, the cars are expected to have many safety features, use less fuel, and expand carrying capacity. But are they really as safe as they are made out to be? How can this new idea affect manufacturers, drivers, owners, and insurance companies? Will this new technology solve any problems that drivers currently face, or could this vehicle create more?

Technology often does not work as it is supposed to and this causes frustration. In this case, if the technology does not work as it should it could be at fault for human injure or even death. If the vehicle is on autopilot and isn't familiar with its location it is possible that the vehicle could go off course or glitch. In certain situations, the vehicle may not do what we think that it will do. It will need our assistance, but if we are not notified then a driver may not know and it cold cause an accident. This brings up the question asked in the pasage, would this be seen as the drivers fault or the manufacturers?

Manufacturers and drivers may end up getting into many disputes over the technology within the vehicle. The problem is that the driver could ie and say that the vehicle never notified him/her even if they were actually controlling the vehicle. Insurance companies, manufacturers, and owners of these cars could be put into situations that they never woud have been put into if it weren't for the technology. Technology is a privledge, and it does not workm all of the time. Manufacturers will make thousands of hese vehicles, who's to say that you will be the one to be in the next newspaper add because your car didn't quite work as it was meant to?

There is always a risk with everything that we do. Driving a car has a risk, you could be struck by a drunk driver or end up in a ditch. Things do happen, but these self driving cars can not fix all of these problems. There will still be other drivers who refuse to use the driverless cars and they could cause accidents. If a drunk driver is about to hit a driverless car, what makes you think that your safety is guaranteed? There is always a risk, question is whether or not the risk triumps the expected safety of the vehicles.

Is it possible that the owners of these vehicles will be notified to take the wheel but instead they are asleep or not paying attention? Drivers could abuse the safety features of these vehicles and make it look as if it was the manufacturers faut rather than their own. The car watching the driver feature could help in this case but not in all cases.

These cars can still be dangerous as far as safety goes. That does not make it a bad idea though. Problems could lead to solutions and solutions may lead to the success of the vehicles. Also, the idea of using less fuel and having a wider space capacity than most other vehicles is also a very good feature to the vehicles. But can the manufacturers pull it off? It is likely, but will it ever actually happen? These vehicles may appear sooner than we think, we'll just have to see if they become a success or just another idea that didn't meet its expectations.

Cars that can drive themselves are a very bright idea, but they take away a the freedom that comes with getting your liscences, and learning the ablitily of driving. Having cars that drive without humans can mean more accidients if the cars can not account for traffic jams, other accidents, roadwork, and a work or school zone.

Learing how to drive is an important skill for teenagers and young adults to learn, because they don't just learn how to drive they also learn responiblity to pay for the gas and insurance bills. They start learing to take care of themselves so when they get in to the real world they don't have to rely on their parents to keep paying for everything they need.

On the other hand its a bad thing because they say the car tell you when it needs human assistance, but what if you're so busy doing the thing you were doing while you were runnning late you don't pay attention to the car telling you it needs your assistance. So before you know it you end up in a accident.

Some people think that the car isnt a good idea. They believe that ""the only safe car is the one that has a human driver in control at all times"". I see why they would think that . Considering the fact that all of this is running off of technology, who's to say that something horrible is going to happen. Technology malfunctions all the time , so what makes people think that these driverless cars are any different. So there's a problem with a car running off of technology. They say that they plan to have these problems solved , & a handful of car companies plan to have cars that drive by themselves in a few years, but they get closer to where they want to be with this everyday.

Thats how I feel on the situation of driverless/smart cars. Until they get all the problems under control & get everything to the point where no one has to wonder about what would happen in a certain situation, I think that they are a bad idea. They have good reasoning on why they should be made but the list of why they shouldnt overshines that.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
02F31B1CF826,"The idea of driverless cars sounds very fun, cool, and interesting, but I feel that this idea of driverless cars do not sound safe. My position on the idea of driverless cars that, I am against driverless cars only because, I feel that having driverless cars on the streets would be very dangerous with other drivers and pedesterians walking or driving across the streets.

In paragraph 6 of the article, it states that having a driverless car means that the cars will drive themselves and, even with the antilock brake system, the passanger of the driverless car and pedestrianas would be in danger if the passanger in the car wouldn't be able to take control of the wheel as quickly and easily as if they had a car where they were allowed to drive on their own without taking control of the car from the car being in charge driving itself. So, what I mean by saying this, is that driverless cars are the not the safest things to consider. Driverless cars should not be allowed out on the streets because, first off it sounds very dangerous, secondly, it sounds like too much of a hassal to worry about getting all of the technology checked out everytime something doesn't work in the car. Lastly, the last reason why I think that driverless cars should not be allowed is because, the cars and all of the different technologies could potentially be very expensive in the end.

To conclude my agrument on driverless cars, I do not think that driverless should be allowed out on the roads ever. I believe that driverless cars would always be a hassal trying to make sure you wouldn't hit anything or anybody while the car is driving and not you. I also feel that having a driverless car means that if your driverless car all of a sudden couldn't warn you about someone or something coming in your pathway and you do not see whatever or whoever is in your pathway, then you could potentially get in an accident and either severly injure,damage someones property, or even kill yourself and the person(s) you collided with. My last reason to conclude my essay is that, I believe that in the end, these so-called ""driverless"" caars will turn out to be very expensive to pay for, and keep getting all of technology checked out and made sure everything is functioning correctly, so you don't need to get more or new technology parts installed in your car. These my reasons why I think that driverless cars should not be allowed to be driven out on the open roads ever.   ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
44B191F560B4,"Driverless cars should be developed and used. There are many ways that driverless cars could help us. Safety is a main concern but many accidents occur due to the driver being disctracted or someone else's fault.

Driverless cars will have sensors to stay on a certain course and not get off track. The sensors could also detect if something is too risky such as backing up in a parking lot. When a time like that occurs the driver must drive the car until the car can handle the situation.

Many accidents occur due people using a celluar device and losing track of where they are. In a driverless car this could be prevented because the driver is not driving the vehicle. They could use their phones but they must know when the car cannot be piloted in a sticky situation. A driverless car could also be used as a taxi driver for those that drink and drive. Driverless cars can also help semi truck drivers that drive around for hours and hours.

Advanced computer systems could be put in the driverless cars to prevent enviromental issues on the road. The systems could also prevent possible rollovers and sliding off the road. It will be very costly but we can save many lives and prevent many accidents from occuring.

So driverless cars can prevent many accidents and they could help many people in making their job a whole lot easier. It will be costly but it will be worth all the lives that can be saved and helped. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
06ED39AC5A4D,"Each year more people are killed by driving accidents then the combined deaths of murder and accidents involved with firearms.

Many of these deaths and associated accidents are caused by driver error such as reckless driving, speeding, texting while driving, and driving under the influence. As a result, many traffic regulations, such as the institution of specific rules of the road, police enforcement of safe and sober driving, and required safety features, such as airbags and seat-belts, have helped to reduce accidents and mortality rates on the road. Yet, these mortality rates are still high due to the human trait of being able to fail due to biological reasons (fatigue, anger) and psychological and cognitive reasons (driving under the influence due to a false belief that ""alchohol does not affect me that badly"" or that ""I do not need a seat-belt, I likely will not get into an accident). Henceforth, the addition of automated driving systems into cars are of extreme benefit due to their ability to negate these human tendencies and traits as well as adding a degree of redunency to driving.

First off, automated driving systems are usefully as they can negate the negative effects of human biology such as fatigue and rage. As demonstrated on paragraph seven, the article explains how care manufacturers are considereing the implementation of cameras which can monitor drivers. While the article implies that these cameras are to be use to detec whether or not the driver is even looking at the road, it is not wistful thinking to believe that this technology can be improved apon to detect facial features (such as opening and closing of the eyes, swaying of the head) to detect fatigue or other features (angry expression) to detect drivers who are tired or experiencing road rage. The car from this point could take measures, such as suggesting the driver to stop at a gas station to get coffee or to pull over to calm down, and thus prevent the driver letting his or her biological symptoms affect his or her ability to drive safely.

Additionally, these automated cars can also be used to stop drivers from preforming reckless things while driving due to their stupity, ignorance, or inmaturism, by forcing the driver to comply with driving law in or for he or she to driving. One example of this forced compliance could be that an automated car could demand a breathilizer test to be preformed in conjuction with the use of a key in order to start up the car, ensuring that only sober drivers can operate a vehicle. Additionally, the car can also perform a similar action by requireing the driver and passengers (which could be detected by sensors and cameras) to have their seatbelts on before driving. Finally, a car can either force a driver to pull over if it detects that the driver is driving recklessly or alert athorities so that they can stop the driver before he or she has the chance to hurt someone else. Henceforth, the computer systems in car can help a driver not to cause an accident by either their physical and/or cognitive state or by their irresponsibility.

Finally, automated cars increase safety due to the concept of redundency. Since there are two capable operators in the vehicles, (that being the human driver and the car itself) one can take over in case the other fails, such as the car taking over if the driver falls asleep or the driver taking control if one sensors has a malfunction. This redunency improves safety as both systems have to fail instead of just one in order for an accident to occur. This redundency is why commercial aircraft have an extremely low likelyhood of failure, as the plane has both human redundency (two pilots in case one becomes incapacitated) and mechanical redendency (auto-pilot kicks in if both pilots become temporarily unable to address all the issues occuring in flight as well as back up systems in case something like electronics or pneumatics fail).

Henceforth, through a combination of redundency and the ability to help drivers protect themselfs from their own faults, whether they be physical, emoutional, or mental, the automation of cars will make the act of driving a much safer endeavor. While some may state that automated cars can never reach the intuition and agility of a natural driver, automated systems should and would not replace human drivers but instead suplement them as in the case with commercial aircraft. Henceforth, when the risks and the benefits of automation in driving are weighed, one can come to the conclusion that automation is driving will inevitably make the endeavor much safer.

1A02FEA9FEAA,"Driverless cars are coming out really close to use! I think they will be a really good advantege because they can be helpful for disabled people, they can help get around serority(old) people and a really good advantege for people that hate driving during the night part of the day and even for long trips. I wouldn't consider myself as a person agenst or with the driveless cars, because in my point there are good and bad things about these cars. Would you trust a driveless car to drive you around?

Places like Florida, Nevada, California, and direct columbia have let people drive these cars around there city because they believe that they would be able to work and would like to be know for were the car was used at.

Acorrding to the book it says that ""The law belives that more states will follow as soon as the cars are aproved and safe."" Automakers are continuing on fixing the problem that are willing to be solved be for they are aproved. The BMW company has tried to make a driveless car but can out different from what they expected.

The driveless cars are not that bad, i mean the help you drive around. They icluded a GPS, a Dubbed LIDAR for a 3-D car surrounding. The have also reduced the engine power and applyed brakes on the individual wheel which allows better respones and contral then a human diver could. The BMW company made a car close being to the driveless car, the car can function up to 25mph but has a sersor made to make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact the car can steer, it can accelerate and brake by its self but it is also desigined to navigate the road ahead to tell the driver when it requires human skilld, it will navigate working zones and even accidents. So most of these cars still requiere human skills and are not ready yet have earned the driveless car name.

Some cars have considered using carmeras to watch that the drive is focued on the road. The GM has requested vibrating seat's for the driver, which could be a bad idea to put in a driveless car that they dont even know if it is ready to work on it's own without kill or having someone injurd yet. Most of the thing included to the cars can be displayed but something not avalible to the drive is texting will drive that is a system featured of the safty.

Driveless cars sound like a fun thing to try out but we'll never find out if its really safe to use, even when they announce it and say it is. I still think there is a good side and a bad side to it because the only word to know about something and to test it is if its same for us to trust. Most companys like Nissan, Mercedes, Benz, Audi have said that they would have a car that can drives themselves by 2020, but i would belive that Mercedes would have a driveless car ready by 2020, but would behard to belive in right?

Tesla has projected a 2016 (this year) release for a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific condition since 2009. You could do so much more when you have an independent driving car that you can with a non-independent car, if something is about to happen, you will be warned and it uses half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility that a bus. Beacause of the reasons previously mentioned, I stand in firm affirmation of the development of driverless cars.

When you drive a driverless car, you can do so much more with you time in the car. If and when driverless cars become a thing, texting/talking while driving laws could be abolished. But by 2020, texting might even be obsolete and we might be just speaking to the phone while it types for us. We've all known girls who do their make-up in the car on their way to their destination. With non driverless cars, this is extremely dangerous to the driver, the passengers, other cars, and pedestrians. Even though most girls know the danger of this, they haven't stopped, so why not make is safer when they do do it?

If something were to happen on the road like an accident ahead, road blocks, consruction, etc., the driver would be warned before hand. The warning could be a number of thing, whether that be a vibration in the seat or a beep.

Self-driving cars are so much more eco-friendly than regular non self-driving cars. They use half the fuel of today's taxis. Think of how much fuel that would save America. Less fuel used means less pollution in the sky and it might even help with global-warming. Think of the polar bears and other endangered species!

43CD63426055,"I beileve the tecnology of ""Driverless"" cars is necessary in todays society, and should be used for its worth. One of the few big ideas i saw in the article was the newer use of sensors in the vehicles we use today. Many of the sensors today are used to warn and stop the driver from any collisions or accidents that may accure, at any moment. I beileve that this technology is needed now more than ever for everyone, and not just unexperienced or handicaped drivers. I am currently still learning how to drive and will get my license very, and i am very cautious of my peers driving too. I would feel more comfortable that the car could stop itself wiith out the drivers noticing, and possibly stoping to stop a collision or save my very own life. I would very much like to see this technology come to fruition, and let the world harness it's abilities to further mankind towards a safer and better future.

The laws aginst the use of these ""Driverless"" cars are very reasonable too, and need to adjust for further research towards the safety of the people they aim to protect with these laws. I beileve they dont realize that testing and researching these new methods is a step foward, for safety, and not for just the sake of testing variables on somethings. They don't seem to understand that these technologies are being invented to help save people today. If you searched on the internet for just one second you could find all sorts of stories, about their own cars saving the drivers from creating a terrible mistake and saving their lives. These laws make me question us, as a society, more than ever, and as a society how are we allowed to grow in knowledge and sciences, if we cannot test our ideas? We must further sucome to the new technologies we have available, at this time, but we must not lose ourselves in context. We have to push towards breaking these laws aginst testing and accept the new technology, for the future.

As a child i watched cartoons with flying cars and cities in space, and in todays age we have the ability to strive for this dream of the future. One day I hope to be sitting in a cab that s driving itself perfectly fine and not releasing large amounts of toxins into the air that we all breath, to survive. This is yet another thing to admire of these ""driverless"" cars, and that is the ability to use much less amounts of fuel, rather than traditional vehicles. As you may already know cars pushout lots of burned fossil fuels, but with the new technology that has been presented, these cars can use less fossil fuels. The burning of less fossil fuels is a ""thumbs up"", and has a lesser impact on the world, rather than a world without them.

I gladly accept the new technologies that ""Driverless"" cars have presented to me today, and feel safer knowing a computer system can save me from human errors. I can guarentee that this technology is safe and efficient for the world, and should be further studied to further the new technology to more suit society. The further interest or study in new sensor technology is to thank, just as much as the fuel concerns we have today with our own vehicles. The technology of the future is here, and we need it to help save the lives of many people. We as the society of the future should not stand back and watch the possibilities of our future be restricted by laws, that just dont understand the purpose of this technology.

3B7E7C18280B,"To me, self-driving cars represent the most obvious step towards a safer, more efficient future in driving. Of course, the idea seems appealing. After all, who doesn't want someone to drive for them while they're stuck in rush-hour traffic? But we have to more closely analyse the laws, ethics, and safety aspects before moving full-steam ahead into what could possibly be the future of driving.

Self-driving cars have a lot of potential for both public and private use. This type of technology could be a major hit on the consumer market. Self-driving cars could take the most tedious part out of road trips or decrease the number of traffic cops we have to employ under government pay. One of the most appealing aspects for lawmakers and voters is the increased safety of self-driving cars. This is one of the most heavily argued topics in the entire debate over self-driving cars, even though Google's cars have been operating for over half a million miles with only a handful of minor accidents. One of the other pros that isn't mentioned nearly as much is the increased efficiency of high-traffic areas. Self-driving cars are smarter at merging and driving in dense traffic, meaning rush-hour traffic jams could one day be a thing of the past.

The other side of the debate for self driving cars is public transportation. Uber is already planning a self-driving taxi service, and other companies are sure to follow. Self-driving buses could also be used with schools or in major cities. Having a fully automated public transport system could make modern cities more efficient than they've ever been.

Unfortunately, many of these same benefits offered by self-driving cars have a negative alter-ego. One of the major effects of increased automation is increased efficiency. However, as we move towards a fully automated world, we lose a lot of jobs in unspecialised industries. Laws would also have to be reworked for nearly every aspect of the traffic system. How and why would teenage drivers take a driving test if they're never going to have to drive a car? Will human drivers and AI drivers fall under the same category in the eyes of the law? There are still years and years of legal red tape that has to be cut through before self-driving cars can even make it onto the consumer market. In addition, there are soem ethical problems involved with programming self-driving cars. Programmers and developers could be a fault for deaths caused by bugs in their program. And what should you do if a crash is unavoidable? Should you sacrifice the passenger to save a pedestrian?

As a result, I believe that self-driving cars can and should someday be a part of our everyday lives. However, dozens of laws will have to be rewritten, commities formed, and lawsuits fought before we can even judge automated cars under the same laws we judge human drivers. There is a huge amount of potential for a faster, safer, more enjoyable traffic system, and it lies in self-driving cars. But, for us to be able to implement any of it, we need to make some very difficult decisions. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

I believe that driverless cars could be a very good thing if they are put in a reliable companies hands. These cars could seriously hurt the passanger if something goes wrong. If you relate the technology that the manufacturer puts into the car and the technology we have now, alot of the time it will shut off or one thing stops working. We already have cars that we can tell comands, we have had cruise control, we have bluetooth so we can speak to people, and the advances will just keep coming. Those two examples are the kind of things that companies are trying to work through and the law is keeping that in mind. If the companies that have been working on cars that can be driverless come through it will be a huge part of technology and transportation history.

My second reason is what happens if one night an E.M.P. goes off for some reason and my car locks down, I can't get out with the doors being sealed shut.

We could be the most advanced nation in the world, no we would be the most advanced world in the galaxy.

This is my conclusion to this article. I believe that we could do this, but we have to be smart about it. Driveless cars must be in safe hands, not reckless drivers.

It also would get us fustrsted because we wouldn't know when to control the car or if when controling it every other time while driving. Driverless cars could also make humans not want to have the car anymore because we would want to start driving by ourselves. Also it would make us teenagers wanting the car because we aren't driving it and we dont even knwo how to control or dive a car. We don't have our license or permit yet. It would lead to the teenagers turn to drive and they don't know how to use the car which would to either a car accident or the death of a teenager because of the driverless car.

The affects of haveing this car is a lot. One affect of having this driverless car is that it would need a lot of gas just for one car. Another affect is that the car it self could lose control and something bad could happen to the driver. It would also need multiple battery changes because the car driving by itself takes a lot of battery juice from the car. The driverless car could also affect us because there could be times that we would want to drive on our own and the car want let us. The car could shut down on us while it's driving.

Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the lady in the story has a regular car, who knows if she will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that she will be, and she will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe.

Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or she is safe.

In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or she for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the woman in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the woman probably have gotten into a car crash because she was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the lady did have a driverless car, she would have been on time for work and she would have been on time for work safely.

Well, although many take a certain side when it comes to for and against these driverless care, rarely do any think about what it would do to help society and improve or technology.

Our knowledge of technology has completely changed the way we design, make, and see new products. In 2009, Google reinvented the way humans look at cars. Independently run cars have come to the attention for the United States today.

We, as humans are particularly biased when it comes to not having to do something. In this sense, Americans are blind to the negative effect these driverless cars have. Driverless cars are a way for Americans to get out of taking time to drive somewhere, making them completely lazy. Cars like these are a hazard to the community and to the lives of many.

It is stated in a recent article that came out called ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", that ""there cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash""(2). This is their job, to influence you to think that the new and improved cars that they have invented, are good for society. The article given to the side a measuring scale, that's all it is. To see how far technology has come along but even more so seeing how much we could improve.

A driverless car is just bad new at this point. Without it being fully developed and driverless I fear that we would start experiencing more and more tragedies. The danger hazards of a driverless car are off the charts.

Before we start thinking about selling these Google invited driverless cars, we should work out all the kinks and bruises that could easily turn the new technology in to a bad thing.         ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless car will prevent many accidents due to people mistake. Which are normal we make mistakes, But with the vechile watching our steps or even driving for us would be a benfit for that driver.

Google states ""google cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"". The cars aren't compeletly driverless; they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? your probably asking, although, the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires such as navigating through work zones and around accidents, until then they are free to text with a cell phone, call someone withour stoping. In this way, the driverless car is actually a safety feature.

How the car does this is with position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.

But the most important piece is the LIDAR(spinning sensor on the roof), it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all is necessary for the driverless car to replicate the skill of a person at the wheel.

Even when the car require the driver aid, displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays.

Over all I see benfit in having driverless cars, They driverless cars allow us to complete as task such as putting on make up or text messaging someone, but they can still allow us to take over if needed. Which means that we do not put our live compeletly in the mercy of ours cars, but rather allow the car and the driver to work as together.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A4CA0FC5E37D,"Driving to some people is time consuming and boring. Imagine if you had a personal assistant or even your own private taxi service. That service could take you where ever you want and you dont even have to drive.

You could take a nap or catch up with friends, even enjoy a nice meal before you start work. Some people who work late shifts and even start early in the morning would prefer sleeping then driving to get to thier job in the morning. Well maybe one day, but that day could come sooner than you know it.

Movies, Television, Art and much more have inspired the creation of new tech. This includes self driving cars; ever sence 2009 the trails of making a self driving car comes to life. With test from google and BMW working with new tech to advance cars to be self driven. Some say that this is a great idea but others would disagree. With new tech comes a lot of software and coding one wrong thing could lead to injury and even death. This is why people would rather not have a self driving car out on the road.

Driving out on the road is not a toy or game when going at 60 miles an hour, any thing could happen. This is why cars that can drive them selfs are not available to the public. Many test are still being done and even though there isn't a self driving car out on the streets yet; there are still cars with new tech intalled from the test. Cameras, motion sensors and alerting systems are beginning to be more comin. Dangerous enough when you don't see something out in front of the street and possibly hit it; a sensor could prevent that or a alert that lets you see it before any thing happens.

So even though we don't have self driving cars out on the road we do have some sort of tech that comes close to it. Sooner then later could you see a car that drives it slef but for the mean while its always better to be safe then sorry. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9592B30E7AA8,"I do not agree with the idea of completey driverless cars. I feel that it is way to dangerous for the people inside the car and the people around the car, escpecially if people are asleep inside the car when something goes wrong. If there is even the slightest malfunction while a person is not concious, if a sensor goes out, then it could cause an accident and possibly lead to injury or death. I like that most states have banned the testing of computer driven cars, there are still a few that have not including: California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. What if there are accidents like said in the passage, who is held accountable? I think it is best to just stay away from the driverless cars.

In the passage, the cars that are being tested are not completely driverless yet. The passage said that the car can only do so much without a human, if there are accidents and work zones on the road then it needs a human to control it. According to the passage, General Motors has been working on things to get the driver's attention when the car needs a human, they have been developing driver's seats that will vibrate if in danger. Some of the other options that companies have considered is to have flashing light on the windshield and some other heads-up displats. Another option is the idea where they have cameras watching the driver so that they know whether or not the driver is focused on the road.

My favorite part is that most states have the testing of computer driven cars banned, with a few that have not budged yet. I think this is a great idea because if it wasn't banned or made illegal then companies and manufacturers would be testing it everyone and possibly causing accidents. If a malfunction were to happen while a manufacterer was testing the car there is no idea on what could happen especially if they do not have a human in the car. The car could swerve off of the road and hit someone or crash into a building and explode! I hope that California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia come around and ban the testing too.

I believe that there shouldn't be driverless cars, there are to many things that can go wrong during a test of it. Even if manufacterers believe that they have everything fixed with the car and release it to the public, one of the sensors could go out and your car would lose sight on that side of the car. I believe it is best that we all stay away from the production of driverless cars, especially given how many things can have a malfunction.       ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

It will be a scary day when driverless cars become the new normal. Imagine roads filled with cars, but the drivers are like unalert zombies. Sure having cars that drive themselves sounds splendid, but would the benefits really outweigh the cons?

For many people learning to drive and getting their license is a huge milestone. It is like one step closer to becoming an independant adult. I can't imagine teens growing up and never learning to drive. That would be like not learning to swim!

Driving is a skill that people need to aquire even if driverless cars become popular, because machines fail. You can't always depend on machines to be accurate all of the time. You might be thinking that machines don't make mistakes as often as humans, but humans are the ones that make the machines. What happens if you are riding in a driverless car and it just stops working? Will you just sit there and wait to die?

In the passage it says that most driverless cars aren't actually driverless, they need assistance from humans. The fact that the car does most tasks like steering, accelerating, and braking makes it easy for humans to get distracted. Most people get distracted by their cellphones alone! If they thought they could totally rely on the car to do what they needed, they would probably be totally unaware of their surroundings.

There is a reason that only a few states allow the use of semi-autonomous cars. The laws are written for cars that are controlled by humans. The laws in place currently would not be suffecient for self driving cars. Sure the laws could be changed, but who gets to decide what the guidless to self driving cars should be?

Human brains are easily adaptable, but machines need to be programmed. What happens when a car faces a situation that it isn't ready for? Also, what happens if someone hacks into the car's system and makes it malfunction? There could be a computer virus that would cause all the cars in the world to crash.

Although I do think there are lots of cons to driverless cars, I do acknowledge the benefits. Early versions of semi-driverless cars have been somewhat successful by driving half a million miles without a crash. However, that doesn't mean that totally autonomous cars will be successful.

I think certain feautres on cars like cruise control are a huge benefit, but I don't know if I'm willing to trust machines to take the steering wheel yet. Who knows, maybe fifteen years from now I will own my own driverless car, but there are some huge advances that need to be made first.    ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
66DA2F1F5213,"driverless cars are dangerous and pointless. the car is suppose to be ment for the driver not to use the instruments in the car right? so why do the driver have to be alerted to still grab the weel every once in a while to drive. there is no point in making an computerized vehical when humans have been drinving cars themselfs for decades now, why try to change it up now.

another reason why we should not have computerized cars is computers take up our whole world now already for instance: our credit cars, our taxes, most jobs are using technogly,our cell phones, when we go to colledge, libraries, jobs mostly obtain computers too. so it shows that we cannot have nothing to ourselfs everything is based on technogly, nothing is on hand made or hand worked anymore. so why should we let the govnerment take over our cars as well ? so the computers are going to be rulers of our world forever for everything.? i dont think so.

i think it is very pointless and stupid to spend so much time and so much money on unneeded materials. they should be spending money on more important tasks. such as like medical insurances. housing agencys,(ect) i dont think they should put so much time and so much money into something that is not even secure enough.

my last reason concludes why there should not be driverless cars because, what if the driver gets shot or passes out and is not aware of the car alert to assist the driving? then the car will crash and it will be a total wreck. so ther's no point in creating a car that is not even all the way reliable. the car is not one hundred percent secure and can fall out of sorts.

Would you trust a car with your family, or friends in it? I dont know if i would completly trust a car to get me where i want to be without it wrecking. I mean yeah i guess you can trust the smart people who made it, but i don't know if you could fully trust the car itself. Anything could go wrong.

My opinon is my opinon, other people may think differntly. But oh well. Most people would probaly buy this exspensive car just to look cool, but i mean would you rahter risk your safety? I dont know if i would. I mean look at all the people who do drugs, and other things just to look cool. They risk their lives, waist their money, and time just to impress somebody else. That's stupid! People can take over when they want to, so i think that that's kind of good to be able to have that protection. If somethings going wrong, then the car would make noises basically saying "" hey something wrong here"".

I think its honestly up to the people, and how they feel about getting in a car that drives on its own. Yes, i kind of do think it would be fun to be able to have a car drive me, but on the other hand, it would be kind of scary too. There are some reasons why i'd pick to own one. I would own one, because they would be nice to own. It'd be interesting too! I think i could get use to having a car driving me around. Another reason why i think people would perchase this car, is to have it drive them home, or around place to place when they can't drive because they are drunk. I think that's smart really, because their not risking other people lives, when their out getting drunk, and try to drive themselves home. So yeah im 50/50 about driverless cars. I kind of have my opinon on owning one, and not owning them. So im not really against it, and im not fully sure about ever owning one. If the world decides to drive driveless cars, then i'd probally be more willing to own one myslef. I think i'd rather see how driverless cars go with other people before i purchase one.

The amount of crashes that occur each year could decrease, because of the reckless driving that occurs and the amount of money we give to fuel taxes will also decrease tremendously. these smart cars will lessen the dangers on the road.

Making these driverless cars will not be cheap investment. All the technology and test practices to make this car 100% driverless will take time and will cost money. But all the time and money put into this project will be worth in in the end. This car will have far better responces and control than a human could ever accomplish by themselves. As the technology becomes better over the years soon the cars will become completely driverless and will be able to detect all the dangers and hazards happening around the vehicle. Human drivers can't detect every single hazard on the road, it is just to overwhelming.

DB763612D6A9,"I am against the development of these cars because I do not think everyone should have them. These cars could be a great idea, but there are some things that could turn this good thing into a bad thing. There are people out there that mess these types of things up, there are safety concerns, and I just think this is unnecessary for some people.

There are a few reasons on how humans could turn this good idea bad. There are people that do drugs and alcohol and drive afterwards. These are the type of people that would mess this technology up. In the article it says how the BMW would need human control over the car sometimes and if there is a driver that is drunk, they cannot do a good job of control. I think there would be a lot more crashes with this. People could also fall asleep or get very distracted while sitting there waiting for their turn to drive.

One safety concern I have about this technology is what would happen if the robot car messed up. Technology is not perfect and has major issues. Although these cars would have some safety features, it can always mess up. The in-car system that has entertainment for the driver is also a distraction. Things happen in split seconds and this kind of system would leave the driver distrated and unaware of the things going on around them.

This technology is also unreasonable to me because the only reason i think someone should have this type of technology is if they are handicap and cannot drive. People that can drive should drive on their own, I see no point to having a computer driven car. It is something that is not needed and extremely lazy. I do not think anyomne needs a car to drive them around if they can do so themselves.

C866BD9DDD68,"As time goes on, there are many aspects of life that change, technology being a huge factor in today's world. A lot of things come from technology, the advancement of it has helped people in many ways possible, but many people ask what the downfalls are or if could we take technology too far. Scientists today are experimenting with driverless cars which doesn't always rely on a person to control it. While it is a cool thing, some people fear that this could cause a lot of accidents in the community and be a negative thing rather than it being positive. I personally think it is a good thing and there are many reason to consider advancing into it.

The first reason I think driverless cars should be a thing is the convinence of it. Technology has proven to be more reliable than people in a lot of cases, such as a taxi. With driverless cars, you don't have to worry about getting into an accident because of the efficency of the technology used in the car itself. I think it is safer in most ways because of the smart sensors and brakes to prevent wrecks that are put onto the car. Overall the response on smart cars can out do any of that of a human driver.

Another factor that comes into play with smart cars is how it compares to humans. Lawmakers say that the best safety is from an alert driver. Today there are a lot of people that aren't so alert, such as people that are intoxicated or just tired. Wrecks as we know are a big issue and a lot of them come from people that aren't alert because of them drinking or using other drugs, now I'm not saying this is most people, but quite a few. Another thing is roadrage, people tend to get mad behind the wheel because of slow traffic or other causes thar cause accidents or incidents that cause the law to come into play.

The last reason I think we should consider driverless cars is efficiency. In the passage, driverless cars would have sensors that cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, which in general allows for better response. Imagine if you were driving and got distracted, something bad could happen really fast. That would never happen with a driverless car since the main goal of the car is to get to any destination. The efficiency comes in to where the person in the driver seat could take over at any time in case of something in the way or just bad traffic issues. There are many ways for the car to notify the driver to take over such as vibrating seats or sensors to tell the driver what to do.

In conclusion, I think that driverless cars are a thing that we should continue to strive towards. They are convinent to use, are considered really safe, and compared to humans, will be better overall. Traffic issues would go down as well as accidents originally caused by human drivers. You also wouldn't have to get bored on the drive since they have ideas of having a screen to watch entertainment on while the car is driving. Driverless cars in conclusion would be a good idea to improve on in the future.                         ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Now, the driverless car has been invented. Many will be pleased with this, but many will not. I, for one, am against driverless cars for several reasons. Some of those reasons are liability and cost.

One concern of driverless cars is liability. If a driverless car gets into a wreck, who should be held responsible? Some would say the car manufature and other would say the person in the vehicle. There are so many different type of situations that every situation would be different. I think that the car manufacture should be held responsible for the driverless car since they made the car, unless the person inside the vehicle had to take control. There will be controversy over every car accident.

Another concern is the cost that these cars will bring to every city. As said in the readin ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", roads might have to be redone. This will cost thousands for many cities and states. If another city gets new roads before another then a driverless car could not go into that city. That may be the place the passanger is wanting to go also. Producing these cars would cost more also. More satellites would have to be made to accomidate all of the driverless cars, too. If there are too many driverless cars out and the system fails, that will cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.

Futuristic ideas have always been sought for, one of them being driverless cars. There are many different position on them, but mine is that they should not be made.

Driverless cars are becoming safer and safer over the years. The article states that Google has had cars that could drive independendtly under specific conditions since 2009. It is now seven years since that point and the reliability and the safety of driverless cars has gone up. If we have driverless cars the roads would be much safer.

It creates great times and memories for the both of you. I am against the developement of driverless cars because they can malfunction and become cause harm and because its good for people to learn things on their own.

Driverless cars can malfunction and become dangerous for the passengers in the car. They may seem great at first, but then what will happen if it breaks down or something spontanious happens that the car is not programmed to recognize? The world is very unpredictable. It would be good to have a human and alert pair of eyes on the road.

Its good for people to learn to drive on their own. Just like the text says, "" ...so far, Google cars aren't truely driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadblock or accidents."" Humans, or passengers, need to know how to do those things until that is programmed. Also learning to drive is a great way to bond with family members or a trusted lisenced adult. It creates memories. I know this from experience. When I turned 15 my mother wanted to teach me to drive. Our relationship was on the rocks around that time but her teaching me to drive only made us smile, laugh, and reminisse on me alonost killing us.

B2415E0DD03B,"5 seconds; 5 seconds is all it takes for a driver to make a crucial mistake the could cost you, or another driver's life. Every day, accidents occur that can leave automobile owners disabled or even lifeless. Many car manufacturers have realized this and have already made attemps to fix this issue. The creation known as the ""Smart Car"" is believed to have a better response time, and more control than a human driver could manage themselves. I believe ""smart"" cars are the future to a safer road, , as well as a break while the car does all of the busy work.

As stated above, Smart Cars are the future to a safer road. A World Reknown Innovator, Google, has made steps towards this since the 2000s. In 2009, they created a car that could drive under it's own control without the use of a foreign imput. Their computer-controlled cars have driven ""more than half a million miles without a crash."" This new-age technology is all a result of position estimating sensors, a rotating sensor on the roof that has a constant updating 3D model of the car's surroundings, also including more radar sensors scattered all over the car. How's that for safer driving?

The biggest concern for the legality of the car is whether or not it can meet the requirements of what the law has in place. Many qualifications must be met to have these on the streets. The issue is, who's fault is the accident. The creator or user.

All of these features sound exciting and you may ask yourself, ""What's the catch?"" In order for proper safety percausions to be in place, the driver is requires to be alert at ALL times. BMW, a leading car manufacturer, announced their creation known as the ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" in 2013. This car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves like most smart cars. However, it is required that the driver keeps their hands on the wheel at all times when the car is in motion. Other manufacturers have taken similar steps, such as GM's vibrating seat when the car could be in potential danger while approaching another car, and Google with a heads up display indicator.

To conclude, safety is the main priority of car manufacturers world-wide, as well as the Law. Through years of innovating, the idea of a car that can ensure safety as well as entertainment, while being street legal, appears to be within grasp. By 2020, many car innovators plan to have the ability to do so. The question now is, how much better can it get?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6AF2D4E39173,"I believe that driverless cars should still be worked on. They would make life much simpler, and could also save a lot of people a lot of time. Driverless cars are the future, and we should be ready to embrace them.

If driverless cars do become a thing in the future, lives would be more convenient. If they managed to make them able to work completely without human assistance, then people wouldn't have to focus on driving. If they need to get something done in a short amount of time, they could just use a driverless car, that way they could work on it while on the road. Of course, since the few driverless cars there are now still need human assistance, this could take quite a while to develop, but I'm sure they'll get that far eventually.

There are some people who drive really slow, and some who drive really fast. With driverless cars, this would not be an issue, as all the cars could go the same speed, so everyone could get to where they need to go in time. As for the issue of possible crashes, if all the cars would be programmed the same way, this wouldn't be a problem. If there are still crashes, that would be a manufacturer thing. They were the ones who built and program the cars, it's their responsibility to program all the cars to be as safe as possible, so no one can get hurt.

This could also save people money in the long run. Since all the cars would be programmed the same, therefore no more wrecks, people wouldn't have to worry about having to buy a new car in that event. Also, they could just take the public transport car, and have it go wherever they need to go, since they would be much more accessible.

In conclusion, Driverless cars should definitely be a thing we need to keep working on. They could benefit the world so much. Plus, things would be a lot more interesting with driverless cars.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
C18BB3762DCE,"A stop to driverless cars

Over the years technology has changed dramatically in many ways. Cell phones have the ability to shut off smart tv's with a push of a button, computers have the ability to hack humans with special softwares. People have developed many new ideas about technology with the modern world today. Driverless cars are a whole new introduction to technology today. Are people for or against drieverless cars?

Some positive aspects of driverless cars include the following, they can handle up to 25 miles per hour-special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They can steer,accelerate, and brake themselves. All of the driverless cars are designed to notify when there is a road that requires human skills, examples would be accidents, construction zones, etc. When a vehical is in danger of backing up into an object, the seat vibrates to get the drivers attention. Driverless cars could also help senior citizens that are not capable to drive themselves places that they need to go.

Some negative aspects of driverless cars include, human drivers staying alert and ready to take over in a situation. Having someone drive for you when you have the ability to drive yourself could cause you to get bored at times. In case you do not feel your seat vibrate it would already be too late to try to control the car yourself. One major negative aspect of driverless cars that me, myself would mostly worry about is car malfunction. Car malfunction happens quite often and what would happen if all of a sudden the car starts going crazy? Drivers, passengers, and pedestrians would not be safe if the car had a malfuntion.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars would not be safe. Although the driverless car does have some positive aspects, most people would want to get in a car where they feel safe in, not a car where they feel something may go wrong in a tough situation. I am totally against driverless cars only because I would not like to be in a car that I do not feel safe in, let alone a car I have to worry about.         ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
5F2BD56DE768,"In the modern days so much technology is being developed. Now google is starting to make driverless cars. Many people are amazed with the idea of a driverless cars. But to me the idea of driverless cars are a scary thing. The cars still need a human to be able to controll the car when the computer can not. Like when there is an accident a human still need to be able to opperate the car in a safley manor. Yes the cars alert you when you must take the wheel, but at the same time i feel like they shouldnt be called driverless cars if they are not completley driverless. Just like if a human was under the influence of drugs or liquor they wouldn't be able to fully opperate the car. This is why I think we shouldn't have driverless cars unless they are actually 100 percent driverless.

D176ABB06812,"""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" This seems to me like a bad idea. The driverless car, while having some good qualities, is overwhelmed with bad qualities. The risk and danger of driving would greatly increase due to the cars being more in control. Not only is this dangerous, but the cost of the vehicle will increase because the product is new and ""advanced"". When adding up the time being taken to drive a car rather than take a taxi, the taxi takes a greater amount of time to deal with. Some of the negative aspects of the driverless car are much greater in numbers than the positive.

The risk of the driverless car is much greater than the risk of simply driving oneself everywhere. Like taxis, putting your life in someone elses hands is always a greater risk. The driverless taxis just double the chances out wrecks considering that the car still has more kinks than anyone cares to recognize. In the reading, it was stated that the car can brake on it's own. While that could be seen as a convienience, it can also be seen as a danger. The car may brake when it's is not supposed to which could cause a wreck. The driverless cars are still not totally able to navigate through traffic with ease. Having a regular car seems to be the safer option, because the driver is in complete control.

The driverless car is much more costly to manage than a car controlled by the driver. The product is new, so the initial cost will be much higher. Also, the technology is supposed to be more convienient and user friendly. These positive aspects always seem to cost more than a regular car. The driverless car will have such a large initial cost, the owner of the car will be owing the company in which he bought it money for a long time.

It always seems more convienient to take a taxi rather than drive yourself in a big city. In larger cities, taxi services are found everywhere, but in smaller towns the number of taxi's are much smaller. It is unneccisary to take a taxi in smaller town because the traffic is more manageable. The taxi services are only needed for large cities to handle all of the traffic. The new driverless cars are still not managable on their own in high areas of traffic.

The number of cons seems to outweigh the pros. Safety is always a big issue to everyone because it is important that everyone is safe at all times. As the world progresses money seems to be more of an issue. Driverless cars are seemingly too expensive to buy in the first place, let alone the price of gas being a taxi service. The convienience of a taxi is always so pleasant until they are unneccisary, like in smaller areas. Personally, the driverless cars just seem to have too many negative qualities to be worth production. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9655BB90BB07,"My position on driveless cars is it shouldn't go past a point where a human driver can not take control of the car. Technology can be faulty and if a human can't take control of the car some dangerous consequences will happen. Also if a driver can take control of the car, if an accident occurs they will be responsible. Then the business that created the car will not be liable. Finally the cost will be a major problem, a mass majority of people will most likely not be able to afford this vechicle. Which can be a marketing problem, when introduced to the mass public.

Time has shown that technology does have flaws, some very dangerous ones. Now imagine these flaws happen when you're on the highway surrounded by other cars. A consequence paid for these techonological errors could be death. If the car glitches out, a human driver will be needed to take control and keep the sitaution in control. Cars already have faults, and technology also can have significant errors. Would you put your life in the hands in some possibly faulty piece of technology? This is why human drivers need to be able to have control of the car if needed.

Responsibilty for accident is a subject that's in the air about these vechicles. If the human driver has overall control of the vechicle, the possibility of an accident would be in thier hands. This will pull out some major possibilties of a manufacturer being taken to court over the car. If full control of a car is given to the hands of technology, the manufacturer will most likely be sued on multiple occasions if an accident occurs. If the overall power of the car is given to the person in the driver seat, the final verdict of an accident will fall onto them.

Cost is also a mojaor factor. When introduced to the masses who will be able to afford this car? The price of a driverless vechicle would be very expensive and most likely not affordable to the evryday middle class people. What's the point of making this car if not it's gonna have a huge market? If the car is partially driverless it most likely be less expensive to make and would be more cost effective to the masses.

There is no need for a completely driverless car. It would cause a landslide of problems. If technology is faulty it could cause injury or death. If its completly driverless, the manufacturer would be responsible for accidents. Finally the cost would be way too high for the average person in this economy. These are allsignificant reasons there should not be a driverless car.       ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
099B960840A2,"Driverless cars are more than likely a big thing of the future. There are pros and cons. However, when it comes to the safety of human beings, I'd say to focus on more of the cons. Bad things happen all the time, an dmost of the time they are accidents. I'm not sure I'd risk my life on something I'm not in control of.

Let's start off with the pros, because there definitely are some. Elderly people, or even extremely young people. May find it difficult to get places that they need to go. With the help of a driverless vehicle, grandpa would never miss another doctors appointment. That is, until his driverless vehicle that you so carlessly persuaded him to purchase puts him in a coma. People that are afraid to drive or physically cannot, they could really use a driverless vehicle to help them get place to place. Now, let's get down to the cold hard facts.

Technology, it screws up all the time. Millions of people have troubles with their cell phones, game systems, and cars (yes, even regular vehicles malfunction) every single day. If some manufacturers can not even get a regular everyday car to work correctly without shutting down, blowing up, or getting unalined, how are we to trust that a driverless vehicle will suddenly keep us safe. Sure, drunk drivers would be less of a problem, but how can you trust a drunk man to properly operate a driverless car? You can't. Anywhere that there seems to be a pro for these cars, there's a con not far behind.

Raging drunk idiot get in his driverless car. He decides he wants it to go full speed ahead at the man crossing the street. It's too easy to use these cars as weapons and call it a malfunction. There would be more cases of vehicular manslaughter than ever before. I don't know about you, but I like my life without driverless cars. They're too hazardous.

I don't want to live in a world where cars aren't things you drive. I like my life. I like knowing that most of the people on the roads know what they're doing. Technology has failed us again and again. I don't trust that it wouldn't do it this time around.      ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Have you ever dosed off while driving the smart car will allow you to catch a few z's and will alert you when something goes wrong on the road.''Google cars alert you when pulling in and out of driveways,navigating through roadwork,and dealing with road accidents.

A98E8EFFC8A9,"Driverless cars have always been a big idea for the future. However, there are some really important pros and cons for driverless cars. Driverless cars can be very dangerous to not only the individual driving, but also to everyone around. Perhaps driverless cars isn't such a good idea. Your biggest concerns would be the technology failing and the safety of everyone around it.

Safety is the MAIN key to a driverless car. Since a driverless car would be driverless, not only the driver would need to be alert but everyone around it would need to be, which is common sense for any type of vehicle or transportation. Considering the fact that the human being is always in charge of an accident with a regular car. That woudn't be the case for a ""driverless car"". Now even though the driverless car have sensors and other types of monitoring to prevent accidents and disfunctions, who's to say the driver isn't paying attention when they need to be and something goes wrong. In paragraph 9 it talks about how traffic laws are wriiten to assume that the human is in control at all times. That's completely understandable, if the human doesn't do what he needs to do to make sure his manufacturer is working correctly, it would be his fault for not taking care of it.

For everyone else around a driverless car, would always be in great danger. No matter how well the car itself is functioning, you dont know if everyone else is paying attention to their own vehicle. Pedestrians around the driverless cars have no control over what it does. If something happens to a pedestrian, who's responsibility is that? If a sensor on the car isn't working properly, which it should be, there would be more deaths and injuries to people around the vehicle and to the person inside of the vehicle. The minor issues of a driverless vehicle could cause a huge problem.

Even though having a driverless car seems like such a good idea, there could be many things to go wrong. For example, the manufacturing could disfunction in the middle of driving. Now someone that would condone a driverless car would say, ""You would need to make sure everything is properly working before taking it out on the road."" That's actually not all you would need to do. Not only do you need to make sure everything is working properly, you would need to make sure what ever is functioning the car is functioning correctly at all times. One of the biggest concerns could be a driver might not know what could be wrong with a car and if something is wrong with the system, he wouldnt know and the car would just break down or stop working.

Driverless cars could seem like a good idea sometimes when your lazy becuase you don't have to worry about actually driving the vehicle yourslef. Of course people are going to find a driverless car fascinating, but the most important thing you would want to worry about is safety and having the best functioning technology. Technology can always fail, so no matter how well it may seem to be working, anything could happen at anytime. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B3165EE32FDC,"Driverless cars, is this in our future? Driverless cars have become a growing topic in the past years. Recently, more information has become visible to the general public. Are these cars a good idea? I believe driverless cars are not needed in the near future. Development of these cars is an unneeded advancement in technology. Driverless cars, as of the technology we are now given, are not as reliable as an independent driver, they invade your privacy, and it would take more money to install technology in roads to be able to make use of these cars. Driving is a symbol of independence, in the sense that you are given the responsibilty and freedom to go virtually any location you please by driving yourself there.

Self driving is a commonly used way of transportation amongst many individuals. Driving is a way of transporting ones self from point A to Point B. When most individuals are driving, the average spped exceeds 25 mph. Driverless cars are only reliable for simple driving functions up to 25 mph. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars are completely driverless."" If driverless cars were to become a prominent part of every driver's life, would it be very practical? In the article, the author states what the cars are capable of, even with the driverless technology, the car will never be fully independent. The car is not completley driverless, this will be an unneccassary advancement until manufacturers create a truly driverless vehicle. So, using these new cars may be seemingly pointless, as the driver will still need to be paying attention and the car has sensors to make sure the driver is paying attention. This leads me to my next point, is a driverless car worth giving up your privacy?

Driverless cars not only have sensors on the wheels to make sure you are paying attention, they have cameras on your dashboard to ensure you are paying attention. ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" While some people may argue this is for the safety of the driver, there is no valid reasoning that there should be a manufacturer watching your every move to ensure you are paying attention on the road. Cars that have been driven that are not driverless have been doing, overall, well. While drivers are able to pay attention to the road regularly, having a camera creates an unwanted pressure to the driver. Adding the pressure of knowing you are constantly being watched as a driver can raise your stress levels, resulting in frustrated driving. Frustrated driving is an unsafe form of drivng, where as driving while relaxed and unwatched, relieves the pressure of knowing you are not the only person in the car. In addition, in the current days and in the past, has there ever been a need for manufacturers to put a camera in your dashboard to make sure you are driving safely? The answer to that question is no. Drivers, while not being watched, are expected to follow the laws and pay attention. Using cameras in the car and invading the privacy of the driver is an unneccasary addition, as there will only be use for the driverless portion of the car for up to 25 mph; therefore there is no further reasoning to begin developing these new vehicles.

If driverless cars are only useful for up to 25 mph, is there really any practical use for them? If driverless cars become the new form of transportation, there will be money involved that a lot of people do not have. Having smart cars requires smart-roads, ones that can communicate with the car to ensure the safest possible driving experience. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" When manufacturers create these smart roads complementary to their smart cars, who will be paying for them? The most likely answer is a raise in already inflated car prices. When the smart-roads are installed, hypothetically speaking, will the road be smart enough to communicate with all different manufacturers types of cars? Will they allow regular cars to drive on them? How long will the instillation take and will it be on every road? These are all things that require time and money. Manufacturers see the big picture of driverless cars running the roads, but that simply can not be the case, given all of the obstacles needing to be overcome and all of the questions that require answers. With all of the money it will require to run cars that are still dependent on drivers, will there be any valid reasoning to spend all of this money on new roads and new car development?

With all of the advancements in technology, there should be a threshold to the items consumers want versus what they need. Manufacturers should not be trying to create new technology, but improving what they already have created. Using driverless cars, still require a driver to pay attention and take control after a certain point, invade your privacy by watching you with a camera, and require more money to create the new road systems and create new cars. In conclusion, I believe there is no practical reasoning that these cars should be further developed. ",6,Driverless cars,Text dependent
3C06F404EED3,"There's a bunch of controversy over the driverless cars. Some people hink that they are a good idea and some people don't. Many people have their opinions on this topic. Now it's time for me to tell you mine.

In my opinion I think that driverless cars would be a good idea. Driverless cars would help out a lot. Like in the first paragraph in the passage it said that the cars would use half the fuel that taxis use, and it would offer more flexibility then a bus. Just imagine having a car like that.

7E7CABAAEA46,"Driving is often one of the most frightning things to many peole whether they are starting to get their permit, or if they've been driving for a long time. The idea of driverless cars came to the mind of Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google. He even envisions a future where the public can have access to a transportation system such as cars that can drive themselves, and a public-transport taxi system that uses half the fuel of modern cars. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author wrote about the positive and negative sides to these inventions. The article covers many things about them; however, it does not fully explain the true nature of such vehicles being available for public use. These cars should not be allowed to be bought and used by the public.

As stated in paragraph two of the article, it states that these driverless cars aren't fully driverless. These cars have no crash thus far, but how safe is it really compare to their rival brands? ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents,"" What the sentence means is that these cars don't have one hundred percent control of how they drive. They require the driver to be full alert when pulling in and out of their driveways. Little do they know, that accidents can still happen when they have claimed they are better than any other car brand that uses the same radars and sensors.

Google isn't the first company to think of a smart car which isn't a surprise to those who have looked into different car brands. Companies like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by the year 2020. In 2013, BMW announced their development of a car called the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The difference between the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" and the driverless car is that BMW added a design to where the car itself notifies the driver when human skill is required. Another design element to the car is that the driver's seat actually vibrates to alert the driver when the vehicle is in danger of backing into any object. This choice of car is more safer than the driverless car as the Google car relies on the driver to focus on the road. Every driver has looked away from the road before, so it wouldn't be a surprise if an accident were to occur. Though there is another safety mesasure added to the Google car, a camera to watch the driver to make sure they keep their eyes on the road ahead. This could lead to some issues for privacy as people have been sensitive in the pass about their identities being shown to corporations. Not only could this lead to court sessions, but also lead to a possible debt for the company.

As stated earlier, the author did list both negative and positive things about the Google car. Paragraph eight shows the psychological side for drivers with this car, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?

We have to interpet the driving fun in a new way,"" Dr. Werner Huber stated. Manufacturers hope to do that by having entertainment and information systems that have displays that turn off when the driver needs to pay attention, an option drivers who want to use their electronic devices do not have. It is stated that this option is a safety feature; however it could be more of a distraction. The use of electronics has increased, and today's modern society is easily distracted by this. When the car needs the driver to take the wheel, how will the driver react while they're busy looking at a screen? Safety is a big concern, and so everything should be looked at and thought through.

States nationwide have already made it illegal to drive test computer-driven cars. Some states have limited the use of it, and it is because the safety of the cars are still not certain. If the car is proven to be of safe use, new laws will have to be made and so will the coverage of liability in a case of an accident. If most states have seen it as unsafe, why continue to research ways to make smart cars? Automechanics have focused on their work, and assume that these problems will be solved in the near future. How can we be so sure?

Technology everyday is improving little by little, and so is the need to travel. We have the technology to make whatever the mind wants to create, but some ideas should stay ideas. It's not a terrible ideas, but it could bring more trouble for everyone business to home workers alike. Safety to the public should always be the number one concern, not how high tech the car itself is. Instead of causing more accidents due to the car mechanics, we should let the drivers learn properly how to drive.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FAEF7499B133,"The article ""Driverless Cars"" is about the stance on when and how driverless cars will be made and deploded onto the roads of the United States and elswhere. When I read the article I was fasinated by someparts of the story and not happy about other parts. I believe we shouldn't have driverless cars or have some version where we can turn on and off the driverless mode.

If we have driverless cars I wouldn't buy one because it is so much easier to me in my opinion just to drive it on itself. The reason being is that I don't believe they will be as safe as they say. The reason I say that is because people might want to drive their own cars and people might not like computers controlling their every move. I personally think that since most of the world's population already know how to drive it will just have more deadly accidents. In the story it says ""The combination sof all this input is to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" They don't say it will improve human driving just that it will mimic. So why would we replace something that has worked for a hundred years with something that will work the exact same way and not improve it? I don't get it.

Now I like that we have cars that will be able to make the roads safer with sensors. That's something we can capitilize on, not driverless cars that change nothing except the driver. Tesla will not release a car by 2016 because it is 2016 and I've not heard anything. The technologies not even there for people to drive on highways and it's a big waste of time on all those engineers when they can be making something to make this world better.

DD6A2D1D9E7D,"Imagine being in a driverless car and the car turing against you and crashing. That is the exact reason why I am aganist driverless cars. I feel like driverless cars are dangerous, unreliable, and not affordable. This article made me feel like it is even more unsafe than I orginally thought. I feel like it is unsafe for people to be in a car that does not have a driver, because of it's limited abilities and how little technology there is for it.

I think that having a driverless car is dangerous because of its limited abilities. The article said that driverless cars can not navigate through work zones and around accidents or pull in and out the driveway. If the person in the driver seat were to fall asleep at the wheel or be completely distracted how would vibrating their chair and flashing light get their attention. The technology could malfunction and that is extremely dangerous. Imagine being in the passenger seat going 60 MPH on a highway and you have a gaming device or are watching TV in your car, and then out of no where you wrecked into something else. You had no warning or no advisery that you were in a dangerous situation because that technology failed you and just caused a crash. The only solution that could possibly work is for manufactures to have cameras in the car watching the driver that is a positive. It could also be a negative based off of how it is a invasion of privacy. The smart roads would help in these situations but would cost to much money so it's practially eliminated.

Having a driverless car is plain out unreliable. If everyone has a driverless car the roads would be filled with computers and technology controlling every move and turn on the roads. Just one thing could go wrong and there could be a serveral car accidet or someones life could just have been taken. What if the steering starts acting up and it can stay in the right lane and another car has a driver who isn't paying attention then they collide. All that happened just because a car steering started messing up. Something even worse could happen for example the brakes stop working. Imagine going the speed limit down the street but someone was speeding and just got in a accident right in front of you. The seats start vibrating so you wake up and see the situation in time and try to hit the brakes and it didn't work. That would've caused another accident based off of it's unreliability with its technology. The coordination system could mess up and you end up somewhere completely off target then what you were expecting to be. All the unpredictable factors that make driverless cars unpredictable just overweight the postives of a car driving you because you don't feel like driving.

It could be to expensive for everyone to get a self driving car. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have self driving cars by 2020. The question is will be able to afford the car or be able to pay the insurance. Most cars are expensive but afforadble over a course of years because you pay a monthly payment. Imagine buying this brand new self driving car and then crashing it even though it wasn't your fault and you already went broke trying to pay for it. How would you even be able to pay for it to get fix, the thing is you would not be able too. It might be to expensive for the average person.

I think it just is not smart to have self driving cars on the roads. It is to hazardest for people to mainly rely off of it when anything could go wrong. They are trying to make it more safe by putting in cameras, or vibrating seats, and entertainment to keep you away. That's all positive stuff but that doesn't mean it is realistic. There is no promise that any of that could do what it is expected to do. I think we should just stick to people driving cars for a better and safer driving experience on the road. It's to dangerous, and unreliable, and potenially to expensive for the average person. Let's let humans do the driving and stop having technology run our lifes. ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
162E62453359,"I think driverless cars will be a good invention for the future. I don't think we will have to pass a driver's test to get to drive one. This will save time out of our days that we spend studying and practicing to pass those permits and tests. Although these cars aren't completely driverless yet, I believe we will get there soon and our progress on it is fascinating. ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents.""

Driverless cars have been thought of since around the late 1950's, it's just people or companies didnt have the technology, we have today, to make them. The cars also save money spent on gas and repairs. The article says, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

To conclude, yes I believe driverless cars are the way to the future. They will benefit us more than they will do harm, if any. Many companies have already started building their own edition of driverless cars. BMW have cars that steer, accelerate, and brake on their own, but even they sill need driver's assistance. And what about the driver's laws, will you have to be 18 to get one of these futuristic cars, or will there even be an age limit since the driver won't do anything?

""If traffic laws change, new law will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" the author pointed out a good point that has to be made before these development of these cars hit the roads. ""If technology fails then who responsiblity is it the drivers or the manufacter,"" driveless cars would bring a downfall of the company if technology fails and more accidents occur and more law suites would be against them.

Drivers wouldn't be more aware of thier surroundings anymore instead of paying close attention to the roads just in case your car glitches they will be distracted by thier phones instead or maybe puting on make up. Texting and driving is the most deadly distraction there is when it comes to driving , with the driveless cars that gives them a little lead way to do so and not paying attention to the roads.

What is the purpose of a driveless car? ""Why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver?' If manufacters want to make this devlopment by improving the technology world these questions have to be anwser. How are these cars impacting the world besides half of the payment on fuel. ""Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing in- car entertainment,"" driving is suppose to be serious many lives are at danger each day because of a vehicle weather your in the car, outside a vehicle, or even beside it anything can happen in matter of seconds if drivers don't have controll or even paying atttention.

Road conditions such as construction or even bad weather I wouldn't want my car on cruise mode I would full control in case the roads are slick.

4EBEF6C1D74B,"Driverless Cars Are Not Good!

Driverless cars means a car that does not need a human to control of the car. Driverless cars are not safe because you can't tell if something bad can happen to it or not. If it's safe, why aren't there any in the public. Even the producers of the cars are not 100% sure of the condition. The car can't deal with big problems like; dealing with complicated traffic issues. It is better to use the now days cars than the driverless. It would cost a lot more than the cars that we use now.

The driverless cars are not trustworthy. What if you fell asleep while they car can't deal with the traffic issues? The cars are not use yet where the people like us can see it. What if the car doesn't hit the brake when you're about to crash? Some people are more confortable when they drive.

It may be the double price of the cars that we're using right now. It is better to have Honda or Toyota than the driverless car because you have the control of the car. It is important to have control of the car because you might want to change your location when you're driving. You save more money. You can feel more better if have control. If you're on driverless car; I am sure that you would feel scared.

Some people feel more confortable when they drive because they don't trust the driver. Technology is high but is it high enough to drive but it's self? If you're really sleepy and the driverless car is in the situation of traffic issues; what you it do? You might as well just crash. If you drive the normal cars it is safer and better. It is safer because you have control of it. If you're too sleepy, you can take a nap first.

Finally, driverless cars are cars that is not controlable. You don't know if its safe or not. There is no benefits; it's just that it is better because it uses less fuel than the amount we're using right now. Drive normal cars are better because it cost less. If you have control of the car; you feel more confidence.                ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9EBE86E9B255,"Driverless cars have always seemed like a likely thing for my generations lifetime. In fact, we thought we would be using flying cars by the time we were older. However, it is difficult to decide if driverless cars are a good thing or not. As far as the tests they have run go, the driverless cars seem safer than cars with drivers, and if the cars are fully automated they can reduse factors such as emotions, fatigue, and stress. However, technology can fail, which could lead to the cars being dangerous. I think, though, that driverless cars are a good idea because they can eliminate factors that can lead to humans crashing and they will make transportation easier for the standard person.

The first good thing about driverless cars is that they are not affected by many factors that can affect human drivers. The computers that run the automated cars will not get fatigued, while many people fall asleep at the wheel and can kill others or themselves. Also, these cars will not be affected by emotions such as anger at other drivers, which can lead to aggressive driving and mistakes on the road. Plus, the cars will be able to see almost as much as their human counterparts as long as their radars, such as the LIDAR, are powerful and accurate enough to send an accurate reading back to the computerized vehicle. This will hopefully mean that the driverless cars will crash less because of factors such as emotions and fatigue.

Another reason why driverless cars are a product to look forward ot in the future is that they will be able to form a ""taxi system"" of driverless cars. This would make transportation more practical and easy for many people. The driverless cars would be more practical for some people because, if they can completely drive themselves, the passengers would not need a liscence or insurance like they would if they were driving the car themselves. However, the car would perform the same duties as a car they might own, unlike other forms of public-transportation. For example, busses cannot pick you up or drop you off at your home, so if the bus stop is not near to your house, it is not reasonable to ride the bus to work or other places. However, the taxi service would be able to pick you up no matter where you were. This would also be helpful if you were stranded somewhere and you needed help.

A final reason why driverless cars are an exciting innovation is that they are much safer than the standard car with a human driver. Google's driverless cars ""have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This is an incredibly high mileage for never having a crash, and it shows that these cars are going to be incredibly safe when they are released to the public. Even thought the cars are still just being tested, they have never had a crash. Granted, the cars are not completely driverless, but the safety of the public is still the most important thing in the minds of many car manufacturing companies. These cars will prevent many people from being killed or injured in car accidents.

All in all, driverless cars are going to be something that will be incredibly helpful in the future. They help to reduce the factors that affect drivers, they will be more a very practical form of transportation, and they seem to be, in general, safer than other vehicles. The advances that have been made in the automobile industry in the last 100 years are truly worthy of our praise. We have come from incredibly basic cars to cars that can drive themselves, for at least some of the time. However, when you look at all the progress that we have made, it forces you to think about what we will come up with next. Maybe, flying cars are not that far away from being a reality.

Driverless cars are a perfect example of how well we have devoloped sensory, atomotive, and GPS systems. They also have extraordinary potential to make travel safer, and more efficient. They could prevent countless deaths or injuries because the majority of all car accidents are caused by human error, a driverless car would never make decisions out of haste or excitement. Instead cars would travel consistantly and safely.

The developement of driverless cars could lead to several significant technological advances. Innovations inspired by driverless cars could lead to safer, or more efficient vehicles. At the same time, developing driverless cars could lead to significant inventions.

Driverless cars are the solution to the biggest cause of car accidents, human error. Thousands of car accidents are caused as a result of poor, or impaired judgement. If cars could drive themselves, this problem would be effectively eliminated. A driverless car would never make the decision to speed or run a red light.

In addition to being a safer alternative to human driven vehicles, driverless cars could also be more efficient. Driverless cars would never get lost because of their advanced GPS systems. They would also take the fastest, and safest routes. Driverless cars would rarely run out of gas because they would alwas be aware of the nearest gas station, and how much gas is in their tank.

In conclusion, Driverless cars should be fully developed, and manufactured for public use because they are a safer alternative to human driven cars. They are more efficient, as well.

06A4B7059258,"Using dirverless cars can be very dangrous in the world and I do not think they would be a very good idea to have around, they could have things wrong with them in many differnet ways, cars need someone to control them. They are for transportation, they are made for someone to drive them and making them driverless is not the best thing to do.

Driverless cars could always have its bad things so say youre driving on the street and there are people walking on the sidewalk, maybe the car just starts to swerve and drives into the people. Would that be the peoples fault that are in the car or the people who made the cars fault, who knows because its really not the people fault that are in the car, but its not really the makers fault either.

The driverles car could always just have a malfunction, maybe say you are on the highway going about 60 and all of the sudden youre accelerating and end up going 90 then when to comes to stop it doesnt. It crashes and makes a big wreck well the people in the car are now hurt and we just want people safe, in the article it says ""most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe"" the best way to do this is to make sure we do not end up with driverless cars.

Drverless cars wouldnt be so bad maybe if it was only like the parking and backing up, maybe it could come in help with the people who are not very good a parking and things, but they should not be totally driverless.

0B54CC968D4A,"In a competitive world where automobiles keep getting faster, drivers are more reckless, and the death toll is rising, a solution to maintain public safety is necessary. Distracted and careless drivers may no longer be a public menace with the rise of a new technology, driverless cars. Driverless cars are beneficial to the public because the cars will have a better sense of the world around them, and they will eliminate most of the dangers of drunk and/or drowsy drivers.

The continued evolution of a self-driving car has created many advanced sensors that can sense and adjust to the world around it more efficiently than any human.

According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" a sensing system called LIDAR that ""uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" This would eliminate the current problem of blindspots and reduce the rate of collisions dramatically. The LIDAR system would also be able to instantly sense any changes in the surrounding area, where as a human would only be aware of a change if he/she looked in the correct mirror, or when a collision was already happening. There has also been an advance in wheel sensors. According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", these sensors can detect various dangerous situations and can ""...cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" Obviously, these sensors can keep the passengers and general public safer than just one unassisted driver.

Along with more advanced features, comes the elimination of many public menaces and dangerous drivers. If a driver is drowsy, they won't be endangering the public, because the car would be driving for them. There won't be any slip of the wheel to send a car into a ditch, a heavy foot excelerating the car into a tree or pedestrian, or fender benders because the driver was unable to apply the brake. Of course, if the car would happen to need a driver, the safety sensors could easily wake up the sleeping passenger with vibrating seats, as mentioned in paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" voices demanding the driver to take over, and other alarms to wake the driver up. In the case of drunk driving, even though they may need to take the wheel in certain situations, it would be quite rarely, and would still decrease the danger of drunk drivers. Someday the self-driving car may no longer need any human assistance, which would eliminate the danger of drowsy and drunk drivers all together.

In conclusion, the creation of self-driving cars would be beneficial to overall public safety because the developing sensors can already detect and adapt to changes more efficiently than a human can, and it would eliminate the danger of sleeping, distracted, and drunk drivers.

I thinks its okay if some people who need help driving uses them or might own one, but for everyone? Not exactly how I see the world becoming better for everyone because of that. The world evolves in many ways with transportation already now in numerous ways. The bike lanes are everywhere, people run, walk, or jog places, theres Uber thats now pretty big. But why a driverless car? So now people can become so lazy they barley have to drive? From the age where your remembering to be in a car you cant wait to be the next person to be able to drive thats somehing I & many others agree shouldnt be taken away.

A driverless car seems very possible within the next few years but I dont see any reasoning behind the fact that we dont need it. Maybe for older folks who have trouble or someone having so much money for one they just get one for the fact that they want to say that they have it. Also technicaly it's not even a ""driverless"" car. You still have to be awake, aware, & control it through tough spots like a car crash, & road work.

If your in a age where your getting a permit or you already have one dont you think when you was younger, before all that, that you couldnt wait to get your car & licaens. You would think of driving somewhere with someone if you prefer that out to eat or to a store littlle things that make you feel like you accomplished something. You'd miss it right? So why have a company tell you dont have that excitment for being a legal driver & showing you can do things, & share thier dream of just being able to sit in the car for however long with who ever your with just to sit there?

Evolution is a big thing to be apart of in this generation but its really simple to do if you have that idea. If its big enough to turn people's heads to whatever your idea may be then you have this platform of doing so. Changing the way people now get around is a big industry. There's always compatition & there is always going to be better. Wouldnt you rather have to drive to all the places you go yourself or would you just sit in the car doing nothing waiting for your turn to drive? I would love to be able to drive now & I will be able to soon. Nothing is better than the feeling of doing it yourslef.

So dont waste thousands of dollars of your hard earn money on something you can just do yourself. There's no reason in investing in that. They're simplilar solutions to this problem than you think.

38FB0AAC58D2,"Driverless cars in my opinion wouldn't with the people I know in my community. This is because it would take away from the the experience of being behind the wheel of a vehical. Yes driverless cars might be safer but why should they be forced to lose something that is enjoyedable to most individuals. If states just worked as hard on enforcing and finding new ways on keeping the roads safe we could avoid the dangers of human driven cars and they could still have their experience.

Personally, I could see driverless cars as a great oppurtunity to look into because it can keep the roads safe and the person behind the wheel can do whatever they would like. Therefore they should be ready to take over at anytime. I also like this idea because the passage stated that driverless cars would take half the fuel of today's taxis. There are many positives to this but I question how well the car would be able to keep the driver awake. The passage said that the car would be watching the driver to make sure they're aware but I'm afraid that some people may fall asleep not be easily awaken. Another concern I would be afraid to get into a car that relies on so much more technology. Any of the sensors cameras could mess up or even the warning displays could go wrong. This would be a big issue for me. With those concerns i also have plenty of positives with this new idea.

The passage says that they'll have to interpret the driving fun in a new way. I think that is a wonderful thought and could possibly keep someone aware if they're into the process of being in a driverless car. Most people today love to text and multitask in the car and that can be a problem in cars which are driven only by humans. But in this case of a intergrated process would give them that option of being on devices and doing other activities becuase it would help them stay awake and could be able to take over quickly. If they find a way to make it fun and find a way to make it a enjoyable experince i think most people will be into the safer and more effiecent taxi.

Whats the number one law most people break anywhere its keeping them the people around them and anyone else safe. Most people dont want to have driveless cars it would be cool but all the trouble just to make one of these cars is a lot more work then it needs to be.

In the passage the last point they talk about would be sensing the world. In this point they have to make a senseo that can not only see what's around them but also in fornt, to the ,side above, and behind. So thats why google has made a 3-D modling type thing thats on top of the car and they can see all around them. If we try to see how much this would cost in a car your looking at maybe a million to just buy it then you have to add in the cost of using this device. Its taking the landscape around you and using 3-D molding to make the land around you.

The car will not put you in any danger because it has the ability to keep you alert. It has sensors as said in the text ""special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" if a car was realy so dangerous it would not let you know to keep you're hands on the whell at all times. I beieve it does that so if anything goes wrong you can quickly drive the car if needed.

Further more the car signals you when you need to drive at important times. The car is able to do many things and will tell you to do the most important ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zines and around accidents.""

I am against ""driverless cars"", because its programming has many faults. In the passage they say that""The sensor werent there the computers werent there , and the mapping wasnt there."". That shows that the cars still need a lot of work on becoming ""driverless"" persay. Not only did they have technology issues it has cost issues. The prompt Paragraph 6 States that ""Radar was a device on hilltop that cost 200 million dollars.""it wasnt somthing you could buy at Radio Shack"". The technology that you would need is not cost effective or ready to hit the streets until they get some of the kinks out.

My Second reason for being against ""driverless cars"" is , because the car is really not ""driver less"". in The passage it says"" In fact, none of the cars developed are completely driverless"". the cars need actual humans to assist the car because the car is not programed for traffic or road blocks. Even in the passage it says""This means the human driver must remain alert and be able to take over when a situation require'. You can not simply take a nap and the car will get you to where you need to go you have to say awake and pay attention incase of rerouting.

Thirdly I strong am against the ""driverless car"" because its not perfected enough. The car doesnt abide by the United States laws in more then one State in the passage it states the ""in most states even to TEST a computer driven car is ILLEGAL"".

Lets talk about the first issue which was what if the computer in the car goes crazy. If it when crazy this car could possibly drive on the wrong side of the road, go of the road, and it possibly even run somebody over. I mean we cant say thats not possible because we see problems with technology everyday. So what could make it not happen, This could cause a serious life or death situation which would not be very good.

Okay now you could that it would happen because of new computer software and it updates constantly. Yes that could make it much more safe but the only problem is there is alway criminals in this world who kill. Now what or would stop them from hacking into one of the cars computer and change coding so it could crash. This could be a really big issue. Theres always new ways of hacking coming out so it would be to hard for people to just do it. We see it all the time that somebody has hacked into the goverment, into apples icloud, or even a internet server. Theres no way of stopping them before it happens.

The third big issue is what if a sensor or the sensor stop working on the car and the computer doesnt recgonize that. This could cause it to go of the road, hit another car, and crash. Yes the car does alert the driver but what would be the point if most people will put their alert down evetually getting used to the car. So their reaction would be slower and it would possibly be to late.

Nobody wants to lose their life or risk it with such a car. It would be much better if the human was incontrol the who time. Its much more safe and they get more experince to driving so when they are in a situation they will know what to do over a driverless car. So i say that we shouldnt have driverless cars.

6FB4BDEE27AE,"Cars that drive them selves shouldn't be developed. These cars shouldn't be developed because the cars they have now aren't completely driverless. All the ""driverless"" cars now can't navigate through any work zones or car accidents. Only thing these cars can do is steer, accelerate, and brake by themselves. What good are they if they can't manuever through things by themselves?

If someone was texting and driving in their driverless car and they let their car take over and their driverless car failed to drive by itself and a accident occured who would be to blame? Would the driver or the creators of the car be at blame for the accident? Safety would be best achieved by alert drivers. There is going to have to be new laws will be needed to cover liability of an accident. They say ""We have to interpret driving fun in a new way."" What fun is driving if you can't do it manually? Driving is a previlage why let you're car take the previlage of you driving?

Fully driverless cars shouldn't be developed. The automatic steering, acceleration, and braking by themselves are okay for a car. But completely driverless? No us drivers can stick to driving cars manually. Not wanting to drive is pure laziness anyways. People should enjoy being able to drive. There's no reason to not enjoy driving.

541C8C7DB698,"""Why Driveless Cars Are Not Safe?""

I believe that driveless cars should not be developed because these cars are not safe, they're not developed completely, and if the driver is not taking caution it can cause harm to other.

My first reason why I believe that driveless cars should not be developed is that they are not safe because sometimes it requires human skills when going through work zones or accidents. If the driver is not alert and is sleeping and the driveless cars notices a work zone or accident the driver is not going to know. Right now the traffic laws have written that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Driveless cars are illegal in most states because of safety precautions. Even if they were legal the trafic laws would have to make new laws to cover liability in care of accidents.

My second reason why I believe that driveless cars should not be developed is that driveless cars are not developed completely. The car driveless car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but alll driveless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead of them requires human skills. Since they arent not developed completely the driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when they there is a situation that requires human skills. The cars can be driven more than half a million miles without crashing, but the Google cars are really driveless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or with complicated traffic issues.

Finally, my third reason why I believe that driveless cars should not be developed is that if the driver is not taking caution they could cause harm to other people. If the driver sleeping and not paying attention to the road even though it is a driveless car it could cause harm to the driver and other people. Since the driveless cars are not fully developed the driver has to make sure that they are staying alert. Even though it might have a sensor in the car what if it sensor fails then how will the driver be alert that a traffic situation is ahead. Right now the traffic laws say the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Also driveless cars are illegal in most states and its also illegal even to test computer driven cars.

These are the reason why I believe that driveless cars are not to developed because they are not safe, they are not developed completely, and if the driver is not taking caution they could cause harm to other people.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
8B68F35A351D,"What I think about driveless cars isthat it should be allowed but it shouldnt. I think this because it would be kind of cool to have a driverless car but there will be some consequences that come with it. The person your are buying it from could persuade you into buying it but he or she could be lieing to you because its all about buisness. When my mom always says there is always a plot to something like if you buy the driverless car there could be things that could happen ,they will not tell you its dangerous. They will try to tell you how cool it is and why you need to buy it. There could be also some good things about it like being able to text and drive, eat while driving, or other things like multitasking. When you read they tell you that they are fascinating but in your eyes you see the best thing ever. So if I were to tell someone who wanted the car I would tell them to do some research on the car so they know how much they are spending and getting themselves too. After i tell thim this i will ask them if they really need this car or want it, and if they say yes and get the car later on when the car is not so good I am probably going to say told you so and they are probable going to look at me and smile. even though this BMW is a cool car the cost of it is not so cool so i think it would be both ways for me. I would say yes, but i would say not it just depened what you are really wanting to do when its out of style and no one wants the car any more. But there are even more consequences to this , if you dont take care of it it will be dirty and if you dont want to clean it the cost will be extremely expensive ,because its a cool carand more.

C7AAB0BFFCFE,"Driverless cars will be available in the future and there will be many benefits. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars and these cars are going to change the world with positivities. Google had cars ""driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" according to pragraph 2. With Driverless Cars, people could multitask, relax, and there will be more safety.

First of all, people could be multitasking when use atonomous cars. For example, a new employee was late to work. He didn't have time to get dressed. He took his clothing and went toward the car. That is when driverless cars come in handy. He could dressed up in the car and the car would just be driving itself. He could also read, take a nap, and eat.

Secondly, there will be more safety. According to paragraph 5, these driverless cars ""apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" In paragraph 7, it talked about how they can also handle the speeds up to 25 mph. The car will notify the driver when it is required by flashing lights and other heads-up displays.

Also, many people around the world are using cars nowadays. By using driverless cars, humans could save money. Who wouldn't want that? In paragraph 1, Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, says that these cars would use lesser fuel than today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. This is what everyone has been waiting for. The people who use this kind of car wouldn't regret this.

In conclusion, driverless cars will be bringing benefits to the people. These cars will change the world and the daily lives of humans. The reason is that, there will be less accidents and people wouldn't be injured very often. These cars could control the car than a human driver could. It could also saves money.

B8665C05D2B4,"People all over the world like to try new things. Everyday we are all faced with new and different challenges. Being in a car that drives itself would be trying something new and extraordinary. Why not drive in a car that drives itself?

Why not? This question is one of the greatest questions you can ask. A car that drives itself what more could you ask for. This would open new doors and ideas. On long car rides you would not have to drive. You could look at the scenery or enjoy your time with your family. A car that drives itself would be the next step into something amazing. Over time the cars will become safer and more reliable. This would mean you could go faster in the car. Your running late for work and it takes fifteen minutes to get there, well not anymore. The car would be like a car in Nascar you could get to your destination in an instant. A car that could drive itself would benefit a lot of people in this world.

In the reading it said that the driveless car would use half the fuel of a taxi car. You would not have to waste your money on gas every week. That would help most people out, even for new drivers that have to pay for gas. This also means that there will be less pollution and it will help people breathe easier. When the automatic cars become more reliable and faster and you are late to pick up your kids the car would get you there fast with no problem. Automatic taxi services will be in great need across the country because now people do not have to buy a car. People will have their own taxi car that will pick them up at their house and take them to work. These taxi cars would never be late since they are smart, so you would never again have to worry about being late. you also would not have to take your own car or wait for someone to come pick you up. People would love the experience of just having their own taxi service that would come to pick them up. They would feel more important and become happier.

How many wrecks happen each year? I was in a wreck this year. Another car hitting you, I thought, would never happen to me. I started driving a couple weeks later. That experience made me a safer driver. Still, there are people that get injured and killed every week because of careless drivers. This automatic car would reduce the amount of fatal accidents. Just thinking that you would be one-hundred percent safe in a car would be a great feeling. If you are an adult you could let your kids go into these car by themselves if you wanted to and you would know that they will be safe and will never be in a wreck.

Cars that drive themselves. This would be a great new experience. In 60 years I could tell my grandchildren that I was in the generation that could finally drive in self-driving cars. These cars would benefit the whole world in a positive way. Together we can make the world better and safer by having smarter cars. It is a new a way of living, a better way of living.

A good thing about driving a driverless car is that you could sit back and let the car do the driving as it says in (paragraph 7 and line 5).

They only time you would have to actually drive the car is in construction or a place where there has been a wreck. The negitive part to this car is that it is probably really expensive. You would actually have to pay attention to the road because the car might not react to something running in the middle of the street at the last second. And another thing might be it may take more part for the car to be driverless, which makes it harder and more expensive to drive.

Driverless cars are not a very smart idea, just becuase Google has made driverless cars since 2009 they have drove over half million miles without a crash, but Google cars are not driverless they alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of a driveway or dealing with something bad happing near them. The Google driverless cars are not so driverless.

My thoughts about the driverless cars is what happens if the car crashes whos fault is it the person in the car or the manufacturer? What if we get driverless cars what is going to happen to insurance for cars insurance people will lose money and if the car did crash its more money out of your pocket to fix it insted the insurance people having to deal with some payment. Car manufactures like BMW, Audi, ext. have made more of there cars safe for people and I do not think making them driverless would be safe. What if the car goes nuts and the driver has no control?

I feel that if we get driverless cars more people will lose there life then without them. We can not always relie on driverless cars or the technology becuase one day we will not have it.

46D1A8FC5D49,"Imagine a world where people no longer control their vehicles, the machines they used to buy for the pleasure of driving and not just to get around while playing on their phones. Terrifying right? With the idea of driverless cars coming into view in this modern day and age we must pause from imagining the cool idea of these automated automobiles, and imagine the scary possibilities that very likely could come along too. Many of the people who push for driverless cars only see the idea of a car coming to them withouth them even having to move a muscle. However, these people most likely haven't conscidered the dangers and downfalls of the self driving cars. With these driverless cars comes the possibility that we as a people will become lazy, forget the enjoyment that can come from driving, and most importantly create many new risks and dangers in the driving world.

These days many people are already too lazy to even walk, but imagine if people no longer even have to drive. With automated cars becoming a possibility many are losing their minds over the idea of being able to get around without having to put forth any effort. These people may have learned to drive at one point, but with automated cars they may forget how to drive causing huge problems if they ever need to drive a car that can't drive itself. If we create these self driving cars we will end up with an entirely new breed of lazy people who most likely won't drive their car, let alone walk. The possibility of these lazy folks may be tragic, but is easily moved aside by the fact that self driving cars will take away the enjoyment driving can bring.

Many years ago an idea was fromed that would bring the demise of horseback travel and this idea was the car. Since the day the first car was produced driving has brought many people an immense pleasure that is unrivaled. For years people would save their hard earned cash for the newest car just to feal the power or gentleness it had while they crused the open roads for hours just their car and them. Now that pleasure is being threatened by the idea of self driving cars. With these new cars we will no longer have this pleasure. These self driving cars take away the enjoyment of showing off how nice your car handles or how fast you can drive it as the car does the driving and controls the speed taking away the freedom and pleasure we once had. Although losing the enjoyment of driving is robbery, the dangers of these new cars heavily out weighs our loss of pleasure.

Today's dangers of driving are things such as speeding and lack of awareness; however the dangers of self driving vehicles are much worse. When in a current vehical the dangers of driving are mostly things we can prevent such as rekless driving and lack of attention. With self driving cars they could malfunction leaving no time to correct the vehical meaning an accident or even worse such as death. If a self driving car is having issues the driver may not even be away and seconds later could lose their life. With human controlled cars we have time to correct ourself and most of the time are aware of problems with the vehicle, but not with cars we don't control. These possibilities brought on by self driving cars should be seen before we make the leap to the next generation of travel.

When lazy people, no enjoyment of driving, and new dangers are the risk of self driving cars we should stop and take a moment to think. When I see the risks of these new vehicles I already know that they outweigh the non existant need for self driving cars. These self driving cars bring much more negative than positivie and I disagree with the idea entirely. Take a look at people driving in this day and age and the answer of yes and no for self driving cars is obviously no.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
665D11F129DF,"Driveless cars sound really cool and up to date to many people. People would think they wouldnt have to pay any attention to their surrondings, the road, or have any sense as to where they are going. These driving cars are developed to have vibrating drivers seats when the vehicle is in danger and the car has absolutley no control over itself no matter how dangerous the situation is. The driver himself would have to do everything he could to get the car in control and to avoid the incident as soon as possible. So why would even get a driveless car if you have to take control every once in a while? Driving cars sound pretty dangerous and could possibly put you in an accident.

When you hear about driveless cars, you'd really like to think you dont have to do much of anything since the car is in control itself and you have all this time to relax. Wrong. The driver DOES have to take immediate control when the car is in danger, (could be of backing into an object etc.), navigating through work zones, and having to work your way around accidents.

""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph."" Only 25 mph. How come these things can't handle being on the highway or interstate?

Maybe not lose braincells but in a way this driverless car could possibly mess you up in a way mentally because in that moment you dont have a care in the world and thing you don't need to pay attention to what's going on around you inside the car.

BCF53EE09F6F,"Driving while having not to drive seems like the way to drive, or does it? Being in front of the wheel but not taking any part of action that's going on seems like a brilliant future ability, but is it safe? In order to be safe at all times, the bottom line is driverless cars are dangerous because eventually techonolgy will go wrong, which goes along with risking your life, and not all people will take precautions in this situation.

People have been creating a variety of useful idea's thoughout the generation but overall this is one of the most dangerous. This car will have to always be checked because if something ever goes wrong with it, it will most likley crash. For example, if the car is driving on its own and somethings wrong with it, it could go ballistic because the car is controlled by itself and by the time you will take control of it you would be in an accident.

Dealing with the techonolgy of the car, your life is in great danger. Not only are you dealing with your own life, but maybe also the people in your car and drivers all around you. The driverless car does have ""special touch sensors,"" that ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" It doesn't mean they are paying attention to what is going around them. ""If the techonlogy fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" That is the real question about this whole argument.

This whole essay is ties up with the precaution of ""risking your life,"" driving on the road is already a dangerous thing to do but to allow cars that drive themselves adds up. As in the text says, ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object,"" there will always be people in this world who will be ignorant to these messages that the car implies. Sometimes the car will exaggerate the precautions you have to take making the driver think less of them.

There are endless of possiblities of things that can go wrong with driverless cars but also brilliant outcomes that can change the future.

E2E2F1025D32,"In the story the author presented both sides fairly. He stated the positives and negatives of driverless cars. I belive that driveless cars could soon be a common thing everybody uses.

First thing that might be a big problem is that they use radars and those can cost two hundred million dollars, that right there is a down side. One of the positives of the car it can do is that BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car can go as fast as 25 mph, but you have to keep you're hand's on the wheel. The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. It is all design to let the driver know the road ahead requires human skills, such as nabigating through work zones and around accidents. BMW's project manager driver said that it hopes to bring in-car entertainment and information systems. Some of the display can be turned off when the driver must take over. The in-car system is a great safety feature. One of the biggest down fall is the law. The law focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. They also said that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Because of this most states, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Some manufactures believe that even more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven more reliably safe. One of the biggest question is that if the technology fails and someone happens to be injured, who fault is it? Is it the driver or the manufacturer? I believe it would be the drivers fault because it was there fault they decide try to have a driveless car. This is one reason many people won't want to buy those type of cars. Even thought it has a big problem it can also be use for good things. Google cofounders said he can foresees they the cars will use half the fuel of today's taxi and is far more flecibiloty than a bus. Everybody wants to save money of gas so everybody would want to own one. He also stated that the cars would change the world. Another good thing is that if you're running late and you don't know that fastest way to get there, you can get you're car to drive you there while the car is taking the fastest way. If you are on a road trip and you been driving for six hours stright, you might get board of driving. So that's when you activate the car to drive by it's self, instead of stopping and taking a break and take long on the trip. If the car is driving when you're taking a break, then you will get to you're desination faster. But that could still be a while before we can do that. Driverless cars have a lot to work on before that can truly happen.

What to I think about driverless cars? I believe they can become a everyday thing we use. The only thing few thing stopping use from that is money and the law. Once we can get the more to start making these and we make a driveless-car that can meet the requirements, then we can start pumping out these cars that everbody would want to have.

F1E4BBACD7DD,"Cars that can drive themselves have been a fascination for many years, but exactly how safe are these ""driverless cars?"" Sure, not being in charge of drving your own car could be fun right? But, that is exactly the problem because you are not in control. The driverless car is just creating new paths of destruction. And sadly, I believe this new technology is more of a downfall, than a fun upgrade.

Not in control of drving can be very dangerous, even though many saftey aspects are taken into hand. For instance ""Google cars arent truly driverless: they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" And with trying to bring in car entertainment, ""displays can be turned of instantly when the driver needs to take over."" But being suddently alerted might not give someone enough time to take control of the situation! Plus, all of these statements call for the driver taking over at some point of time, because something is not safe for the car to do. Should'nt that say something?

Not only are driverless cars very unsafe, but they area also very expensive. Engineers at Berkeley tried using ""magnets with alternating polarity"" to create a smart-road. ""But they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical."" And would'nt this concept be the same for smart driverless cars? Think about it, manufacturers are making massive upgrades to existing cars. Bringing in a lot of brand new technology to create the driverless car, who could even afford one?

Technology can be very unconsitent and risky, what ""If the techonolgy faills and someone is injured?""

Ideas that were once dreams have now become reality.

Driverless cars are just one of these various inventions.

Coming in the next few years, driverless cars offer a safer, smarter, and more effective way to travel.

Driverless cars promise highly-advanded technology to provide safety and security for the passangers while allowing the human driver to ultimately remain in control.

The driverless car is a smarter car that requires advanced technology in order to drive successfully.

Some pieces of equipment include a video camera, a GPS receiver, and multiple sensors.

The most important part of the driverless car is the spinning sensor located on the roof.

By using laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model, this sensor allows the car to recognize its surroundings.

These sensors will also detect and respond to unexpected dangers such as rollovers or skids.

A driverless car is safer and more efficient.

With all of the driverless car's sensors and alerts, it is able to detect the situtation around it.

The car will be able to sense other cars, pedestrians, and landscape obastacles.

The driverless car will also be able to handle road situations better than a human would.

Since 2009, the driverless cars have been able to navigate over half a million miles without a crash.

Along with the car's safety, it is also more efficient than a normal car.

The driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis and allow more flexibility than a bus, making them the ideal mode of transport.

Even though it is driverless, the car also requires human control.

The driverless car will be able to steer, break, and accelerate on its own, but it will alert the driver when the situation requires.

The human driver must take over in situations such as navigating construction zones or accidents.

Even though the car is not completely self-driving, it allows for the human driver to ultimately remain in control of the situation.

With the driverless car's ability to analyze and respond to its surroundings while allowing human control, it will be the safest and most efficient car of the future.

The new-age technology provided in the driverless cars will make for a smarter car with the ability to be aware of the road, cars, and people, as well as any trouble that happens unexpectedly.

This technology also creates a safer drive while being efficient to the passengers and the environment.

With all of these self-driving features, the human driver will feel in control when navigating the required situations.

For example the kids who are only 12 they are going to be around they city driving. other than that the car itself is a great idea. They are going to help you get your destination faster and you won't be tired. They are going to help you stay out of trouble from the police. They will help you stay at one speed rate and you wont have to worry about getting ticket while on vacation, They will also attract many people to get one. These cars are going to be a worldwide sensational when they come out. Many people will still have doubt on the car when it comes out but when them everywhere they are going to want one.

64FC0AA11F65,"Driverless cars: are they really safe? There are many points to go with the postitive and negative things about driverless cars. Both sides have very important points to make. There are, however, many more negatives than positives. Three negative points that will be discussed in this essay are: driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions and put many people in danger, and there is an increased risk of car crashes if driverless cars are used.

To begin, driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers. If a driverless car were to fail to do a task correctly, that mistake could result in an accident. This accident would then bring up the question, ""who is at fault?"" When this question surfaces, many drivers will blame the car manufacturing company, bringing up the point that the car itself failed and not the driver. When this point is brought up, many car manufacturing companies will have to fight lawsuits and have to appear in court. This court showing would result in a large conflict for the company and for the driver, seeing as many people outside of the issue would take sides. The issue would become a large problem for the world, and would be easily settled if driverless cars were not mad to begin with.

Also, driverless cars would increase the amount of car malfunctions that could happen on the road, resulting in an increased danger when going out on the roads. Driverless cars could malfunction in many ways. For example, they could fail to alert the driver when they need to take over, they could fail to communicate that something is wrong with the car itself, or they could fail to drive correctly. Each of those malfunctions could cause serious problems on the road, and put many people in even more danger than they are already in. Although there are many more malfunctions that could happen with a driverless car, they could all be prevented if driverless cars were not let out on to the streets.

The third point is that driverless cars increase the risk of car accidents. Car accidents happen in many ways. If a driver is distracted, if a car malfunctions, if there is a road block, etc. With driverless cars, many drivers will become more distracted, feeling as though they dop not need to watch the road at all and can do whatever they please. However, that is not the case. With a driverless car, people need to be on a higher alert than they would with a regular car: making sure the car does not malfunction, and keeping an eye out for the worst. If a driver were to become too distracted, they would not be watching the road closely enough, and are putting many lives in danger. If the car were to try and get the driver's attention for assistance through an area the car felt it could not drive through, the driver would be too distracted and the car could crash.

To conclude, there are multiple negative effects driverless cars would have if they were used. Driverless cars would increase the amount of legal conflicts between car manufacturers and drivers, driverless cars would worsen the amount of car malfunctions, resulting in many lives put in danger, and with driverless cars there is an increased risk of car crashes. Driverless cars are a bad idea, and should not be put on the roads. They put many people in danger. Driverless cars: are they really safe?    ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless cars may help keep the people safe and aware of their surrondings but, they encourage people to not pay atention to the road. The driverless cars could put people in danger, could make people careless, and could cause chaos to the laws of the road.

The driverless cars could put people in danger. The writter states, ¨They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves¨ . They are computors that do everything for us. What if they are all programed by the government? What if they are controlling you and you dont even know it? There are situations that are dangerous. Some that computor in a car could not identify it as well as a human could.

If a person is not paying attention to the car, they would put not only themselves into danger but also the people around them.

The driverless cars could make people careless. Many people trust technology too much. GM is even installing the following,

¨driver´s seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object¨.When people rely on technology they tend to not care what happens becuase it was not thier fault. What if a person always relied on those seats to tell them if they were close to an object and one time the techonology failed them. Driverless cars would encourage people to be more careless. People think ¨The car is all under control¨ so they dont pay any attention. Driverless cars will make people feel too secure and they will be careless with their actions.

Driverless cars could cause chaos with the laws of the roads. If people decide to buy a driverless car, they would have to learn the new laws of the road. The writter states, ¨new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accicent¨. There would be choas because some people may still have the driver in the car. There would be so many people following different rules and they all are trying to go their destination. The BMVs will be busy that is for sure. Driverless cars could cause chaos with the laws of the road.

To conclude, businesses like GM and Google realize that they are making money from this idea. But what they dont realize is that driverless cars could put people in danger, could make people more carless than they already are, and could cause chaos with the laws of the road.

FEABB27C1722,"Having driverless cars would be unthinkable. To make a car that humans do not have to drive is just being lazy, if someone has a driverless car they will never pay attention to the road because the car does eveyting for them. In drivers ed the tearcher tells us, our parents tell us, anyone who drives tells us ""ALWAYS BE AWARE OF YOUR SURROUNDINGS"" People would not have to watch anything because they would not be driving the car.

Although not having to drive would be awesome for some people, especially people who are driving long periods at a time, it is still not safe. What happens when an animal runs out in the road unexpectidaly? Does the car just stop by itself? You can never know what will happen if you have no control over it. If a car can drive itself and a human does not have to do anything and the car messes up and does not work when you need it to the most what will happen? You will most likely end up geting hurt.

It would be different if this driverless car was guarenteed to never mess up, but that is not how it is. People who actually drive cars now have issues all the time with their vehicle not working when they need it to the most, sometimes breaks go out, the car may die, there is a whole series of things that could happen. So think about if someone was n ot driving their car and all of a sudden when the car is just driving itself and someone is on the road going somewhere and all of a sudden the car stops working, the ""battery"" dies... What can you do about that? Nothing, your car dies and your are in the middle of traffic, you are in major trouble because you have either caused yourself or someone else to be injured.

Having driverless cars would be completely irresponsible. The reason texting and driving is illegal and drinking and driving is illegal is for saftey purposes. Those two things are major causes of accidents. Having driverless cars is just giving people the go ahead to get in a vehicle irresponsible now. Would you feel safe with your children in a car ansd other people behind the wheel just texting or being intoxicated or both? I know that I would not feel very safe. Cars can stop working whenever they want but if you have someone texting or intoxicated in one of those cars and it stops working, there is no way to prevent your children from getting hurt.

In conclusion, having driverless cars is a terrible idea. They are not 100 percent guarenteed to always work just like regular cars are not but no one driuving a car and it stops working can cause extremely way more problems than a regular car would. With a regular car you can just take over whenever you need to and pull off to the side to prevent problems or do whatever you need to do to keep away from accidents happening, but with no one driving a car you are risking your life and others around you all because you wanted to be lazy and not drive a car by yourself.

B1EE1AC13FEA,"You know how in the old cartoons like the jetsons and etc , fantasize the future with flying cars and travel tubes. I think this is the next step to living like the Jetsons. You can drive your car with out really driving; Who wouldnt like to do that? But with everything thats good theirs always a bad side and their have been many concerns about these new self driven cars. I personally dont think that we are ready for this kind of technology.

"" Something not available to drivers trying to text and drive with a cell phone"" (paragraph 8).

We cant even pay attentions in the cars we have because we are to busy trying to be on our phones 24/7. America alone has had a numerous amount of accidents in the past couple of years and alot of them end in fatality. With a car that you dont have to be focused on 24/7 will probably just make matters worse. America is jsut simply not ready to keep their hand on the steering wheel and off their screens.

""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" ( Paragraph 9). This big what if question, what if the technology forgets to remind the driver that its their turn to drive. What if the system over corrects the car and causes an accident. What if the sensors stop sensing. Their are alot of plausable ""what ifs"" with these cars. Personally, a little bit too many what ifs. These producers should just wait till they can assure most of these issues will never happen. Plus, most of these cars will be so expensive so no one will really be able to drive them in the general population. So a waste of money and product for a car to sit some where in a ware house, rusting away.

The people of America are not ready for these "" Self drivin cars""

to be out on the street. First we have to make sure we can drive without the cars help safetly then go from their. The development on these cars need to be holted until they can assure most of the problems that might occur.

7C9C2DF37B67,"Driverless cars have many postiive and negative effects and ideas that they could have on our world.

The driverless car that Google cofounder Sergey Brin invisions ""would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" (P1)

This would allow for the United States to purchase less fuel and in the end prevent us from spending so much money.

These kind of cars would be a great help to anyone making a long distance trip.

You could begin your trip one day and fall asleep and have driven several hours.

The idea has been tested by many different companies and is still being developed to this day.

Driverless cars would be a great benefit to the people of America, it would allow for people to save money on gas, and not have to worry about crashing because the car would drive itself.

With all of the sensors and other driverless cars, it would seem that the manufacturers could prevent accidents.

I believe that driverless cars could be a great benefit to this country, but they cannot replace all cars with them.

We still need fire trucks and police vehicles to keep people safe, but they would have a great impact on our nation.

One way that some companies are making driverless cars is by using ""smarter roads."" (P3)

General Motors for expample designed a concept car that could run on a special test track.

This track would send radio signals to the front end of the car.

Another way that some companies are trying to make driverless cars are by using sensors.

Google modified a Toyota Prius with ""position-estimating sensors, a rotating sensor, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" (P4)

Google used all of these sensors in different ways to begin to develop their own version of the driverless car.

The driverless car has been attempted by many different companies and each one has their own version with their own flaws.

Driverless cars seem to be a thing of the future, but in reality it could be here before we know it.

With all the different technology and all the money some of these big companies have it is a wonder the driverless car is not invented already.

The different companies have designed driverless cars now that still require the assistance of a driver.

The cars can brake, accelerate, and stop by themselves.

""All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (P7)

This allows for some people to argue that driverless cars are not reliable, and it is not that at all.

Driverless cars have no way of knowing what to do in a situation like that.

The smart thing is to have the driver take over in that spot and would prevent a potential accident.

The problem with this is that the car needs some way of notifying the driver if he falls asleep.

Some designers have thought to use a vibration in the seat to alert the driver.

The Google car for example has a voice that announces when the driver needs to take over.

""Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays."" (P7)

One big argument when it comes to driverless cars is the potential for an accident.

The worry is that if the technology in the car quits working and the car crashes, who do you blame?

To me it seems like the manufacturer should be blames since they designed the car with the technology that failed.

The driver had no control over the technology, he just had to wait until the car needed his assistance.

This argument is one of many when it comes to driverless cars and it is an important one.

If the car crashes somedbody has to get blamed and if the driver is not actually driving why would he get blamed.

This could be one debate that pushes back the release of the driverless car until someone comes up with a compromise.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless cars would be a great benefit to our country as a whole.

I assume and hope that a company will release a driverless car in the next few years to allow me to experience such a thing.

It would be like a roller coaster.

You do not know how you are going to get where you are going and do not know how bumpy the ride will be but it will be an adventure.

That is what intrigues me the most about driverless cars, the adventure that is coming.

""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" (P10)

This just makes me even more excited for the release of driverless cars, it could happen in the next 4 years.

A driverless car would be a great invention and would allow the United States to make money if they were able to produce it and sell it.

Driverless cars are coming to us soon and they are going to excite many people because of the technology put into it, and also the seemingly magic wayt hat it drives you.

A0EFA34CCD99,"Driveless cars are an excellent idea. In the article it says that the cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis, and would offer far more flexibilty than a bus. There are many complications when it comes to driving any type of car. You hear a lot about car accidents, deaths, injuries and much more. What they are trying to do is create a safer car. I think this is a great thing because we would be using less fuel, the driver would be more focused, and it will make driving safer.

Everyday we go through so much fuel to get around. We are hurting the enviroment tremendously, and something needs to be done about it. It seems that it would also be cheaper to drive a smart car. We depend on cars more than anything to get us around, so why not make something that saves us money? People would feel at ease while driving too. However, driveless cars are not completely driverless.

These cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all of the cars are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. This will definatley keep people aware of whats going on around them; new drivers espcially. The smart car will keep you alert at all times; which most normal cars lack today. After a while people get so used to driving that they do not pay attention. This makes the road a dangerous place. GM has created a sensor to let you know when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The seat will vibarte, and the Google car will announce to the driver to take over. Manufacturers are considering using cameras to watch the drivers to see if they are doing what they are supposed to do.

Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, says, ""We have to interpret driving in a new fun way."" Some manufacturers hope to bring information systems that use heads-up displays. In this way, the in-car system is safer, and safety is a big concern. Another safety feature is a special sensor that makes the driver keep hold of the wheel.

With many manufacturers working to improve these cars, and to help make them safe; it will turn out to be a huge step in the world. Smart cars have come a long way. Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. It is amazing how we can make technology, and even better when it has a positive outcome. They should definatley continue improving these cars because of less fuel usage, drivers would be more focused and alert, and it will make driving safer and easier.

253AB1BAC707,"Driverless Cars, something often seen as a fantasy is actually coming true. Driverless Cars are just basically cars that does not require a human driver. This new invention should not be released because it can be a hazard, require more research, and it is not that useful.

This idea has been worked on and tested since 2009, this means that we do not fully understand or know the harmful the new cars can be. In the article it states that, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". This can be harmful to the driver because the driver might not be paying attention, since they depend on the car to drive them. Even though machines can be accurate and precise, it can still have some malfunctions and there is not enough research to know what they are. In paragraph nine it also states that, ""Presently, traffic laws are wrtten with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This shows that the government also sees humans only driving cars.

Although many researchs have already been made, there is still is a long road ahead. Smart Cars requires the use of newer tools and parts. In Paragraph four it states that, ""Google's modified Toyoto Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."". Even though Smart cars is a whole new invention; there are still more research to be done on the parts that are needed to make Driveless cars driveless. Research needs to also be done on how to create the a form to sequire these vital parts of the car.

At the end, Smart cars are not needed. Many people already have their license and are able to drive; there is no point of having a driver, having the risk of not paying attention, sit behind the wheel and let the car drive itself rather than a driver who is driving it themselves.

In the first paragraph it says that, "" He envisions a future with public transportation system where the fleets of driverless cars form a public-ransport of taxi system."". Millions of people's jobs are based on driving, and if driveless cars are released, then millions of people have a risk of losing their jobs.

17E8BB6C550B,"Driverless cars do seem like the thing today's society is pushing for in the future, but is it as good as they say it is? How would one operate such a car? How much could it cost? These are questions that have all been asked before.

""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" Now why pay for a car that can't fully operate itself through such tribulations? If I get a ""driverless car"" I want to be able to go to sleep and wake up parked at my destination.

Driverless cars do seem good in a sense of not being able to drunk drive, unless you put too much gas in the tank. If you know what I mean. On the note of gas, would a driverless car be running on gas or electric? Or both since it would have such high energy usage with all of the cameras. Which would spike up the price dramatically if it was electric and you'd constantly have to charge it.

In my opinion driverless cars are something that do sound fun, but at the same time dangerous. There are certain things that your car wouldn't be able to see that the human eye could. For example, what if somebody's turn signals were out so they had to use their hand. How would the car see that and know to slow down? With that question on the table who would be responsible for that crash?

So in a sense driverless cars are very cool, but seem to be more of a hastle than it's worth. I'd rather just keep both hands on the wheel and move on with life. It's also just lazy, what's the point in having a drivers license if I'm not driving the car?        ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Although this piece of technology, whilst seemingly far away, is now becoming more science than fiction. Google has been working with extreme effort to produce some of the worlds first self driving cars, and they're quickly approaching their goal. This may be great news to some, but to others this is a warning of an automated automoblie catastrophe. This essay is being written to prove to those people that self-driving cars are a beautiful innovation which the modern world definitely needs.

Sergey Brin, cofounder of Google, explains that the driverless cars of the future would use half of the gas that today's taxis use. With the threat of global warming starting to become apparent, fuel consumption is definitely a primary concern with that issue. If global warming doesn't concern anyone, surely paying for 50% less gas is quite a plus then. Another bonus to these cars is that they provide a more comfortable, quiet, and personal experience of travel, rather than any public transportation available. Also, considering that the car would drive itself, this allows the driver to accomplish other tasks like sending email or calling family. Now, some people may be questioning the cars' ability to drive, especially in unusual situations. It's a given that these cars wont originally be flawless, and that they'll need some help along the way. That's why all of these cars go to certain measures to keep the driver attentive of the road incase human assistance is needed. Infact, the cars may eventually have displays that will render cellphones useless because the cars themselves can be used to text, call, etc., thus making them safer than a normal car.

In conclusion, self-driving cars are the way of the future, and they will benefit the realm of transportation in a countless number of ways. Whilst the cars aren't flawless yet, that is no reason to quickly dismiss them as science fiction.

Paragraph 7 states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are not designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This example tells us that we can not fully rely on driverless cars to lead us safely. Paragraph 7 also states, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" From this example we can tell that driverless cars are not alert and road ready if we have to continously check and be alert of any mishap.

Driverless cars not only lack reliability but they also lack safety. Paragraph 9 states, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.""

It is helpful for the car to be able to drive while the parent is taking care of there kids. It's okay to have Google maps and stuff like that to help you out.

Sensors are good because they could help you out when your not paying attention or when something is coming and you dont see it coming. They can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine which can allow the car to slow down quickly.

BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant the car can handle functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the friver keeps hold of the wheel.

Some manufactures hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads up displays. Which can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. In this way, the in-car system is acutally a safety feature.

Driving laws are focus on keeping the driver, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If we have this then, i think that it will help us out. The reason for this is because we wouldnt be focused on reading our texts, or anything like that. We know that our car can drive on its own.

5FFC25FE5E00,"I am against driveless cars for many reasons. The first reason being that there is a high posiblity of getting into a wreck. Your car might not see an animal or a person walking the streets and you might not have enough time to turn it back to manual so that you can swerve away from it. Driveless cars can also be very scary in my opinion, I mean, we are so use to driving, we might accidently forget it is driving itself and get freaked out of scared.

Another reason is the technology could mess up at any moment. What if your car ran into a puddle? Would that affect your car at all? It might not but I wouldn't want to that that chance. I also would feel as though whoever else is in the car with me, or on the streets, would be in danger if I let the car drive.

I just don't think driveless cars are very safe. What if the car glitches and won't let you take control? You could not only putting yourself in danger, but others as well. I also think it would be creepy having a car watch me while I'm driving. What if i parked to the side and had to change real quick? Would it see anything? I sure hope not!

On an ending note, I think that driveless cars sound like an amazing idea but they probably would take 10 years to make perfect.

0F5879D60008,"Driverless cars have many advantages and disadvantages. A few advantages are easier transportation for older people, handicapped and mentally challanged, also there will less accidents once the cars are completely driverless. Some disadvantages are how expensive the cars are with all the new technology and mechanics all around will have to learn an entirely new method of fixing cars.

The transportation of older people, the handicapped and mentally challanged will be one of the greatest triumphs. Once a person gets old, their senses deteriorate causing them to drive slower and possibly cause accidents. With the handicapped it will give them the feeling of driving again, more so with people who have lost their ability to walk and can not transport themselves. Finally, with the mentally challanged, they will experiance driving themselves without causing danger to other people and will not have to completely rely on their parents or care taker to tote them around everywhere. With the driverless cars, the new technology will make it safer for these types of people to get around and still have others around be safe as well.

On the other side of the spectrum though, there are many disadvantages to having driverless cars. One being, the cars will be very expensive, they have so much new technology that goes into them and so many safety features. The price will set many back from trying to buy one and what would be the use if only the people who did not need them, had them? Next, many mechanics will have to learn a brand new method of fixing driverless cars, more so all the types of sensors and trackers. The learning process can take many months to someone who needs it fixed right now and will set many other from trying to be a mechanic.

To end off with, there will be fewer accidents once driverless cars are all around. The sensors will take away the need for the driver to stopgo and yeild to tother vehicles and pedestrians. This will be a big leap from how many accidents we have each year and revent untimely deaths. This is also big for people who text and drive or drink and drive. The risk for drinkers and texters is greatly reduced if not prevented from driverless cars.

Finally, the driverless cars has multiple advantages as well as multiple disadvantages. many advantages are old people, hanicapped, and mentally challanged have a way to get around and fewer accidents.

I didn't mention about people that will lose their job to these driverless car what can you do about this the money that they get and feed their family are you going to snatch their job away and let them starve to dead just so you can sell your driverlesss car.

By the way what will happen if your main computer that command your driverless car error or overheated is that mean all the traffic will be shutdown and you cannot do any thing until you fix that

The last thing i will mention about is the signal that you sent back and forth from the car to the gps or the controller how can you control the car when there is a place that got a bad signal right now some place you can't even get a good signal with wifi then how can you do that with all this driverless car system

BAA2FB2B6335,"There are many things that the world can benefit from by having driverless and smart cars. Deaths caused by car accidents, reckless, and drunk drivers would not be as high as they are now if we had driverless and smart cars. The amount of gas usage would not be as high as it is, becuase most people would not even need it. People would not have the stress of worrying about crashing into others cars or things. A car being a smart car, knowing when things are getting dangerous, and knowing not to crash into things would be also very beneficial for beginners and drivers who are paranoid about driving. Driverless and smart cars could really change the way the world works when it comes to cars.

I think driverless cars would be safer for the world. When people die by car it is usually because of the reckless and drunk drivers behind the wheel. Now sometimes you can not control the way a person drives and also acccidents happen. With smart and driverless cars you have less things to worry about when it comes to things like accidents. I feel as if driverless cars would really help contribute to the stopping of all the unnecessary deaths cause by reckless and drunk drivers.

In 2013 BMW developed a car that was called a

"" Traffic Jam Assistant "". That car could handle functions at speeds up to 25 mph. It could accelerate, steer, and brake for itself. Even though the car did all of those things, it still notified the person behing the wheel when they needed to pay attention to the road ahead. I feel as if a car that is able to do that is wonderful and very beneficial to drivers and pedestrians. Being that people have already started developing these types of cars, I think that they should go on with making them better and safer for the world to have.

Driverless and smart cars are things that just shows how well we have advanced with technology. Driverless and smart cars should continue to be developed and made even better in differnt ways. Why not take advantage of new techonology, and use it in a good way. Driverless and smart cars are bound to be great in years to come.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
76C5B28AB007,"Driverless cars may be coming in our future, but they most likely will not be commonly used. Driving a car run by a computer allows a number of problems to occur. Since 2009, driverless cars have been around. These cars are only considered driverless under certain conditions though. If the car is not reliable in all traffic conditions, people should not rely on them to get them where they need to go safely.

Society today relies on technology and computers for almost everything from talking to friends to sending military signals hundreds of miles. At times, even the most advanced technology glitches. Driving a car that is controlled by technology would pose the same problems. Would the car still drive if it started raining? What would happen if the rotating sensor on the roof glithched? A driver, assuming the car is driving, may not be attentive and see the signal given by the car for the human to take over. The car could crash causing even bigger problems than just faulty technology.

Crashes occur even when human drivers are in control of the car. It is inevitable that crashes are likely to happen in the autonomous cars as well. Paragraph 9 states that, ""in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" If these driverless cars are better than having a human behind the wheel, most states would allow them to be tested. Even if they were tested and allowed to be driven new laws would have to be put into place. In the case of an accident, would drivers or manufacturers be at fault for the accident? Drivers might claim that they did not see the signs that the car gave them signifying that the human was supposed to take over. Manufacturers would argue saying that the driver was unattentive to their surroundings.

Drivers who rely on computer driven cars may loose the skills needed to drive a car over time. If they do not drive in favorable conditions, because the car is driving, how will the manufacturers expect them to be able to drive in hazardous conditions. Practice makes perfect; without practice, a driver will not be close to perfect. Switching to cars being driven by humans in times of unstable conditons could potentially cause more accidents.

Driverless cars might sound like a fantastic idea. When the different risks are taken into consideration, a human life should be more important than not having to drive. The reliability of the autonomous cars is not strong enough at this time to be considered safe. Humans should keep driving cars and computers should stick to sending text messages.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4AFD5F644AB8,"The idea of an autonomous car is very interesting but it should not be developed into an actual product. Though there are a few luxuries that come with an autonomous car there are quite a few more liabilities that come with it. The following are just some of the issues that could come up with the driverless car.

The first issue that could come about with these driverless cars is their reliance on absolute perfect conditions. The cars that they have tested needed to be put on a special test course to be used. These roads were nearly perfect roads unlike the roads that we drive on every day. To make this car street legal they would have to make major upgrades to the current roads and that would be way too expensive for the government to do. This is just too expensive to be a feasible idea.

The next issue that may possibly occur is legal disputes. If a car is not being controlled by the human inside of it and it crashes in to another car who is at fault for the wreck? That question will lead into a lot of legal disputes involving the cars if the technology fails. There will be owners who blame the manufacturer for the wreck because they made the technology that failed. They could also blame the driver in the car because they were not paying enough attention to take control of the car and prevent the accident from happening.

The third and final issue is the fact that the cars are not truly driverless. These cars are advertised as self driving cars but in reality they still require a driver. This will problems because if the technology fails and does not alert the driver when they need to to control of the car it could lead to accidents and possibly even deaths. Even if the technology does not fail the slightest of delays when sending a warning that they need to take control of the car could result in an accident or maybe even death. This ties in with the previous point about the legal liabilities that come with the driverless cars.

Overall the autonomous cars are a fascinating idea and one that many people may support but in reality they are a legal liability and they would cost a lot of money and possibly cause accidents or even deaths due to a failure or delay in the cars system that lets the driver know when to take control of the car.

67CFABBBAEBD,"Yes i am aginst these driverless cars because anything can happen at any certain time like what if the car doesnt alert you if car is coming to close to you or if you are about to get into a crash , You could end up losing your life and they wouldnt know if the car failed or not or if it was just you who did something wrong and the manufacturer would seriously have to deal with some big problems if the car was part of the reason why that person died .

Other reasons why i am against driverless cars is that they dont seem that safe just because you tested just that ONE car doesnt mean any other car you make cant mailfunction either , there is ONLY five known places that are lleagal where you can actally test a driverless car that means every other state or country doesnt mean its safe because its illeagal , I wont believe it till i see its safe because many things could go so wrong , Like what if the car doesnt alert you in time when your trying to back up and you hit a car that would cause serious problems . Also what if there is a crash is about to happen and the car is coming straight towards you and the car alerts you to late what will happen then ? . You could end up dead because the car didnt alert you in time .These cars could aslo be very expensive not everybody could afford one because people are struggling ALOT , the only people who could really probably afford these are millionaires and other RICH people in the world . Even big brand name car comapines like BMW , GM , Mercedes-Benz , Audi , Nissan and even google even though they are not car company they just want to be the first ones to make a driverless car . Those big name brand car companies say that there will be driverless cars by 2020 which is about four years away from now but any thing can happen within fours years .

Nothing will change my mind about these cars unless i have proof that they can make these cars safe and affordable for people even though the JUST ONE car is millions but there main priority should be about the safety for people and they should ATLEAST make a back up system for the car incase something bad happens or if the car loses cointrol they should atleast make a way to make the car to automatically shut off or stop . so they should really stop worring about the design of the car and start worring about peoples safety.

The driver might not feel or see when the car is trying to get them to pay attention because it needs human feautures. I believe that driverless cars should not happen.

If somebody had a driverless car they would probably not be paying attention at all. They could be on their phone the whole time or who knows maybe even taking a nap. If the car needs them for their human features and their not paying attention then most likely they won't be able to assist the car with their human features.

Diverless cars could cause more accidents. The car could have a malfunction and go crazy. If they need the human features and the human isn't paying attention then that cauld cause an accident. I think driverless cars are a really bad idea. The risks of them causing more accidents are very high; and the risk of the human not paying attention is very high also.

In my opinion I think driverless cars are not good for the safety of other humans. I think that driverless cars will be more harmful to all of us. Diverless cars have so many hazards that everybody needs to be aware of. Maybe if they work out some of the kinks, like it needing human features; then maybe it wouldn't be so bad.

06D27EBDA15B,"Do I support driverless cars or am I against driverless cars? Although in the passage, they talk about positive aspects of creating a driverless car, I do not agree in the making of them. Many consequences can come to play when manufactoring and purchashing these cars. I am against the development of driverless cars because, in my opinion they are a waste of time and a waste of money.

First of all, there can be a technology malfunction. When the development of the generic car is happening, the car gets tested to make sure that it is safe enough and won't be dangerous to the passengers. Putting more expensive technology into a car can be dnagerous and even deadly. Everyday technology even fails sometimes such as; celular devices, computers, kitchen appliances, even cars that already have a touch of technology.

What make you think that a car with more technology is safe for you. How can a diverless car be proven to be safe enough to trust a person's life. If an accident were to happen, due to a technology malfunction, what will the developers and the ""driver"" use to defend their case with. It is to risky to make a car with so much technology involved.

Second of all, what if an incident did happen? Whose fault would it be? If it were a normal case, with a normal car, it would be more simple to say which person to blame because both people would be driving. If technology was involved in the incident and it was a malfunction, it would be the driverless passenger. Then that passenger would bring up the developers as the one to blame. The develpoers have more money and more power than the person who bought the car. So they're going to do anything to not be the ones to blame.

Lastly, it is very expensive to keep up with such a luxury car. The parts would be more expensive. The development would be way more expensive. Where are they going to get all that money? How much would it be to purchase one? What if you get into a wreck? How much will it be to get everything fixed? All unanswered questions that people will ask when they're in that situtation. All those problems can be avoided by simpily buying a car with not as much technology in its interior.

In conclusion, I disagree with the development of driverless cars. They would be very unsafe. It would be more difficult to figure out who to blame for the accidents if they were caused by a driverless car passenger. And it would be very expensive. Other people would be exulted knowing that they dont have to drive, but keep in mind that a trip to the market, could cause you your life.

Driverless cars can help decrese car accident rates as i mentioned earlier. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it says in paragraph two "" Google has had cars that could driven independent under specific conditions since 2009."" These cars has driven more than half a million miles WITHOUT a crash, then again Google cars havent truly been driverless.

The article says, ""they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" This proves that driverless cars are not driverless at all. They still need the driver to be alert at all times. The article also points out that all the cars that have been made are not completly driverless. The article says,"" In fact none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.""

Driverless cars are not really much safer. These cars cannot handle many of the road tasks on there own. They cannot navigate through roadwork or accidents. The google car can drive independently but under specific tasks. There are senors that can make driverless cars much safer but they require the driver to have hands on the wheel at all times.

58A8BDB13078,"Driverless Cars Are Coming

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" there are alot of good facts and opinions for the people who are for the project and also against.

In that case i will have to choose the side that is for the project of making Driverless Cars.

In my opinion i think that if we had Driverless Cars we wouldnt have to worry about having to pay for tests or classes in order to drive cars because you wouldnt need to drive if there were Driverless cars.

Also in my opinion Driverless Cars would help the envirement because it would use about half as much as cars would with an individual driving it manually as stated in Paragraph 1, Senctence 4 "" The cars he(Sergey Brin) foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"".

As I said before I am for the project of making Driverless Cars.

I honestly would enjoy not having to drive around everywhere and just be able to relax on my way somewhere or on a trip.

Also it is kind of like you would have your own personal driver.

I would invest into this project because i think it could really help the community and the people because everyone struggles to get places and it is very hectic.

In that case if we had Driverless Cars we wouldnt have to worry about it being hectic because it would all be calm and everything would have order.

Also there would be a sudden decrease in deaths due to car accidents or road rage.

Having Driverless Cars would decrease deaths because there wouldnt be anymore drunk drivers, or drivers that do drugs or any kind of products that cause hallucinations or cause problems for the drivers to see.

There wouldnt be anymore deaths or accidents caused by drivers on there phones or texting while driving because they wouldnt have to drive anymore the car would drive to where they need to go for them.

That way people can use there phones to call or text who ever they need to while keeping everyone safe from accidents because they are not the ones driving the car it is driving itself.

People should really consider on being for this project of making Driverless Cars, Instead of being against it.

I mean yeah there is gonna be a few problems in the begining of the making of the Driverless Cars.

So in that case once they make the cars they can see what is wrong and how they can fix it so it doesnt happen anymore.

Then everything will be fine and all they have got to do is do a little bit of Trial and Error.

People dont understand that if we have Driverless cars that things would be so much easier, Because we dont have to worry about any danger coming from people behind the wheel of a car.

So that means no accidents or death or having to be worried about someone causing a wreck for wreckless driving or failure to controll the vehicle.

Yes it might put some people out of jobs but look at how much good it would do for out planets air by using less fuel.

Also look at how there would be no accidents or deaths from driving.

Therefore there wouldnt be a need for state troopers or having to get unwanted speeding tickets or tickets for driving in general. it would be less money for court systems, the Federal Goverment, also less money for people to have to pay if they recieved a ticket.

Also it would droop the rates on taxes because the goverment wouldnt need to pay state troopers or cops that watch for laws being broken that apply to driving a vehicle.

So people would have less things to pay and they could put that money towards their kids education.

This would allow more kids to goto college and future their education.

meaning more jobs would be created and alot more people wouldnt be poor or homeless because they wouldnt need to pay as much taxes or have to pay insurance on a vehicle or even have to pay money to own one. Therefore it would drop the rates on people being homeless and poor.

Also it would put more kids in school

So this is why i am for the project of making Driverless cars.

In my opinion i just think it would help out a lot more things than make things worse.

I believe it would help more than anything because we wouldnt have to worry about a lot of stuff with vehicles.

So this is my argument against the people who believe that we shouldnt have Driverless Cars. I believe it will do more good than harm that is why i am for this project to make Driverless Cars instead of against it.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Not only can we not trust the cars but we can not trust us humans. As said in paragraph 8, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? ""

Everybody is different and will react differently or not react at all to the signals letting us know when it is our turn to drive.

Until there is more signals that will help every indivudual , no one should be driving driverless cars.

What happens if a car malfunctions? You can not always trust the makers of the cars. Malfunctions and recalls can be rare but happen often. Cars are not always coded properly. What happens if the engineering code messes up and drives you somwhere else or into a ditch?

Driverless cars will also benefit the environment due to the little gas they consume. Finally driverless cars will benefit those who are not in the shape to drive. The technology of driverless cars helps more than it hurts.

First of all, there are too many problems when it comes to driving. Some are minor and some are major. When you introduce driverless cars to the road, many of the problems will be easily solved. Some drivers are stupid and aren't very aware of their surroundings while driving. They make lousy mistakes like running into mailboxes, running stop signs, and even crashes. When driverless cars are involved you are less likely to get into an accident. All commutes will be more efficient, and there'll be less accidents out on the road.

We all know that money plays a major role in everyone's lives. People try to save as much as they can and it will be easier to do that with driverless cars. These new cars will consume less gas, which will allow you to avoid spending all your hard earned money on just traveling. It isn't just money you're saving but also the environment. Using less gas means less fumes that are getting into the atmosphere. Pollution will be less of a problem, allowing us to live healthier lives.

Its ineveitable that people drive their cars even when their not supposed to, when their drunk, tired and even on drugs. When these types of people get behind the wheel, you're not going to expect anything good from it. So driverless cars not only benefit those who aren't in shape to drive, but also those who were first at risk of danger. Less DUIs will be given to wreckless driver, assuring others on the roads more security. No more innocent people will become victims of dangerous driving.

Driverless cars will be the next big innovation of our daily lives. They prevent drivers from making mistakes on the road which lead to bigger problems. Driverless cars also saves the consumer's money by being more fuel efficient, and saving the planet.

This response will side with the argument of being against driverless cars. This is for the following reasons; driverless cars promote less disciplined actions with not only adults but with teen drivers. Second, automated cars would not benefit the economy, it would damage it even further. Finally automated cars put safety features at risk compared to having an abled-human to do the driving functions manually.

Driverless cars can promote less disciplined actions among teen and adult drivers. This assumption is made because, driving under the influence, as well as underage drinking are huge topics of discussion in today's society. Driverless cars would give these two groups of people an exscuse to commit these actions. They would no longer have to worry about the reproccutions of such crimes. Such as putting other's lives in danger or getting caught by the police.

Automated cars would not benefit the economy in any way. In fact, the cars could worsen the already bad financial situation America faces now. This is because of the following quote from the article. ""Originally, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" ""These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" These direct quotes further express to society that these automated cars require very new, very expensive roads.

Lastly, driverless cars put saftey features at risk compared to having an able-bodied human to do the functions instead. ""Most driving laws focus on kepping drivers, passnegers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This quote speaks entirely for itself.

A2A7F6E809E0,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is a great article and makes a lot of great points about this product. My opinion on driverless cars is I think it's a great idea. Also there could be a down side to this product as well.

A public-transportation taxi system that use half the fuel of today's taxis would be a great idea. It would be great for the environment, as well as us as people. This system woul for sure change the world. The Google cars that work independantly have driven half a million miles withough a collision. Which is great because there goes a lot of injured people and totalled cars that people need as transportation. At the same time, these cars still need a human to operate them under certain conditions such as, puling in and out of places, driving through construction places or car accidents. The idea of the cars running on a track is a grea tidea as well, but there is just no time to fix all these roads to make our cars driverless. Also the cost of this would be too expensive. Also if the car could opperate on its own, I would think that the driver would be even more careless than they already are and would pay even less attention. If the car would still need the driver to be alert in case of needing to take over, drivers would just be more tempted to look away and do other things while driving, and then if the car needed the driver to take over they will have already crashed because the driver was distracted by something else. In my opinion driverless cars is a goof idea in some ways, but in other ways they are dangerous. They are nice to have, but only if you are able to be responsible with them. You need to be able to have self dicipline to be able to operate a car like this and stay alert even if the car is driving for you. Anything can happen in a split second. A plus side to them would be if you are someone that works in the city and always has to sit and wait in rush hour, then this would be a good car for you to have. The car would drive for you in this mess, so you wouldn't get so tired of it. But something that I would worry about personally is trusting the car to do it's job. It is a machine, it could malfunction and make a mistake. Like if it doesn't stop when the rest of the traffic does and it rear-ends someone. Or it doesn't go when the rest of the traffic does and someone rear-ends you. It could be dangerous, and the car messing up like that would't be the buyers fault, it is just still something I would worry about as a driver of a driverless car.

The points made in this article are very helpful to understand the progress being made with driverless cars. They would definitely benefit us in the future, and make car pileups a thing of the past.       ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
DA097BA1D794,"I agree with the idea of ""driverless cars.""

I agree with this becuase it could cause a lower number in people drinking and driving.

This project could also be a whole lot safer.

Machines are only as smart as the human making them.

So there could be flaws and mishaps that can occur, but through trial and error we can fix those problems and perfect the car.

The idea of driverless cars can be dangerous in the matter of if something goes wrong and the driver is not alert it would cause an accendent.

When I read this passage i thought to myself.

With a driverless car I could go to sleep while I go to my destination.

Then I read that the car will alert drivers in situations that the car cannot handle.

the creators should fix this issue so that drivers dont have to still pay 100% attention to the road and the driver could relax.

The idea of driverless cars can be a whole lot safer too.

Mostly because if car accendints are caused by humans, a car can fix this problem.

Like in the passage they used sensors to see around the car to help navigate through traffic.

I agree with the idea of driverless cars because it would be safer.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
7E20F422A3EB,"After reading ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", driverless cars seem to sound theoretically pleasing, however in reality, are a bad idea and should not be continued to develop. These driverless cars have multiple, negative aspects that outweigh the positives, including a major precaution, saftey. They also take away from the driving experience, and add to the dependency on technology.

First of all, the article enters with ""Google cars aren't truly driverless."" This shows how driverless cars are not even at the level of functioning alone without the driver being alert, defeating the purpose of the ""driverless"" car since a human would always have to be present in case something went wrong. Something that manufactures attempted to do was to have ""smart-road systems"", but they ""required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This proves that the costs for the modified roads would be too much to fit the driverless car's needs, so that idea for using the cars would not work. The articles says the cars need ""a whole lot of sensors."" Later, it describes the multiple sensors and states ""the combination of all this input is necesary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This proves that the costs would probably increase due to the new technology as well as the variables that could go wrong increases as the amount of new sensors increase. All of the senors could not mimic the skill of the humans because everything can be constantly changing, from the condition of the roads to the weather. Others might argue, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own,"" however, manufacturers are not at that point of high level saftey and can never guarentee one hundred percent safety. Furthermore, driverless cars can ""steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" This again describes how driverless cars will never be driverless. ""The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" ""This necesitiates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs."" This illustrates how unsafe the driverless cars would be. Any mishap to a sensor or system control could result in terrible consequences. Since the cars would be using new technology, it would be unreliable, because technology tends to fail often. This failure could result in injury or even death, a risk that people should not take. In addition, not only are the cars unsafe, but they also prevent drivers from having fun while driving or getting the full experience. ""Some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays,"" which are more things that can distract the driver. This would create drivers that rely on technology, and if something went wrong, they would not know what to do. Later, the article informs readers that ""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This is because most states know driverless cars are not safe. To account for these new cars, laws would have to change. ""If traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident,"" adding to the trouble of making these cars a possibility and possible conflicts that could arise. When asked in the articule, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer,"" this question highlights the position that driverless cars should not be developed. When describing the production of these cars, manufacturers are all about technology. However, technology is bound to fail at times and can be flawed, especially in the beginning process. As techonolgy increases, risks are increased which can be applied to the cars, since more systems would be added. Instead of developing these cars, manufacturers should look to improving the cars produced currently, such as making them more eco-friendly. Cars already have some sensors that aid and assist the driver, but could not take the place of a real human at the wheel.

Overall, the development of driverless cars should not progress. Due to saftey factors, technology failure, costs, and possible liability issues, driverless cars should not be produced. There are too many risks that could go wrong due to a system malfunction. Humans should not need to be dependent on technology in order to drive. Driverless cars could not replace a human dealing with everyday, constantly changing driving conditions and unexpected events. The cars could attempt to mimic human skills, but would not meet them.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
CE3DBEAAEAA8,"There are both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Though I believe why change what's not broke; there are many people out there who believe driverless cars are the future.

The positive aspects of driverless cars are as follows: there are sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes: these sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids, these vehicles have a traffic jam assistance to signal to the driver that it is time to take over to navigate work zones and accidents, they can steer, accelerate, and break themselves.

The negative aspect of the driverless cars are as follows: more laws would have to be created in ensuring whose liable for the accidents as well as keeping people safe, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars in many states, and to ensure the safety of pedestrians and drivers, traffic lawa will change and not just regular laws and least, they are dangerous.

6CA3EC0D0FC8,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. How do i feel about driverless cars? I am against driverless cars for many reasons. First, safety will always be a huge concern, especially if the driver is not the one driving the car. In addition, the production of driverless cars would cost alot so it might come out of the tax payers money. Finaly, I believe that the driverless cars will never be completely driverless

For a driverless car to be a good idea and be suitable for everybody, it needs to be completely safe for everybody. In the article, the author tells us that most driving laws focus on keeping the drivers, the passengers, and the pedestrians safe. We all know that safety is the most important way, but what is the best way to keep the drivers, the passengers, and the pedestrians safe? The author tells us that lawmakers already know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. How are the drivers going be alert when they are in a drivetless car. What if there is a system malfunction? What if the driver falls asleep while the car is driving itself? The outcomes don't look good. The author asks us a very good question. He asked, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" There will people suing the companies because they expected the driverless car to be a safe car and be able to drive itself because it's a driveless car. This would affect the buyers and manufacturers in a negative way. The production of driveless cars and the cost to buy driverless cars would cost alot. This would also affect the buyers and the manufacturers in a negative way. Finally, even if there was to be a driverless cars, it would not be completely driverless. This would cause concern for the manufacturers and the buyers.

It is true that driverless cars can benefit people, but it can also bring danger and concerns. I am against the development of driverless cars. First, safety will always be a concern. Driverless would not be completely safe because safety is best achieved with alert drivers. The drivers would not be completely alert if they were in a driveless car. In addition, the production and the cost to buy driverless cars would be high. This would cause problems for the manufacturers and the buyers.

A57180863D6C,"Have you ever wondered whst it'd be like to always have a ride to places? The thought of one person sitting in a car alone and not having to drive to reach their destination sounds pretty luxurios to me. Ther have been, and will always be debates over the existance of driverless cars. Everyone knows that, in a car, safety is always the most important thing. I honestly believe that driverless cars can be made safe if they aren't already, and they should most definately be seen on the road in a few years.

Like I stated earlier, safety is the most signifigant quality in an automobile. as stated in passage number nine, ""most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passangers, and pedestrians safe"". I'm pretty sure most of the manufacturers making these driverless cars are aware of this also. The googlr cars have been driving themselves since 2009 without an accident. The thing is mainly that the driver should still be alert, and ready to take over in a dangerous situation. Manufacturers are working towards this problem being solved in a few years.

Also, these self driven cars would use less fuel. In passage number one, it states that google founder Sergey Brin forsees driverless cars using half the fuel of today's taxis. This would make the automobile more efficient, and economical. I hear people everyday complaining about not being able to go places, because of the lack of fuel they are able to afford. Well if half today would be full in the future, than what is there to worry about. Go out, have fun, do as you please.

Lastly, but most definately not least, with driverless cars it would be almost impossible to get lost. In driverless cars there would be an internal GPS that knows where it is going. Also, constant updates would notify of any roadwork or detours. The possibility of just typing an address, and just relaxing as you go about your driverless trip certainly sounds satisfying. The endless road trips and vacations would be fantastic.

In my closing, driverless cars in afew years could become safer than human skilled driving. Having to pay less for gas is always a good thing, and never getting lost in places you don't know makes you more confident to go more places. Driverless cars can really change the world with all of the ideas and things that come along with them. The possibilities are endless, and simply fantastic. I almost can't wait to see what can happen in just a few years.                             ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

There is something being bettered everyday, and in this case, it's cars! The cars of the future or also known as the ""Driverless Cars"" have been on road since 2009 and have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Different methods/techniques have been tested in the direction of the development of future cars, such as cables embedded in tracks that send radio signals to receivers in front of cars, magenets with alternating polarity, the list is never-ending. Although these automobiles have been driving to near perfection, there's always room to improve.

The prompt asked us to give our induvidual point of view on the ""Driverless Cars"", and in my opinion they're great, but like I said previously, they, just like everything thing else needs improvement. The cars have drove for nearly seven entire years on a perfet track record of zero crashes and that's pretty darn good. The thing about the automobiles is that they're not completely driverless, the cars need a person active while the car's active. That was a brilliant idea i thought, having an active person at the wheel while the car was on the road is so much more safe than to have a person in the backseat (theoretically) while the car is in motion. Adding up all aspects of the car, it's features, and feats, I say its a tremendous step in the technology world and I believe it will thrive in the modern world. There's nothing wrong with trying something new and especially if it has something to do with things people use eveyday.

The ""Driverless Cars"" will be great in the future and are perfect now, knowing that they've yet to crash or have an accident. Having cars that can drive pretty much by itself is a tremendous step, having those on the road would be a major feat to overcome. The Driverless Cars make the future safer and less expensive.

7241A8C1844F,"Driverless cars are good and bad for us human beings. Here are three good reasons and three bad reasons. Three goood reasons are: the person in the car desnt have to worry about driving, the person in the car doesnt have to worry about texting and driving, and also the seats vibrate whenever the car is in reverse or vibrates to let you know your about to hit something. Three bad reasons are: the cars can malfunction and cause serious damage to the car and the person in it, the brakes can automatically stop working and cause serious damage to the car and the person in it, and in the passage it did not say whether the car had a GPS system or not so how would the car know where were going.

I am with the Driverless Cars because we dont have to pay any money for them It's like a taxi. They let us know when were to close to another car when backing up, they accelerate, steer, and brake themselves. It also saves fuel.

I am not with the Driverless Cars because they can easily malfunction and put a adult/child in danger. It doesnt have a childs lock for children under 7, the brakes can easily be tampered with and stop working automatically, so therefore if the brakes were to be tampered with and the car was still going it could put an adult/child in serious danger.

DFF14B9DA264,"Though driverless cars may be a thing of the future, my vote is a no. Driverless cars are a bad idea no matter who is behind the wheel. Not only are the drivers put at risk but other people on the roads are put in grave danger when a human is not controlling the vehicle. Driverless cars may appeal to the younger generation because of the flahy technology but the lack of safety tips the scales towards the negative side.

A driverless car's name portrays the idea that humans do not need to be in control of the car that idea is incorrect. Drivers must stay allert and focused while in a driverless car. This is evident when the text states,""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (7) This is concerning because people today tend to get distracted while driving a normal car. If the actual driving factor is taken away, drivers could get distracted by almost anything from technology to falling asleep. This would result in serious fatality to not only th person behind the wheel but to people around them.

In addition, the new entertainment systems in a car may be a new and alien experiance, they point to a rough road ahead. In an attempt to get the driver to pay attention while driving a driverless car, entertainment systems may be inserted in the car. This is pointed out when the text says,""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" (8) Though these systems may keep the driver engaged, when it is time to take over the shift from watching or listening to a system to driving a car may take an extended period of time. The driver would also need to gain a sense of where he or she is while driving in order to take control. This would result in an increase in accident on the road.

No one is perfect and accidents do happen but in a driverless car who is to blame? This issue could cause serious law cases and court battles over injuries or damages indured in a crash with a driverless car. The article suggestd this when the text says,""If the technology fails and someone is inhured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" (9) Not only does the confusion on who is to blame take immense time, it sucks thousands of dollars from the participants in a law suit. Though the court may rule otherwise, the accident could be a result of malfunctioning technology that can not be pinned to an individual.

On the other hand, driverless cars have multiple downsides, some aspects are clear improvements from automobiles today. The new sensor techology inserted into the driverless cars can improve braking and response to sudden stops. The author includes this in the arguement when they say,""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" (5) This would decrease the amount of damages done to cars from running into or backing over things because the sensors have eyes where the driver does not. The sensors can provide an advantage to safe driving that would not come from any ordinary car.

All in all, driverless cars are unsafe and an illogical invention. The lack of attention that is needed when not driving a car will result in mass accidents and injuries when a driver is needed. Entertainment systems in cars only add to the danger in driverless cars and are unnecessary. Crashes and accidents can not be settled or avenged in court because there is no clear cause to the incident. Though the sensor technology incorporated in the driverless cars gives an advantage for braking and controling the vehicle, the bad outweighs the good in this situation. Driverless cars may be a thing of the future but as of right now, humans are not ready to hit the road without a person behind the wheel.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

One reason that I am against the development of driverless cars is the safety concern. In paragraph nine it explains how these driverless cars are currently unsafe to drive in certain road conditions. These conditions may include pulling in and out of locations, dealing with complicated trafic issues, and navigating through roadwork and accidents. As a result, in almost all states it is illegal to even test driverless cars. There are currently only three states in the country that have ""limited"" use of semi-autonomous cars, California, Nevada, and Florida.

Over the course of the cars history many things have been added and many things have been changed, Adding new and additional features such as a driverless feature seems like a great idea once it is perfected. Tests need to be made so that the car can perform every task over and over again without a mistake. Basically I'm saying the driverless car feature has to be perfect in every way before these cars are put out on the market. Completely driverless cars would revolutionize the world in a great way due to the facts that someone could get a ride if they are in an emergency situation, unable to drive, or just need to multitask on the way to work!

This could happen in the future if companies like Google continue to try to upgrade their driverless cars.

There are many questions like: If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault? If this technology was put into action before it was ready for every possiblity then the blame would fall upon the manufacturer and the government for it's approval. The only cars that are close to completely driverless still require the human to be in the driver's seat and remain focused at all times if needed to take over in certain situations.

In the future more and more people will have this type of car. The reasons to allow driverless cars in the future are like a three-legged stool. I am for the driverless cars because it can prevent car crashes, you still have some control of the car, and you can accomplish tasks in the car.

The first leg on the the stool is it can prevent car crashes. In the passage it says, ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" Also in the passage it explains that there might be an aspect where the car can watch you. If the car can see you are texting it won't let you take over the car. This would reduce the amount of car crashes due to texting and driving. I also think that with the driverless car it would reduce the amount of drunk driving crashes. On the other hand, I can see how peope would be against this they may think it could cause more crashes. For example, what would happen if the car stopped working and didn't alert the driver. The driver may have to idea that the car stopped and easily drive off the road.

The second leg on the stool is you still have some control of the car. The passage says, "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" In areas such as construction zones and accidents the car will alert you and you can take over. The car can alert you by having flashing lights on the windshield or vibrating your seat. I like to know I have some control of my vehicle. This way I know I can take over before it drives me into a ditch or a pond. I can see someone's view that is against this as why would I want a driverless car if I still might have to drive it. The car wouldn't be driverless if you have to drive through constuction zones. This could cause issue because people would want the car to be completely in control.

The third leg on the stool is you can accomplish tasks in the car. If you are running behind on getting something finished for work and you have a half and hour drive there that is a waste of time. With the driverless car you can get your work finished and still make it to work on time. Also, since the car is watching you if you recieve a text you can respond. I feel this will be much safer with all the drivers I have seen that text and drive. On the other hand, someone who is against the driverless car might feel this is unsafe. If the driverless car stops working and the driver is doing something else they won't have time to gain control of the car to stop from crashing.

There are positives and negatives to all things in life. Some things we can't stop from happening. The driverless cars are in our future. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan by 2020 plan to all have a driverless car according to the passage. The reasons to allow driverless cars in the future are like a three-legged stool.

Cars may not be fully driverless in our lifetime, but I believe that eventually it will happen.

Traffic laws for vehicles will be added and removed as the advancement of driverless cars continue.

If one is behind the wheel of a driverless car, they would not want to operate, but rather do something of importance to themself. If the driverless car is put out there, the driver would not want to have to take over, which they would have to at some points of the journey. Most laws are made to provide safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. If the technology and functions behind the driverless car fail and cause injury, whose to say is at fault? The driver or the technology could both be at fault for causing injury. Of course driverless cars would be convenient and better for gas usage, but our technology is not developed enough to pursue driverless cars.

Although driverless cars have been in discussion and worked on for many years, we are not yet ready as a society to begin the idea of letting them on roads. Because of lack in technology developement, safety, lack of testing, and the careless drivers who would be behind the wheel, our society is not ready for this function to be on the road. Yes, the car itself has benifits, but the negatives out weight the positives. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
24B780C7D7C2,"Driverless cars to me are not such a bad idea; however it is also not the brightest idea as well. Me personally I wouldn't want to drive a driverless car because I would not feel safe. Technology is something big in our generation, and even though I love it, I would not want to be in a car I couldn't control myself.

The first reason I am against driverless cars is because of mine, and others safety. People these days are very lazy. Technology does almost everything for us nowadays. If driverless cars become very popular I feel there will be more accidents. People will be texting and driving , and not paying attention to the road. Another big issue for me is falling asleep! Not having to put in so much work when driving the car will make it rather difficult to stay awake. ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that only safe cars has a human driver in control at all times."" Driving a car where you have to do all the work is already hard to stay awake while doing , so why make the job easier by having your car do it for you ?

Some people may be for the driveless cars but in most states they're illegal. Some states are premitted to using semi-autonomous cars, such as : California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driverless cars are not relaible and if they were good cars and one-hundred precent safe they'd be legalized everywhere. Anything can go wrong with driving a driverless car. What if something goes wrong with the car its self; or when its system shuts down and doesnt notify you for all the things that it would if it were on.

Driverless cars are not the best idea ,it may seem cool but if it doesn't forsure keep everyone safe and is not even legalized in all 50 states , it is a bad idea. This is why I am , and will always be against driverless cars.    ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
143749D01266,"Cars are an everyday thing, you need them to get to work, to school, to pick up your kids, but what happens when the cars drive themselves? People have long dreamed of cars that drive themselvs, but most people dont know that google has had them sence 2009. Those cars arent compleatly independent, they need a persion to control them, or rather ""help"" them, like on high trafic areas, or around crashes. there are many advantiges and disadvantiges to the automatic car, but should we have them? Well, there are many reasions we should.

Its no surprize that every single car is as save as phisicly posable. At google, there cars have drove half a million miles without a crash. thats because every car is compleatly loaded with sencers to keep that from happening, let alone the persion in control of the car. another amazing feature this car has is that you can not use the automatic drive without both hands on the wheel, so the driver must pay atenton. That also makes it imposable for texting at the wheel.

Its no secret that aoutmatic cars are the future, with its advanced safty features and its convenence. All this car really needs is suport. Tons of people are compleatly against this idea of cars driving themselvs, but they have no reason to. Its safer, and easyer.

A656ACA2DF15,"In the arcticle it states how driverless cars are in planning and in the process of being made. Technology is increasing every year and I believe by the year of 2020 it will be more advanced than it has ever been. I have to say in my opinion I am against driverless cars.

I have my reasons of why I am against driverless cars.

In the text it states that the driverless cars in the making still require human ability.

I believe that humans should be in control of the car so their is no malfunction.

I would not trust the car driving on its own.

Technonoly is not perfect their are screwups, and one screwup from a driverless car can cost the life of someone.

Driverless cars dont just have cons though they have pros.

One pro is that if someones is drunk they can get in the car and not have to control it and having the risk on getting into a dangerous accident.

According to the text it says that the car system is a safety feature. This can be true, but everyday technology advances, and humans become more and more accustomed to it.

Though technology is a wonderful thing to use and have, I believe that it is also harmful.

Now in this time period we are used to technology doing things for us, this can lead us to not think for ourselves or do things for ourselves.

Back in the old times humans did things for themselves some of the greatest minds of our times changed the world and how we live today but if technology begins to increase and think for us humans wont be able to learn for themselves or experience different things.

Our mind will be closed off from the world.

Our creativity level can decrease.

One thing that most of us go through and experience is driving.

In the text it claims that the cars have navigating systems that will lead the car to go where we want it to without driving.

We wont need our sense of direction or our thinking to solve where to go to get to our destination.

The whole point is we will not use our brains and think for ourselves but we will let technology think for us.

We will not increase our minds in the sense of obtaining more knowledge because we wont know or have a clue of what to do.

We will simply be cut off from learning or experiencing things or situsations for ourselves.

These factors play a major part in day to day life.

59CAD930EF50,"There are two different optionss that could take place when deciding my opinion on driverless cars. I am against driverless cars, for a numerous amount of reasons. So many things could go wrong when having driverless cars around. Car accidents occur every single day, and I don't believe that driverless cars would help this cause. People need to be more aware of their surroundings and pay a lot more attention to the roads when driving. Just like every type of technology today, it's highly possible that these driverless cars won't work properly and malfunction. Driverless cars could ruin our world and harm our lives in so many different ways.

Today's current drivers and cars, already cause car accidents and harm to everyone's lives. If our society were to add driverless cars into the mix, it would be chaos. More people would be getting car wrecks, because they would have a reason to text, eat, talk, and even sleep while driving. These people won't realize that the driverless cars won't work 100%. It is possible that the sensors will not work, and that it is all on them to be aware of their surroundings and be alert to steer the car in the right direction. Any laws against texting and driving, would not help to stop this, because people do not always listen. Almost anywhere, texting and driving is illegal, but even today, I still see people going agaisnt these laws, and causing themselves to get in a crash. Driverless cars will all be going at different speeds, therefore, making everyone more prone to getting into an accident. If these driverless cars were to all go at the exact same speed, it could cause people to be late to certain events. Driverless cars would have so many components to them that they would need to work, so that means that they would use up more energy/fuel. If the driverless cars would need more gas, then that means that gas would be more expensive, which is a huge downside for people. Even now, we are not sure whether these driverless cars would actually work or not, but we also are not sure that if these cars did work, that they will work properly. It is very possible that these cars could malfunction and make the possibility even higher that someone could get into a car accident. There are so many factors that could cause car accidents, when it comes to driverless cars. Today, we already have so many things that could cause people to get into car wrecks, and driverless cars would add to that.

Overall, there are so many factors that could cause car wrecks and accidents, and make everyone question the safety of our people. People should be more alert and aware of their surroundings to prevent car accidents. Driverless cars and their speeds may affect our daily lives, and we are not sure if these cars would actually work.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E85BD864C51A,"First of all,Driverless cars are a great idea to have in the future because it helps prevent alot of accidents and would be cool to have. I think they should do more stuff to the driverless car like add a entertainment center so the driver would be entertained and more people would probably be interested in buying one in the future. Driverless cars would be wonderful to have in the future because they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves without a human having to do anything and it would notify a human driver to take over when the situation requires.

Also, manufactures are considering to use cameras to watch the driver while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver so that the driver is not texting or doing other things while driving, which would prevent accidents or being pulled over and given a ticket. A negative thing about having a driverless car is that drivers would get bored when waiting for their turn to drive. But, some manufactures hope to bring in some car enterainment and information systems so that the driver would be entertained in having something to do when they´re not driving.

Finally, driverless cars would be great to have in the future because it has all this new technology inside that would keep you safe and entertained when you´re not driving. Although, driverless cars has some negative things about it that would need work on but overall, I would reccomend it to people to buy in the future. Also, this specific car would help prevent alot of accidents and deaths from a regular car because a driverless car has a camera to watch what you´re doing so you are safe.

D78CE4181BE8,"I belive the driverless cars are a good idea due to the many reasons I have come to know through reading the passage provided. There are less distractions while driving these cars. Although they are not full driverless cars, they take over most of the driving. It has been shown that with these driverless cars there are fewer wrecks than with our regular cars we are use to driving everyday.

While driving the driverless cars people still have most of the control. When a dangerous or risky situation is approaching the driver is signaled to take control over the car. So the driver does have control during difficult or risky situations. For example like backing out of a driveway or even into one, complicated traffic situations, and even navigating through road work, or accidents. The car only has control in calm situations that may not cause harderous risks.

Millions upon millions of dallars have went into this project not only to manufacture the cars and to make sure they work , but also to fix situations due to the saftey or anything regarding the car. If something is not up to date, or isn't working corectly the engineers are paid to fix it. This causes the driverless cars to be more efficent and safe. Texting and driving is a huge problem with the society we live in today, but if you put thought into it the car can take over driving while you or whoever reply to that text instead of putting peoples lifes at risk. Also, another example would be if your running late and trying to finish getting ready your car could drive while your finishing up.

After reading this passage and inferring some things I have came to the conclusion that driverless cars are not only more convinent but also safer and cause less polution. Driverless cars have had a signifcate difference in wreck numbers than a regular car. As a bonus they give out less polution while driving. Which not only means they're safer for the enviorment, but also safer for peoples lifes. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B8A83BCD30D6,"What if I told you that there were these special kind of cars that didn't require a driver to accelerate, brake, and basically any of the basic car functions? That it was all programmed to do these things? Sounds crazy, right? It may sound crazy, but it's happening. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, has found a way to have cars to do just that. They're called driveless cars. I, personally, think that these cars are a terrible idea, to be honest. There are plenty of positive and negative aspects for these cars though, which I will talk about now.

These driveless cars sound pretty cool, right? They're very extraordinary really. Movies, television and books have imagined this moment for centuries, saying that the future would consist of them. Being ""pretty cool"" is just one of a few positive aspects. Obviously, you wouldn't need to drive, so if you got tired or bored, you could just be fine (under certain conditions, which I will discuss later). These cars also would have more flexibility than a bus and using half of the fuel needed for a taxi cab. That's a big deal with gas prices rising lately.

There's really only one negative aspect to these cars, but it's a pretty big one. You didn't think it would be perfect, did you? Everything has a flaw or twelve to it. That negative aspect is that you have to stay alert the entire time that you are driving. Yes, it is a driveless car, which is supposed to mean that you don't have to drive. That statement is only half true. The car is specifically made to do the basics, like accelerate, brake, turn, and other stuff. But, say there is an accident or an animal in the road. You'd have to turn out of the way so that you can get out of the way of it. They're not programmed to do so on their own. You have to do that. But, on the bright side, if for some reason you're not paying attention to the road, there is a car assistant programmed the car system. It would alert you of when you need to take control of the car to move out of the way, or something along those lines.

As you can tell, these ""driveless cars"" have some perks to them, but they also have some disadvantages to them as well. I still stick with my opinion of not having these cars though. It's not that much work to move your hands to steer a wheel and to push your foot down on a pedal to make it go and stop. The negative aspects weigh out the positive aspects, if we're being honest here. Google cars might be cool and might be ""the best thing possibly"" to other people, who are most likely lazy, but I stick with my opinion and hopefully, others will too. So, once again, I say that Google cars are not a good idea and should not be promoted. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A7EAE7AFF887,"My position on driverless cars is that I am against it. Autonomous cars still need the driver to be focused on the road. The driver must always be ready to take control of the car in any situation. I feel like autonomous cars give a false sense of safety when it comes to driving one of these autonomous cars. The cars arent fully autonomous they still require the driver to have his hands on the wheel in case he has to overtake the controls.

One reason I am against it is because no road that we drive on is fully predictable, so the cars wont know what to do when some situations arise. Most people who buy autonomous cars think they dont have to focus on the road and just leave it all to the car. Thats false, thats what makes these cars dangerous in a sense. "" The can steer, accelerate, and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill,"" this is the reason I am against it. There may be a time that the driver needs to take over and steer the car out of danger, but since the driver had a false sense of security, he/she wont have time to react. They wouldnt have time to react because they might've been doing something else in the driver seat thinking that the car will steer itself. This is why drivers should always be in full control of the car at all times, because no road is predictable and it requires fast human skills if any situation arises.

There might be safety precautions that can try to prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. This wont help at all in my opinion. Since the driver isnt doing anything, they will feel tired and bored and close their eyes and sleep. If they're really tired they wont hear the warning signs about work zones or any other warning in that matter. Everyone is different, some people are light sleepers and others are heavy. ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" This will fail in some occasions. Say you're a heavy sleeper, and you dont feel the vibrations, and you crash into an object. Will that be your fault or the manufactorers fault for giving you a false sense of safety? Does the vibration have a setting to make it vibrate violently to wake the driver up? Does the vibration start happening at different distances depending on the speed of the car? Also how does one know the reaction time of a driver? These are the test they need to do to know how to make these cars safer. The reaction time of a person woken up from sleep is really slow compared to someone who is fully awake. Also how does the car recognize that a danger is going to happen.

In conclusion this is why I think autonomous cars is not good for the people. Its not safe for the driver who is moving at high speeds down the highway with a false sense of safety. Its not safe for pedestrians who cross streets not knowing if a human is controlling the car or not. Streets will never be predictable and the computers on the car will go off of predictability. Yes there will always be a traffic hazard everywhere you go, and the car might not know what to do and its up to you to get yourself and the car out of harms way. This wont happen if you're asleep at the wheel thinking the car will do it itself and you wont have to do a thing. I feel like if a person is wanting to buy a autonomous car, they will have to take courses on how to correctly use the controls and also what to do when theres an emergency ahead. They will have to know the fundimental things like dont fall asleep on the wheel, always be focused and looking for potentional hazards ahead. Always put your hands on the wheel whenever the car tells you to. Also the main thing they should focus on is to never trust the car to get you from one place to another without your assistance along the way. Thats why in think autonomous cars a negative thing.                    ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

61B9CDA20A95,"Now that technology is advancing greatly from the twenty-first century, topics such as driverless cars are now becoming an option. While there may be positive aspects of having driverless cars, in personal preference the negative out-weigh the positive.

For starters in the beginning paragraph the author of this passage is trying to persuade people to imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore. The sentence is in a way contradicting because there most likely will not come a time when no one will buy a car, they will always be around, just more efiicient and improved. Secondly in paragraph two sentence three it states that the car still alerts the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. The point of having driverless cars is so that the ""driver"" does not have to do any work, so by the driver having to be alerted whenever a problem happens is not so efficient as it may seem.

In paragrpah four and five the author seems to talk a lot about how the car will need a lot of this and that; such as needing ""a whole lot of sensors."" By needing all these supplies like video cameras being mounted near the rearview mirror. Right there is an error, if at any given time an accident or something were to happen and the driver needed to take over, how would she or he be able drive and look at the mirror or cars in the way if there is a camera in their way? The author also claims that the most important bit of technology in the system if the spinning sensor, and how it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroudnings, and the combination is necessary for the driverless cars to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. While this may sound ""cool"" the author and creators of driverless cars forgot to mention how much money it would cost to make a driverless car, let alone for one, but over millions of cars? It would just be more efficient to make regular cars as they are made now, and save money.

Some people may argue that using regular cars just wastes gas, and etc, but people have already made cars using electricity rather than oil. Again in paragraph five the author says that ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" Well if people allow cars to drive on their own and have all these sensors and wires that would ""mimic"" the skills of a human driver, won't disfunctions go wrong somewhere along the way? Even today with technology it can't always be trusted, because something can always go wrong, and if you have a family in a driverless car and something were to malfunction... Not a great situation to be apart of. Yes it would take a lot of trying and the end result could be amazing and superficial, but it's not worth it.

In paragraph six when it is stated that no way before 2000 would anyone be able to make something intersting, and devices such as sensors, computers, and maping weren't there. That is completely agreeable with, but is making driverless cars the most efficient way to use those resources that we do have? Yet again there would be so many malfunctions that would occurr. Paragraph seven it is said that the car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. That's not very helpful or useful for people who need to get places. Many driving signs are over 25 mph. Not very efficient there.

If someone was in a driverless car he or she would not want to have to worry about anything. ""This means the human driver MUST remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" (paragraph 7) The whole point of being in a driverless car is to not have to worry about anything, and staying alert is the last thing someone would want to do. It is as if that person is driving a car, so he or she might as well be driving. One thing that is mentioned which has botha positive and negative outlook on it is how GM developed seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Thar is a positive, yet one option is to have flashing lights on the windshield. Wouldn't having distracting lights on a windshield distract other people who could be potentially driving? That could then cause an accident and more problems.

This article does present the positive and negative views. Paragraph eight specifically states ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" The point that has been trying to be made across the entire time. Safety is a big concern, which is agreed, but having displays that signal when the driver needs to drive is not that great.

The idea of having driverless cars is magnificent and might come true as time and technology advances even more, but it is believed that it is too soon to have driverless cars.    ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
3E5E0038C60A,"Driverless cars are coming. Driverless cars would not be a great addition to today's modern technology. Today's technology is still progressing and is not yet ready to support a driverless car. Some may believe that driverless cars would be an amazing addition to our modern world, but those who do are wrong.

Driverless cars encourage the bad habit of lazyiness, that too many people already frequently engage in today. With the possiblity of driverless cars, that can do 90 percent of driving, people now have to do less than what they already have to do. Driving has already made life easier for people, it is unnessary to do away with the little work people have to do. Driverless cars will only encourage more projects that will attempt to minimize the work preformed by humans. Thus, creating this attitude of lazyiness and not wanting to have to ever do anything that requires that slightest amount of energy.

The text states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This quote from the text is a prime example of even if technology is ready for driverless cars are people themselves ready for the responsbility that comes with driverless cars. Today, too many people already do not take responsiblity for their actions, so what is to happen if the technology fails and a car wrecks and kills the opposing driver? Should that person be tried for manslughter or should they get to get away with killing an innocent person? People today try to blame that wrong doings on anything or anybody, they are in no position to take on the responsiblity for any accidents involving diverless cars.

Those who believe that driverless cars are a good thing for us would argue, ""Now the driving experience can be alot less boring and more enterianing."" Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, says ""The psychological aspects of automation are reallly a challenge. We have to interpret the driving run in a new way."" Some manufactures want to successfully bring in-car entertainment to driverless cars to prevent people from getting bored. Driving, wether it be in a driverless car or not, should not be a ""fun and exciting experience"". Do people realize that they are in a machine that holds the capability of taking the lives of many? That should not be something fun for you, you should take it with a great deal of seriousness. Scientist, that study the brain, say texting while driving turns off one of the parts of the brain that is used for focusing while driving. What do people think all of the in-car entertainment will affect your brain when it becomes that 10 percent of the time that you must take control and drive?

Some would also argue that technology is up to par and is able to handle driverless cars. The text states, ""Automakers are contining their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Technology is clearly not ready if automakers are just hoping that problems ahead will be solved. This mindset will get people killed once they decide to release the car to the public.

Driverless car would not be a great addition to our modern day technology. Our already developed technology cannot support it. Automakers are hoping that problems will be solved. People are not mentally ready to take on the responsibility that comes with driverless cars. Driving should not be entertaing and the entertainment could affect our brains and the ability to focus when its the person turn to control the car.

072D54558C64,"My agrument for this passage is that although theses cars seem to be really nice and might help save people from accidients and save money they may not be the best option. Driving is a very serious thing and in this agrument I'm going to tell why i think that they shouldn't be made. Driving can always need improvement why not keep the cars we have and help them out and keep people driving what they own. Plus money is a very important aspect in this agrument, having a driveless car can cost lots of money.

People who drive can say that they don't like driving all the time but most can say that they enjoy getting to drive if we have cars that are driveless that takes away the fun that people have. If we make these driveless cars that means that the newer generations with not know how to drive cars. People will not want ot get put as much if we have driveless cars. I don't think that people have the money to spend on these cars to drive them so we may have lots of people walking if we were to switch to these cars.

If driveless cars are made they is a very big possibility that people will not want to pay attention to the roads and that will cause more accidents than what there already is. Even though the drive is suppose to watch the road when in the car still doesn't mean that people wont think that the car can do it all on its own. They will not watch the road as much as what they do now and it can cause wrecks that are not needed.

Having drivers have a driveless car is not a good idea because they willl think it is okay to play on their phones and mess around in the car. The car may have antilock brakes but that does not mean that the car is completely save for being accident free. If we have teenagers that are driving in these cars they might think that it is expectable to play around even more than what they do now. Maybe adding things to cra sthat we have now and giving them some newer safety assets might be the solution to our problem. That might be a soultion to our probelm of accidents and it will still allow people to drive.

Another thing to think about is the laws that will have to change for these people to make these cars. Like speed limits and how the car will cars handle traffic in large cities. We alos have to think about if they are really a energy saver car or if it is just as bad as the cars we are using.

In conclusion, I think that this car shouldn't be developed for the reasons of safety. This car may have some very nice aditions to it but we still have to think about whats best for the drivers. The cars that we drive now can use some new technogly but having a driverless care kind of seems a little to extreme. People love driving so why not keep the cars we have today and just keep inproving to make them better for us.

But i feel like before anyone makes thier minds up about whether we should or shouldn't uses these cars that are driverless there needs to be more research done and tests to see how these cars work. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

The very fact that these vehicles could drive by themselves, even under specific conditions, should be our inspiration to keep moving forward with the idea. Technolohy we have now is way more advanced than the technology we had in 2009. This means that not only will be progressing the idea of driverless cars be faster, but more efficient due to better working conditons. If this development were to stop now, I know America would regret it.

Although the driverless cars are said to not be completely able to function on their own 100% of the time, they are able to tell the driver when they are not able to do so. With sensors and vibrations the vehicles have to warn the driver to be ready to take over the wheel the driverless car takes many precautions to ensure that there be no accidents. Drivers of these vehicles are forewarned that they must be ready to take control of their trasportation at all times. Doing this defeats the mentallity that the drivers should be sleep or doing other activities and not be responsible of their car. This funtion of the smartcars, along with its ability to brake and warn drivers on its own, strongly benefits the safety of all drivers.

Oil is equal to wealth. The world uses it for everyday uses such as driving or cooking or activities that require electricity. The article states that using the smartcars will reduce the usage of fuel, which is a huge issue for the world today. There are lives being lost over the functions of oil, countries and other territories become enemies because of selfishness formed from the want of oil, and once it is all gone, its gone. Scientists spend years trying to find the solution to oil inventory, why not use every way we can conjure to do so.

Smartcars are giving the world potential. They are giving the world potential to progress on to new technologies. They are giving the world potential to become a safer place for not only drivers but all inhabitants. They are giving the world potential to help our Earth. Development of driverless cars could very well save our world from plummeting back to all the inferior positions humans have overcome.           ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6320FA8D8D17,"There is so much technology in the world we live in today. Our society revolves around technology and depends on it to survive. Without cars how would we be able to travel places or simply go grocery shopping. It would be potentially impossible to do the simplest of things. Transportation is key to the society we live in. Cars are very fundamental, but are driverless cars really that necessary. It might be very fascinating to drive but are they all that safe?

Driverless Cars still require the driver to do some of the driving if the circumstance requires them to. Such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" Meanwhile the drivers are waiting they could easily fall asleep or get distracted and not pay attention to their surroundings. They would rely on the car so much that if it came to their turn to drive, they would not be prepared to take over the wheel.

""Lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" Because of the development of the driverless cars; the driver will not be in control at all times, only sometimes. The car will be doing most of the driving. The drivers only job will have to be to stay alert and watch out for his/her surroundings. This is likely to cause more accidents because the driver may not be paying attention to the road at all times. Since he/she is not the one driving.

""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is where the arguments will began. If someone driving a driverless car gets into an accident who will be the one that is really to blame? If this type of technology gets approved they will also have to make new driving laws towards driverless cars.

""We grow closer to the destination everyday."" Even though driverless cars are the future for our society. It is also important to remember the importance of safety. We must care for one another and not let new technology overwhelm us. Ourselves, as the priority, must come first. The safety of everyone is at stake with this new development of driverless cars.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
8A3D47F5E900,"There are many positive and negative outcomes that could come from the driverless cars. I believe driverless cars shouldn't be created for public use because they'd be a waste of money and energy. They'd be a waste of money because they aren't really needed to help society progress. They would also be a waste of energy because people are wasting time trying to prefect them when we don't really need them. Driverless cars would also take alot of resouces,like metals and cables, that could be used on more important things that we could actually benefit from. Some car manufacturers could cause more harm to people rather than helping them because they're not fully prefecting the cars and it causes more damage than neccessary. I also believe we shouldn't have driverless cars because people will spend too much time on these cars and changing the driving laws that even if they may think the car will know what to do at every moment if an accident occurs they still won't know who to hold responsible if someone is injured.

If the cars were released to the public then the time it'd take to change the laws would give time for the cars to malfunction even more. They'd also waste time and money trying to make the roads compatable with the cars by using electric wiring instead of the basic roads we use now. Finally I think we shouldn't have these cars because even if they do perfect them then safety will only be provided 90 precent of the time making the chances of an accident higher and they would cause more navagational problems.

CE47D3F9ED5E,"In todays world things have evolved so much that now we even have driverless cars. In my opinion, I am not in favor of driverless cars. There are many issues that come about when talking about driverless cars. Some issues would include, the age of legal drivers, the liability, and whether or not the drivers has to pay attention or not. All of these issues can be explained throughout this paper.

Today the age that a driver gets their license is 16 years old. With driverless cars, the legal age of drivers would probably be lowered. This could even be lowered to the age of young children. I believe it is an awesome opportunity to be able to drive. Since the car is driverless, would drivers still need to go through traning like there is now? If there wasn't any training and the car would malfunction and the driver had to take control, then the driver behind the wheel would not know what to do. The article says, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigting through roadwork or accidents."" Even if cars become totally driverless, will they actually know right away when an accident has occured in front of them?

Another issue that could come up with driverless cars is, the liability. Who's fault is it? Today there are laws that decide who is at fault in a car accident. If the cars were totally driverless then there would be no need to focus on the road and the driver could be doing whatever they wanted. What would happen if there was a constuction zone ahead and the driverless car didn't know and kept driving and hit someone or something, would the accident be the drivers fault or the manufacturers? "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the naufacturer?"" I'm sure there are many manufacturers who would not like all of the liability to fall back on them. That could end up costing them more money than what they are getting from the driverless cars. If it is the drivers fault then they could just say that they were told they didn't need to pay attention and they could sue the manufacturer.

The last issue that comes to mind is, does the driver need to pay attention if the car is totally driverless? I think that the real attention getter with driverless cars is that the driver wouldn't have to watch the road and could be doing stuff with the passengers in the back seat. The only problem with this is, is the car fully able to correctly drive itself through traffic and dangerous situations or does someone need to pay attention the whole time? If they could fully promise drivers that the car is capable of driving through any situation then it would be okay.

I do think that eventually cars will be driverless, but I think that manufacturers and law enforcers need to take a little bit more time developing ways that these problems can be fixed. ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" They need to stop and think about how they can fix the problems such as, they age of legal drivers, the liability, and whether or not a driver needs to pay attention at all times. Once this is all cleared up then I will fully be for driverless cars.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BC70FBD772FA,"I think that driverless cars would be a bad idea. I say this because people got their license for a reason, so they could drive. It says in the text that it would alert the driver when to take control, what if the person sitting in the drivers seat wasn't paying attention and the car wrecked? Then what would happen? My third reason is it would cost a lot of money to make all of the driverless cars, what if people didn't like them? Then manufacturers wasted all their money and time building them.

I think driverless cars is a bad idea. A lot of people went and got their license so THEY could drive, not to have some car drive. I think people would much rather drive their car themselves because if someone else driving wasn't paying attention they could crash cars in the driverless car. Anything could happen since there isnt anyone to pay attention in the driverless car.

The driverless car idea is bad for another reason because in the text it says the car will alert someone if they need to take control. What if someone doesn't respond to the alert right away? Then they could crash into a person or thing. People would have to pay attention at all times and that just gives me another reason to stick to cars with drivers. When you drive a normal car you have to pay attention all the time so I would just stick with that car.

My last reason on why driverless cars are a bad idea is that what if a lot of people ended up not liking them? Then the manufacturers would have just wasted all of their time and money on the cars. The manufacturers should have a test car before making a bunch, to see how people feel about them.

I think driverless cars are a bad idea because people got their license for a reason, people wouldn't be paying attention at all times, and people could end up not even liking them.       ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B87D3E1BB6A8,"I am against the idea of the driveless cars. What would be the point of getting a license if your not the one driving the car. It takes the fun out of driving. I am also against the idea because it will make people want to look at their cell phone knowing that the car is driving and not them and it will create a habbit when it is their turn to drive the car.

What happens if someone got into a wreck and died? This could change the world as we know it. After these driveless car will be flying cars then everyones own personal rockets and so on. This will also make people lazy by having a car drive itself. What would be the point of even having a car. I understand that it would be fasinating to just be able to sit and look around at stuff on the way to your destination or even just relax. Why not just stop and explore? Why not just have gas stations fill up your gas for you, or even robots do your own homework or chores?

I conclusion, I think that creating driveless cars is not a very good idea because it will just make people lazy. It will make them more distracted than being more foccused on the road. They will text more and call more when driving on the road.                        ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
49C7A017F822,"Driverless Cars are Coming is a story about cars that don't really require a human driver. It talks about the history of driverless cars and how far they have come. It also gives some examples of some driverless cars. However, in the story it describes how these driverless cars have some positive and negative aspects. I believe that these cars have positive aspects and should be developed more because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel, the drivers will be more alert, and they have a lot of safety functions.

To begin with, I am for the development for the driverless cars because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel. For example, in the story it says, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial notion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.""

In addition, the next reason I am for the development of driverless car is because the drivers will be more alert. For example, in the story it says, ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" The story also says, "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" Finally, one last example from the story is when it says, ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.""

Finally, the last reason I am for the development of driverless cars is because they have a lot of safety functions. For example, in the story it says, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over---something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" Also, another example the story says is, "" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.""

In conclusion, I am for the development of driverless cars because they are able to mimic the same skill of a human at the wheel, the drivers will be more alert, and they have a lot of safety functions.                        ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
C7C132E63218,"I think that driverless cars could be a great thing to have in the future, if they're safe enough to carry out the same actions that a driver can. In the future though, if kids grow up around driverless cars and aren't actually taught the rules of the road, then if there is an emergency that requires the drivers immediate attention as stated in the article, then the driver probably wouldn't know what to do. This can cause injury or even death to the people driving around him/her.

I also think that driverless cars could be a great thing for the future of technology, but the question that is asked in paragraph 9 of the article is very important to keep in the minds of the car manufacturers. If people rely on their car to do the driving for them, then if there is a wreck who is a fault, the driver or the manufacturer? If you do get blamed instead of the manufacturer, then I don't think that it is really fair because you weren't doing the driving and you trusted the driverless car to get you to your destination safely, and it didn't do that.

Considering these things though, if they were to teach the kids or even adult that didn't grow up around these cars the rules of the road and how the car works to prevent accidents like this from happening then i'd be all for driverless cars. They would be super cool in my opinion and if they worked correctly without many reported accidents, then i'd definitely try to get one.

937CDD403137,"Driveless cars can be very dangerous. The reasoning to make these cars is kind of crazy to think about, waking up in the morning knowing that you don't have to drive all the way to work. Sounds pretty good right? But there are some downsides that come in to affect when concerding getting one such as the accidents they could cause, the money it takes to make, fix and to buy, and the history of drivless cars such as what companies that made them so far and if they have been sucsesfull or not.

One of the main reasons that driveless cares shouldn't be made anymore is the risk of accidents. That is where the technology kicks into play like passage 4 states ""Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars, but how much smarter did the cars need to be?"" This is th first question that comes to mind when thinking about these cars. Is there a way that these cars become to smart on thier own which causes accidents to occour such as the car taking over the sterring from the driver or when it is driving its self is it going to know when to brake or not.

The biggest reason why drivless cars should not be made is the money. This car could not be afforable in our world today with all the upgrades and new technology. Plus it would be way more money to get a ""smart car"" fixed then it would be to buy one, but the big factor of the money issue would be making them and how much it would be to put all that technology and software in to the cars and all the body work and sensors it would just be way to much money for the ordinarary man to afford.

Last but one of the key factors into why this ""driveless"" car should not be made anymore is the history of these vichles. Passage 3 states it best ""Many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" This is why when manufacturers of Google who made the first smart car said that it would be nearly impossible to make anymore smart cars unless there is something done to the roads.

All of these reasons are just a few of why the production of these driveless smart cars should stop. They would not help us in the world as much as they think they would.                  ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4934E8AB3F32,"Driverless cars have been in all of our minds since television and moives have put them there. Google has had driverless cars since 2009, but are they safe to be in one. While haveing a driverless car seems epic it does have some downfall to it. Driverlesss cars , or smart cars, are a bad idea because it cost a large amount of money, a driver must be on the wheel and on alert at all times, and it even has problems with the law.

Driverless cars in the late 1950s had to run on a special track. The smart-road systems worked well. It was actully a succesful test, but it would have require massive upgrades to the existing roads. The roads would be too expensive to upgrade. So instead of smart-roads they moved on to smart cars. The smart cars would need a lot of sensors to work. The senors would of course become more advance, but so well the cost.

Although the smart cars cost a large amount it also still needs a driver at the wheel. The car can handle speeds up to 25mph, but the sensors make sure the dirver hold on to the wheel. Even though it is a smart car none of the cars can go without a driver at the wheel. The car would need a driver for roads it can't navigat thourgh. Such as work zones and around accidents. The car can not navigat thourgh these places which is why it alerts the driver that the need to take control of the wheel. To improve this the manufacturers put cameras in the smart car to watch driver. They make sure that the driver is focused on the road. If there is a road the car needs help with, it would vibrate the seat to alert the driver.

Even if the car can alert the driver the law focus on on how focused the driver is. In some states it is illegal to test a computer-driven car. Such states worry the the car would cause an accident to the passengers, and pedestrians. If the traffic laws change it would still need to cover liability of the accident. So if the car fails and caused an accident would the driver or manufacturer be at fault.

So in the end driverless cars are a horribly idea. They would cost a large amount of money. As well as they are not actully driverless and needs someone to be there, and they are agist the law at some states. Driverless cars should just stay in television and moives.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9E502030CA7E,"Sure, driverless cars sound interesting, but are they worth the risk? With the recent dovelopment of driverless cars, the technology for them is only advancing. It might be fun, it might be cool, but is it's not safe. Not only would driverless cars be dangerous themselves, but theres also other issues, such as; economy dropping, the inability to drive those cars specifically, and several legal issues to think about. The future is now, where cars are assential to everyday life, for some, cars are their life.

Many people make their living off selling cars, advertising cars, building cars, designing cars, and even workers for car companies like Subaru, Toyota, Ford, Chevy, and more. On the radio, drivers hear tons of car sales and ads. If all the companies, all the advertisements, all the sales, all the new disigns, and every last car builder were to have to cope with driverless cars, many citizens would be out of a job. The job market for cars would collapse and so would the economy leaving thousands unemployed. Also, gas and oil would no longer have anywhere near as much value as it does now. Without oil and gas prices, even more poeple would be without jobs. Not to mention taxes would be brought up on everything else to try and keep the economy stable, but in reality, the rise in taxes would make everyone but the government looking for loose change. Especially people who have more importants things to pay for, like children and disability.

The inability to operate the cars would be even more an issue for people wiht disabilities. Blind and deaf people can now at least get cars that can be modified to adjust to their ability, but as these driveless cars are just being made, it would take them even longer to modify them for the disabled to use. Even without a disability, the cars would be like taxis, so what about people with social anxiety? The driveless taxi causes them to leave their home and fetch one for themselves. Social anxiety is an illness and affects most people one way or another. Social anxiety can prevent someone from doing the simplest of things. Things that even a mere child could do. That's another problem with the cars, what if children run away in them? They have the ability to, but at this point, there's no law against it.

Along with the dovelopment of new cars, there would be NEED to be new laws to go with them. If people think it's okay to drink and drive now, there will be even more of an issue if that person's not the one driving. If they're drunk, they could even fall asleep amd end up all the way across the country because they never told the car when to stop driving. Even when the operator of the car isn't drunk that could happen. Since there's no laws against it, they could just fall asleep while driving and cause accidents. If they think its okey to sleep, they will cirtainly think that texting, getting on social media, and watching videos is okay. They'll stop paying attention to the road, and could get seriously hurt. Getting hurt won't be the only bad thing to happen.

Economy build up, people out of jobs, kids taking cars, disability mobility, legal documents, could all be avioded if the risk wasnt taken to make these driveless cars. They might be ffacinating and new now, but will it be worth it when the economy falls apart, when you lose your child, or get badly injured?

505862FA47F6,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article that is written by someone who has perspectives on what is good about driverless cars, and what is bad about the cars. After reading this article I believe that the driverless cars are going to be very helpful, and useful to people in the future. I believe that driverless cars will be helpful because the driver will not have to do much work, because the car drives itself 90% of the time. Also in this article the author tell us that the Google driverless cars, can drive up to half a million miles before the car crashes. Driverless cars will also be helpful because the people that were originally driving, do not have to memorize directions anymore.

Being a driver requires a lot of attention to the road, and it is hard to pay attention to everything else that is going on around them. With the new driverless car, you do not have to drive the car 90% of the time, which allows for more time to think about other things or make sure that your kids are behaving in the back seats, without having to pay attention to the road. Although 10% of the time you may have to drive, the other 90% you are worry free of driving and can focus on other things that you need to.

When people are driving themselves, they tend to be in car accidents very often whether it is severe or not. With the driverless car, you can prevent accidents from happening for a much longer time. Driverless cars have gone up to half a million miles before ever being in a single accident. Going half a million miles without an accident, or the car breaking down is unheard of and nearly impossible, but with the driverless cars, the technology is so outstanding, that the car can go this far.

Using a GPS while in a car can be distracting and not safe to the driver, and everyone else that is in the car. Since the driverless car drives for people, now the people in the car can set the GPS and not be distracted by the road. With this feature, the car will always know when the right time to turn is, and will always get you to your destination on time. If you are a person who is late a lot or gets lost all the time, then you might be interested in this car, because it does all of the work for you.

Driverless cars are a great idea because they drive 90% of the time, which leaves the driver to be focused on other things, it can drive up to half a million miles before crashing or breaking down, which will make the car owner feel very safe and secure in the car that they own, and also the car takes you where you tell it to because of the GPS system, which can make the owner worry free about getting lost.

Even though the price of the car,and the road work that needs to be adjusted will be expensive but will be totally worth it.

First of all, i agree with the making of the car. It is a great invention for the future. It has good perks of course such as, not driving, being quite safe, being able to text without driving,and it also would reduce the fuel of a normal taxi cab to about one half.

Secondly the cars have"" position-estimating senors, GPS receivers, radar sensors, motion sensors, 3-D model of the cars surroundings.""

The good thing is that the smart car would be able to take you anywhere you desire. I think it would be a great idea if your a begining learner and dont have that much expiernce and or if you are under the influence of alcohol. It is a good car for thoes who like to text while they drive you will finally be able to text without killing yourself or getting pulled over by the police. You will be able to return home or to your destination safely. It uses less fuel which is great we wont use all of it and have to raise prices on fuel if we use less.

In my mind that is one huge advantage to the driverless cars because it would help with less accidents and be safer for everyone around. Even though they are not completely driverless that is still very impressive, I mean the only time they driven would be in and out of driveways for the car to get started. The car stops at stop signs and lights by itself and has had no crashes, that is unbelievable!

With all the people driving and all the cell phones around you can imagine that people still text and drive even though it is illegal right? If you have a driverless car people will stop texting and driving and start texting and ridiing. With the driverless cars those people who think they need o get a text off every minute will actually be able to without crashing into you! Although there are parts where they will eventually have to drive that is a lot less time for them to text and drive than it is when they text and rvie the entire time. Even with out texting and driving that is a ton less crashes and ton of more people saved each year.

Even if you are not still into the driverless car experience yet, just wait there is more! If you are one of those people who ask; Can you still drive? Obviously you still can! The car will have back out of driveways and onto roadway construction and through accidents. So there is no need to worry about it ddriving through bad areas or location becuase you have to! Plus when it driving and it getting ready to do something bad it sends a vibration into your seat to let you know that you have to take over the wheel and start driving.

With all of the facts listed how can you not be with the flow of driveless cars? Well really they are not completely driverless but pretty much close. With all the less accidents how can someone not want a driverless car? Even the pedestrians will be safer without all the drunk and texting drivers around town. To be even safer if you do not trust it you can still take over the wheel in certain situations. Most importantly you have more time to do the things you want like maybe knit while driving or catch up on a book. You can do many things with a safe driverless car!",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
184077A08F67,"Technology has become almost fully integrated into today's society. Computers, smart phones, and more are used in a positive aspect; the driverless car is no exception. The development of driverless cars is a positive and necessary one, one that will help improve society significantly.

One of the most important features of driving is safety, and the driverless car has been safe. Google's cars that can drive independently under specific conditions have ""driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" The driverless car has not been fully developed, yet already Google's cars have successfully driven over a long distance without any accidents. Technology is constantly improving, and so will safety. Google's cars have position-estimating sensors, automative radar sensors, and even a rotation sensor on the roof. As these senors are improving, it is also making ""driving safer and also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" Once the driverless car is completed, it should have the sensors and technology to keep drivers safe, more than the ability of an actual human drivers to keep themselves safe. The advanced technology is not only a dream, but is slowly becoming a reality. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, ""believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream."" The driverless car is a ensured success, and with the development of the driverless car, comes the ensured safety of the driver.

Not only would the driverless car be safe, but it would also be efficient. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a future with these efficient cars. Brin says that the cars, ""would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" The driverless car can be made into an efficient car, saving fuel and allowing for more flexibility than other mediums of public transportation. The cars would be able to take one anywhere while having a better environmental impact. The development of these driverless cars would ""fundamentally change the world"" for the better.

Lastly, the driverless car would be able to provide safety as well as entertainment. Currently, cell phones and almost everything is a distraction and hazard to the human driver. But with the driverless car, the driver is able to maintain his own safety and entertain himself. Some manufactures are going to bring ""in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the drivers need to take over."" The driver can now safely entertan himself and know he will be safe. The technology is able to instantly alert the driver, keeping him from coming into harm's way. The driver has luxury, comfort, and safety with the development of the driverless car, something not available to the current driver.

The driverless car has too many positives, and should most certainly be developed. The development of the car would bring about greater safety, efficiency, and entertainment to every driver. The potential of technology is limitless, and the driverless car should be used to further enhance and accomodate the experience of every driver around the globe.

8464857F4FFE,"I feel that we should not have driverless cars. They could malfunction while someone is riding and cause an accident. There are also a lot of flaws to them. I also feel that most people wouldn't be able to afford them and then companies are wasting money. Why would a company make something that won't sell very well?

As I said, they could malfunction while someone is driving. A wire could be loose or the sensors could stop at any time. The car may not even be able to tell you that there are issues if there is a problem on the main circuit. What would happen if I hit somebody because my sensors stopped working? In the article it said that they are not sure if the blame is on the driver or the company. To me that's unfair, I wouldn't purposely hit somebody. There are too many flaws to this idea and even more could occur down the road. It's too unsafe and multiple disasters are more than likely to occur.

These cars would also cost a lot of money. In today's economy, a lot of people are struggling to even get jobs. They wouldn't waste money on something they don't need. They have a car that they can drive themselves, that's more safe. People would also have to pay for gas and probably have to get it checked out for multiple reasons. How much would all of it cost?

Overall I feel it could be helpful in some ways but would you really trust a driverless vehicle? You wouldn't just send your kids in a car with no driver. It doesn't seem very safe and I feel that there are too many flaws. I wouldn't continue developing them for cost reasons and safety issues. Once you fix one flaw, you are more than likely to just find another. This is why I feel we should quit developing driverless cars.              ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
DE919A3F2D63,"Driverless cars are not a good idea. They are just another way to end up having more fatalities each year. People can barely drive cars now, so how is it that having a robot drive them will make our lives any better? We already have taxis, which gives people jobs. If we invested in driverless cars, that would just rid people of their jobs. Here are a few other reasons why driverless cars are not a good idea.

First off, the cars are not even truly driverless. In paragraph 2, it says that Google has cars that alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. What if the passenger fell asleep, trusting that the car would do its job? There are many things that could go wrong in a situation like that. I would not trust that it would end well.

Second, they might put cameras in the car, stated in paragraph 7. I do not know about anyone else, but I would not want someone watching me the whole time I was driving. That is an invasion of privacy and should be illegal.

Finally, the technology could clearly fail, which is said in paragraph 9. Innocent passengers who are riding in the vehicle could be mistakenly blamed for an accident and would wrongly be responsible for something they did not do.

In conclusion, driverless cars are just a bad idea. They would put people out of a job, and they are not fully self-driven. They will invade your privacy and could cost you a lot of money if you are blamed for an accident. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

This would have a postiive affect because the cars would half of the fuel of todays taxi and would more flexible than a bus. Driverless cars are coming soon and has been used before, these will soon be able to help us and change the world, they will soon change the way we look at cars today.

Google cars have been known to drive more than half a million miles without a crash . This showes that they are safe but arent completly driveless. The use of driverless cars beneifits use because they arent driverless in certain conditions. These are arent driverless and require the use of the driver conditions like pulling in and out of driveways, getting through complicted traffic issue, and getting through road work. This will have a negative affect because they should be able to work under all condition of driving. Driverless cars can have negative aspect and positve aspect on the driving laws . In a negative way these cars cant function in certain areas and this can disrupt driving , it is also illgeal to even test computer driven cars in most states, and in a postive way these are allowed to be tested in most states and upgraded to the point of the driver can receive alters to notify them on things.

In 2016 Telsa has projected the use of a computer driven car, with 90 percent of autopilet driving system an used most of the time. otyher cars like Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have pakned to relase the version of a computer driven car in 2020.

2629ECCFFE67,"Are driverless cars a good idea? Driverless cars are a terrible idea because of how dangerous they will be. It is like a robot, anything could happen to the car at any time and then you are stuck, unsure of what to do. This could cause lots of accidents, just knowing that a human will not be operationg the car. In case of an accident, whom is to be blamed, the machine or the ""operator"". These cars should not only be illegalized in the United States, but they should be illegalized everywhere.

Just to say, perhaps something goes wrong with your machine, breaks go out, steering control column gets thrown off, or a control sensor is broke while driving. How will the car know to pull off the road or even know where ""off the road"" is? The cars will not know, what to do they are desgned to just drive and the manufaturers are not thinking about, what if something goes wrong with these cars? They are just in it for the money, they are trying to beat all of the other companies. As the passage states, ""When these vehicles break down , no one will be there to repair them!"" These cars are pretty much just for big money skams, they will come out and be big for a while, then later on everyone will find out they are horible.

What happens when these sorts of cars are in an accident, who will be to blame? There will be accidents with these cars, but when they are in accidents, who will be to blame the car or the operator? No one knwos how this would really play out in court because stuff could break on the car and the car just lost control. If this would be the case you couldn't blame the operator, but you also could not blame a car in court. This would mean that the operator may have injuries, but the biggest thing is that he may not have a car anymore either. Such as the author states, ""How will anyone be put to blame in case of accidents or break downs, but most importantly, if the car is at fault how would the other operator get his or her car fixed?"" This is the biggest thing of all, is who is to blame in these cases?

Sure these cars will be pretty nice and all, but is a driverless car worth the risk of hurting either you or your family? No it is not, that's why these cars should not be legal in the U.S. or anywhere else. As the author states, ""This matter should not only be talked amongst the United States, but also everywhere else in the world to."" The author is very right about this because these cars are very dangerous and should not be aloud to be driven.

In conclusion, these driverless cars should not be legal anywhere in the world. They are dangerous and not safe for anyone. A lot could go wrong with these vehicles and could possibly injure someone. Can things not just be kept simple ,and have people quit being lazy and drive thereselves everywhere rather than having a robot do it.

Their are so many cars with people driving that get in accidents due to impairment and i believe that this technology can really benefit our society.

Their are many things that a car with no driver can lead people to think. Like it may lead people to think that maybe sitting in a car and not driving may get boring. Although if they are a passenger in a car are they bored?

As Dr. Werner Huber added ""We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way."" In addition to that some maufactures are bringing in-car entertainmet and to me that sounds pretty cool. In contrast to that people may think that this might become a safety hazard. The maunfactures think this can be safer do to the progress in the heads up display system which some cars may have and this can allow people to send a text message and keep their eyes on the road watching for when they may need to take over in driving. Finally this leads me to question why the goverment in some states are blocking this technology? To that i can answer with maybe the fear of change. They shouldnt be afraid of that though cause the world is constantly changing and most times change is healthy.

Driverless cars are the future.

People are attracted to the idea of getting in a car and having it take you somewhere without ever touching the wheel.

The cars pose many possitves for our society today.

For example, driverless cars use almost half the gas that the average car uses today.

This can solve many world problems like global warming and keep the demand for gas low which will keep the gas prices low.

Another possitive is saftey.

If computer drove every car people would be much safer than they are today.

Computers are smater and more consitante than humans.

This is why computers and robots have taken many peoples jobs, because they do it better.

If the computers are well made then they will never make mistakes, therefore decreasing the ammout of crashes.

BMW has made the car safer by providing in car entertainment on a heads up display that doesnt work if the driver is texting or on there cell phone, once again making the car safer.

However for some people the concept of driverless cars is scary.

For driverless cars to become a part of peoples everyday lives than many things will have to change.

First many states will have to allow people and companies to test thier cars in their states.

The cars will never be made if they cant be tested and profected in different states.

Also there are mant question with the laws behind whos fault it is if a driverless cars technology fails and someone is injured, the driver or the manufacturer?

These questions will be answered with time and once every car is a self driving car then that question will be irellivent.

They have sensors that sense when a stop light has changed colors. They also can steer themselves and hold accelerateion. Also the self driverless cars are good because alot of people are texting, eating, and putting make-up on while driving and this would decrease accidents having to do with distraction.

Are driverless cars too expensive? Driverless cars would be too expensive to keep developing. Driverless cars would need a lot of technology for the roads and the car, and to create every piece of technology for each car would be expensive.

Will only going 25 mph slow up traffic? Slowing up traffic will interrupt the drivers daily life. The driver will have to begin leaving the house early so they will not get caught in traffic an so, they can make it on time, considering the car will only be going 25 miles mph.

Teenagers no longer getting excited about being able to get their license. Seems like a not so great world to live in.

Driverless cars are supposed to do it all on their own, but they still want driver assistance. When you are the driver in a driverless car wouldnt you get bored? Well if you drive and fall sleep due to the amount of time that you dont do anything. Then sudenly the care will change to the driver mode. you will not know about it because your asleep, so then the car can not handle it and then crash with you in it. This doesnt even have to be you sleeping. It can be texting, listening to music, or grabing something in the car. This is why the driver assistance is very dangerouse to not just you in the car but people that are dirving right next to you.

Your safety is the most important thing so they say. When you are in this vehicle that has tons of wiring, dont you think something is going to go wrong. Well there is, the car could shortcircut in the middle of nowhere. When you find out that the car wont work and you are lost what are you going to do. I garentee you that they didnt think of microchiping your car. Also not even pootinga beaker in it the signals to the closes police station. Both of these two reasons are what if and i know that. But in real life some people tavel really far and they get lost when they travel. This is why safety is the most important things when it come to new technology like this.

The purpose of driving. Driving is the freedom feeling that you get knowing that you are growing up. But what about the younger generation? We worked hard to get our licsence and had to wait a long time. Then the younger generation is tottaly different. When they will go take the driving thest is is only going to see if you know how to turn and park. When the self drive is turned on it is a peice of cake.

C712220F9BD7,"The topic on driverless cares in growing bigger and bigger. Some people like it and some people do not. I like it for certain reasons which include; a possible saftey advantage, healthier for the environment itself, as well as giving drivers breaks when they feel tired but not want to stop to rest or switch drivers. I also do not like the idea of driverless cars because it takes a good time for people who really like to get behind the wheel. It also may serve as a safety hazard if some people choose driverless and some other people choose to drive themselves. Machine and Man do not interact too well at this point of technology even after all the advancements.

I do not know if i like this idea or if i don't. I have mixed emotions. I can not drive yet in my life so this topic may or may not serve to be politically correct. I do like the sound of all the cars that can drive itself. Technology is a huge factor in everyones life right now. It is cool, faster, and does hard work for you. Just imagine the possibilities with cars driving themselves. It would become a big hit to society and sooner or later will not be a question on which is better. It will naturally adaft to our lifestyle. It will indeed help us in making error-less moves on the road to maximize safety. It would also minimize the amount of time to get somewhere. Coming from me as well as many more impacient people, the faster we get there, the better. I would like to take rests without having to stop if the technology gets there. It also serves a great advantage in prtecting the environment with conserving fuel and not giving out those harmful gases like the story explained, and who doesn't like the sound of that? The whole environmental conservation has been up and coming but has been corupted into thinking it isn't our fault as our race, politics have big reason to believe we need to be greener to our planet, and as a matter of fact, the people listen to them. I would on the other hand have to remain always focused incase of an emergency or an accident though, and that is why i do not think it is the best idea in the world.

Like I said in the begining, Man and Machine do not coexist to the best of what is thought. What if there are flaws of these cars and if there are, it could mean so far up to death to people. This whole idea of these cars is based on a what if in my opinion. What if it works without fail? It would in fact be genius, but if it doesn't however, It could be concerning to everyone in our community. I can not drive so i do not know the feeling of getting behind the wheel of a car and driving it around. I do know people who love it, and is kind of their get a way. If this new technology becomes a reality, their passion could become depressed in a way they can not get it back.

To me, this is a what if topic and is taking a huge risk. There would be lots of laws made to protect society made and for what? This is talking about an experiment. It has its advantages along with its disadvantages just like everyother product or new technological design. It is in our natural being to take risks and to be out there. To me, I do not like the idea of the smart car, America in itself can not take on the finances to keep up with reconstruction of road in order for these cars just to run and work.

I was about to get the best gift that could be given to a teenager a gift of freedom,trust,and responsbility I was going to get my lisence. I was so excited to begin driveing I loved it driverless cars would take the joy of driving away. I dont think we should continue to spend a bunch of money devolping driverless cars. There will always be need for human alertness in the vehicle. What happens when there is a crash who is responsble the manufacture or owner of the smart car. With driverless cars there would no longer be any excitment of getting your lisence.

Driverless cars are so expenseive its not practical to own one. On googles driverless car there radar system for one car cost two hundred million dollers. Who realisticly has two hundred million dollers to spend on a prius. With cost like that these cars are mor of a televison fantisy than a practicality. If you were to buy a driver less car you would expect to relax during the car ride.

Actually driveless cars still and will always require human assitance. "" all driverless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"". These driverless cars arnt really driverless the will always require human alertness and asitance while in the vihicle. What will happen if you are in a smart car and there is a crash.

All it would take to breack my computer at home is to spill some grape soda on it. What will happen if the technolgy fails and you hit a pedestrian or anothier car. Who would be responsible for an accident the owner of the car or the manufacturer. ""new laws will be needed in order to cover lialbility in the case of an accident"". "" Driving laws focus on keeping drivers, pasengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that saftey is best achieved with an alert driver"".

The devolpment of driverless cars is a waste of our time and money. Cars will always be somewhat dependent on humans the will never be truly driverless. there will be many liability issuse if an accedent takes place. And what will be the fun in getting your lisence to just sit in a car that drivers itself. I want my children to feel the same way I did when I turned sixteen.

They've come close to building it but fails to be officaly called driverless cars, google has tryed but have only made it to where the car alerts a driver if to close to an object. Theirs been other ways on trying to make a driveless car but come out in fails or to expasive, like the smart-road that has been tested and has had positve records ""but that would mean we would have to change all the roads and make knew ones that would take for ever and the money we would spend on that would leave our economy more in dete then we are"". As the article said.

If driverless cars were to be created in the future how would that impact lifes and country? Well let me tell you more safte laws would have to be made ""like how would be acounted for if some one gets hurt because of a failer in the system, would it be the owner of the car or the companys fault for the failer in their technology"". As the articl said that could cause major problams. With what I just mentioned that brings me to my second question. What if something in the car fails would that impact the intier car and cuase it to break down? As the artical mentions the people trying to creat the driveless car have been testing int with a lot of different technology as said in the artical they've been using sensors, cameras and GPS on the cars, but what if one of the cameras or the sensors would fail to do their job while it's driving on a highway or a main road that would cuase a worse accident then with someone driving it.

In conclusion I would prefer driving so I have more liabilty to know where im going and know that im the one driving. So i ask you would you rather lay your life and family or friends on a a computer or know that you can drive. That is my opion on driveless cars.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
3B5EE97C7C53,"Driverless cars would be very beneficial to our society. It would make an immense impact on our culture and provide simple, fast ways to get around. In the article, many different positives are thoughouly expressed. Because of these specific examples, I believe that driverless cars will be extremely important in America's future and greatly benefit our use of transportation.

The United States, as well as other parts of the world, experience oil and fuel issues. There are frequent shortages of these particular substances, which are extrememly important for our daily lives. In the article, it is said, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" In this quote, from the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" Google cofounder Sergey Brin expresses that these driverless cars will be beneficial to America and the rest of the world. He says that these cars will use less fuel, which unfortunately tends to run short. Driverless cars will benefit the the world's fuel issues.

Another positive to driverless cars are the entertainment and noficiation aspects. Drivers will be able to get different things done while driving. They also will no longer need to worry about distraction factor of driving. Drivers won't have to worry about trying to answer a phone call, respond to a text, or change a song and drive at the same time. The article states, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to driveres trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" In this quote, Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, explains that a driver won't need to worry about answering a text. The driver can answer the text or phone call while the car is not in need of assistance. Fortunately, the car only needs manual assistance in areas of road construction or accidents. This feature of driverless cars will greatly benefit driving today.

However, these driverless cars still do obtain some faults. These faults are included in the article. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" This shows that drivers must retain some sort of awareness of what is going on around them. They cannot take naps or completely zone out, especially when approaching an accident or work zone. Although there are few flaws to the designs of driverless cars, these flaws should be fixed very soon. The article states, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" This quote shows that many of these issues should be resolved in the very near future.

Because of these specific examples in the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I believe that driverless cars will be very beneficial to America and it's many modes of transportation. Driverless cars will use less fuel than our typical cars we use today. They will also require an immensely small amount of attention. Most importantly, any small flaw that these cars possess will be resolved extremely soon. Driverless cars will change our lives for the better.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

They call it ""catching up to the dream."" Technology is starting to do some amazing things, but also doing some not so good things. Everyone always hears their parents or grandparents say "" We didn't have that when I was a kid."" The sad part is, it's true. Technology has come a long way since they were younger. They didn't use to have phones, gameboys, Xbox, or anything kids have now. In 2000 they did not have the technology to make a driverless car, but now in 2016. We do, we have all the technology needed. In fact we have too much technology. It's what our society runs on. Driverless cars will be a big hit, sadly.

It's amazing what people have come up with. Touch screens, cars with built-in wifi, cars that can stop themselves if in danger, and now driverless cars. A driverless car would be amazing if you're too tired to drive, but it could also lead to many accidents. People keep forgetting that technology can fail. If that technology fails, you could be in some serious danger. They say the car will have a way to keep you alert. The only way to be alert is if you're in control. People are getting lazy and this proves it. Everyone around the world have been driving for years upon years. They did not have any problems with it. If we were to tell our grandparents about a driverless car, you better bet they would go crazy and give you the speach about ""when they were young..."" for the hundredth time. I can agree that it's crazy. We should be at the point to let technology control everything. One day it may go to far. By then I hope I'm my grandparents age to give the speach about how it was when I was younger. Technology can be a great thing when it comes to researched. Technology can also be a bad thing because it's taking over and kids now have iPhones at 6 years old. They should be outside with water balloons or playing ball.

Driverless cars aren't a good idea. That's just another thing to show kids how to not be kids. Honestly, let technology stay where its at for a little longer. I'm a teenager and I dread the day technology is all people car about. I know parents that are on their phones more than their kids and their kids would give anything for their parents to ask how their day was or even talk to them. Driverless cars is just another thing that will lead to more and more lazy things. I rather actually have to learn to drive than to have a car drive for me. What's the fun in that? There is none.

93D2F780054B,"For my perspective on the situation, I am not positive nor negitive. Some of the ideas from bouth the positive and negitive side are good as thay are bad. For what I think is what I will pull from the story to my wrighting. As example on the positive side, I think the seat vibrating when ready to back into a car is an amazing idea for drivers who need more help when parking. The negitive side on the outher hand, yes we should not have cars that dirve without human control.

Just because we are fecinated on the idea of cars driveing themselvas does not say we should have than. I will and in from he section it says from television this idea was brought up. If it is from that television is not always right. Especially when it comes to safety. Safety is nouthing to play around with or to toy with. It is a prevention of lot lives and or injeries.

The human driver should have their hands, plure on the weel at all times unless thay have finished there driveing route to their destination. Again for the positive the idea for a camera feed from the rearveiw mirror should be in place for driveing and more so parking help. Anouther and lastly for the positive side, the 3-D model of the car's surroundings. It should be there for better and less reckless driveing. Lastly finishing on this selection of text.

It says thay need human instruction to get around construction or a reck for safer driveing. We need alert drivers at all times. If thay can not handel that thay should not be allowed permition to these machines. People have lives need to be kept. This is what should be done to keep that and less injeries.

In my conclution we should not have self driveing cars. Parts from the car can be used to help us with our own driveing to prevent a reck. In a sertain situation being it a huge rode blocking or little bump into a parked car. pedestrians could be prevented from harm as well. As I have finished my conclution I shall leave you with this.

443139B7E262,"Driverless cars have always been a point of interest as our technology advances. I am for driverless cars because they could make the roads safer.

These driverless cars are not completely driven by a computer. There are certain times where the person in the car has to take over, like work zones or accidents. However, for the most part, these cars have so many sensors and cameras in them that they can drive without the help of a human driver. This could mean that accidents that happen when the driver is distracted or incapacitated, would never happen. Once our technology advances ever furthur and these cars actualy become driverless, then they could prevent accidents.

Cars made by companies like Google or Tesla are not only interested in make a cars driverless, but they want to make a car that would be better for the environment. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a car that ""would use half of the fuel"", and Tesla's focus has been on electric cars. Both of these options reduce or elimate the need for fossil fuels, therefore reducing carbon emmissions and taking better care of our environment.

Although there is some serious work to be done to be able to test these cars to improve the cars to be legally considered safe, I think that the reality of driverless cars is not to far away, and that it is a good thing. They could make the road a safer place and help out our environment.   ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4.28E+11,"Driverless cars can sound like a wonderful idea to most people, knowing they won't have to drive themselves anywhere anymore. They may even think that since it's driverless they can just sit there and play on their phone, not paying attention to anything on the road. Is that really as safe as they say it will be? Yes, you won't have to drive anywhere, but does that mean we should really trust it?

In my opinion, driverless cars sound dangerous. There are many questions asked that haven't been answered, which makes me feel uneasy. The BMW Traffic Jam Assistant sounds like a great idea. If that were in every car you buy now, I dont think we would even need driverless cars. That little modification to a car can make a big difference. I feel as if that would be safer than a self driving car.

In the driverless cars, a system would be powering and driving your car. What if that system malfunctions and/or has a glitch? Would it be the individuals fault or the manfacturers fault? This question has many different answers from different individuals. My answer would be that it would be the cars fault. It's not the individuals fault that the car had a huge malfunction in the system, it's the company's fault. The individual wasn't even driving the car to begin with. Now, if they make it to where the person can still control the car while the system is driving it, that's a different story.

In conclusion, driverless cars can be very dangerous. I feel that people should just drive themselves where they want to go. It's not that hard to drive yourself. the driverless cars that have a malfunction in the system could be a big problem when driving. The Traffic Jam Assistant would be a great idea for regular cars that you drive yourself. It would help with many things drivers never pay attention to now-a-days.

144F804A45C2,"Driverless cars will be helpful for people in the future. There are many pros to a driverless car, if the cars can be made and used then they could help give parents and kide more freedomes. Driverless cars can help with safety on the roads.

Driverless cars could give parents and kids more freedom. They could do this by allowing the parents more free time, because they wouldnt have to find the time out of their schudule to drive their child to a friends house or to a move. The car could pick up the kids and then the kids could text or call their parent to let them know that they have gotten to the place safe. This could also help with being on time, The car would come around the time that it was told so kids would not be able to say they were late because they lost track of time. For the kids, they would have more time to make plans and to hang out with friends. They wouldnt have to wait on a parent to get to their house to pick them up, because their parent is at work. The cars could also help with car pooling if needed they could find the fastest rute to pick up everyone in the group. These are some of the reasons that driverless cars could give parent and kids more freedom.

Driverless cars could also help with safety. For example it would help with drunk driving. The cars are driverless so the intoxenanated person would not be driving, and it would get the person home safely and without putting other people in danger. These cars could also help in dangerous weather, instead of people driving the same speeds in bad weather the car could take them a good speed for the condutions on the road.

Driverless cars give parents and kids more free time and can help keep the roads safe. Kids could do more things with their friends, parents could have somemore time to themselves relaxing at home, there would be a decrease in drunk drivers, and it would help keep people safe in bad weather.

4A131BB88756,"Evolution is an factor of life that effects us all in some way shape or form. As we get new ideas, and put them into pratice we are supporting this factor. With the evoloutinon of cars, going from mauel, to driver less is not only a great, and intuitive idea but also a major part in the evolution of automobiles. I feel as though we should support this advancement for it would prove benifical to a overwhelming number of people. Though I support this idea, I do see the risks, and potential problems that would accompany such a machine. But in my opion the benifits out way the risks.

How many people have died, or have been injured from automobile accidents? The answer generates, a massive amount of concern, and anxiety, though we are the most sophisticated spieces on earth, we also tend to make alot of mistakes. According the the article, self driving cars have gone nearly half a million miles without any major, or minor accidents. That is not only impressive, but also reasuring, well at least to me. Now im not saying that because of this fact the pearson inside the car should go ahead, and take a nap, because machines can't do everything for us.

When i was learning to drive my Grandfather, made told me that when your on a express way the best thing to do is to through it in crusie control, and take a nap. Of coruse this was a joke, when driving the driver must always be alert for possible incursions. I feel the same should be said for self driving cars, for their some road conditons that the car itself cannot handel. The article refers to certain times when the driver should have to take over such as; when construction is taking place, or when navigating around a accident. The driver may not have to drivew always when in one of these cars but when situations such as the ones previously metioned arise,I feel the driver should take the wheel.

To many lives are lost do to driving while under the influence or ""drunk driving"" the alcohal in the drivers system affeects the respons time and, critical thinking skills, wich in turn causes major threats to both the driver, and others around them. Now the question is should someone who is drunk be abel to drive a sekf driving car? My answer is no, because the car may still need the driver to operate the vehical through difficult situations the car itself can't navigate thorugh. I metioned some situations earlier, of when the sober, and normally functioning driver would need to take over but would it be safe to have some one who is drunk to drive through a work zone, or around a accident? So before the driver enters the vechile they should have to be abel to pass a breathalizer test to let the car drive on its own.

Now I know that in my introduction that I said that I was pro self driving cars, but all through out my bodies I talked about how many regulations there should be, but thats only cause I seeboth the benifits, and the dangers. Yes the world should be open to the idea of self driving cars but the world should also note that this isn't a way to completely get out of driving for good, and we also should realize that driving while were impaired is a bad idea wheteher or not the car can drive itself.

2EABB5D7A218,"Driverless cars on coming soon, and most people aren't worried or see the danger of any of this. To have many self driving cars on the street is dangerous and unless the cars have been tested and are fully operational with no common errors or bugs.

Before creating driverless cars, it is very important that they have been vigerously tested and confirmed to be safe. Regulations in most states state that it is illegal to test the computer-driven cars. Safty is a huge factor in deciding weather or not the driverless cars should be everywhere on the street, however they won't be ""everywhere"" for a while. The technology is well known to be expensive, but this can still be at a great risk.

Google's self driving cars are still in development, but recently in the last few months they've gotten into wrecks, and in one case, hit a man on camera, however he is fine now. A situation like that scared a lot of people and changed their mind on these cars. Whether or not the car was still in development doesn't matter, what matters is that these self-driven cars have the ability to do this damage. This isn't even my greatest fear about these cars yet.

Buying a self-driven car has what benifits? Bragging rights? It's a two-hundred thousand early adopter fee, because it's very enforced that you don't fall asleep even if your car is driving for you. The driver still needs to pay attention to the road because at a time that the car doesn't know what to do next, as it goes onto an unmapped road in it's data base, it will alert the driver to take over. In a similar case, the system fails, because computers fail everyday, the driver is not paying attention because his new car can drive by itself, then the system fails as the car is going sixty miles per hour on a road with many other cars. Accidnets can occur if the driver believes that their new car can do everything by itself.

My main issue with these cars is what if someone hacks your car? It sounds silly and far fetched at first, but it has already happened. Some kids in their parent's basement decided to hack a car, just to see if they could, and they sucsessfully did. There was a bug in the software of a particular, non self-driving car, took control of the steering and disaled the breaks. If this can happen to human-driven car, then the odds of this happening to a fully computer operated vehicle will be more copious. If some kids had the ability to do this, imagine all of the car crashes and injuries that could occur if many or most cars on the street were self-driven.

The rise of self-driving cars is a bad idea, it's going to happen, many companies are working hard to be the first, and there is money to be made. There are a lot of problems that rise up with cars that drive themselves, being the drivers themselves not paying attention, the computer shutting down, malfunctioning, or being hacked. There is too much risk in a rise of this caliber.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

These cars can allow us to be safer in most situations, but there are a few where drivers need to be able to take control of the wheel.

Could this invention also help with the enviornment and the costs that people spent on there car or could it make cars more expensive.

Driverless cars can help drivers, passengers, and pedestrians to be more safer than with cars that can only be opperated by a driver.

With the use of cell phones, drivers who use them are more at risk of getting into an accident. Driverless cars can help with this problem. Most people, when they hear about car accidents related to cell phones, think of teen drivers.

This isn't always the case.

Many adults text and drive.

With driverless cars teens and adults can use their phones with out having to worry about getting into an accident.

Although, the driver still has to pay attention to the road it makes it safer.

These cars would create less accidents in these situations or in a medical situation.

If a driver blacks out while driving this could cause a serious accident harming the lifes of themself and others or if the driver has been out drinking at night, these cars provide a safe way of transpertation.

When a car accident occurs, the driver who caused the accident can get into a lot of legal trouble.

With driverless cars the driver won't be the one to blame if someone happen to die in the accident, but the responsibility has to be given to someone.

This means that the company that made the car would be responsible for the accident, which could changer their mind on driverless cars.

The cost of gas can be a major problem.

Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, invisions driverless transportation to use half the fuel we use now.

This would help for the cost in fuel for people who are having a difficult time paying for gas or in could cause the price of gas to go up.

There is one thing we know though.

With these cars using half the gas, our enviornment is becoming a healtheir place.

There will be less polution from the cars in the air, which can benifit our health. Going back to the cost these cars will have you spending, could this car be more expencive then the cars we pay for now.

These cars use rotating sensors, video cameras, automotive radar sensors, GPS receivers, and inertial motion sensors.

All these devices can add to the price of the car cuasing driverless cars to be more expensive.

In the not to distant future we wont have to make dad stay awake the whole drive to Disney world just to make it there on time. We no longer will have to hop in our vehicles when we are moving and have to go back and forth and back and forth from our old home to the new.

Everyone can relate to those long hauls to out of state, whether it be for vacation, visiting relatives, or work. The most memorable part, for myself at least, was wondering where we were going to stop and sleep, or if dad was going to just keep on driving. That will be something of the past in the not so distant future. As of now the cars we have can drive on there own.. Most of the time. There are still some trouble spots such as traffic jams, work zones, and accidents. In the previously stated mishaps the current versions of the cars will promptly alert the driver that there may be an upcoming event in which they will have to intervene.

Gas in the surrounding area currently is sitting around $2.75. From what I know the average car can hold somewhere around 30 gallons of gas. Lets say you fill up your tank and ride until its empty and then fill it up again, and lets also say that it takes you about a week to empty your tank. So on monday you fill it up for around $82.50. Come next weeks monday you need to fill up for another $82.50. In a span of two weeks you have spent $165.00. There are about 4 weeks in a month so that will be $330.00 a month. But you dont just drive your car for a month, so for a year you will be paying roughly $3960 a year! In the new driverless cars they can take that almost $4000 and cut it down to around $2000 since with the technology in the new cars you will be stopping in at a gas station about half as many times as you would be if you were driving in one of the old cars.

The complany Google has sent out a fleet of driverless cars already (with drivers in them ready to take the wheel at any given moment.) to help further the progress towards these great machines. They have driven around half a million miles (500,000 miles!) and are yet to crash.

With this massive combonation of the latest technology we can say goodbye to blindspots for good!

Safety, luxery, money. All three of those are what the new smart driverless cars are offereing. It is almost our duty to open our arms to the advance of this technology.

E479E37B5F9C,"I think that the idea of driverless cars is an awful idea because, ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This ruins the whole point of taking away human error and letting something else drive you. Plus I think that the transition between the car driving and the driver driving would cause more crashes. I could also foresee unprepared drivers to try to use these new ""driverless"" cars. Overall, driverless cars seem to be a waste of time and money to me because they would bore the driver and cause more accidents.

First of all, I think that driverless cars are a waste of time and money because you still need a driver to pay attenton. For me, this would just ruin the whole experience of not having to drive. Even Dr. Werner Huber from BMW agreed that drivers would get bored when he admitted that, ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" This was in response to the question, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive."" Secondly, I think that not having to focus on the road will lead the driver to lose focus so that when they are called upon to drive, they are not ready. The transition from the car drving to the human driving would likely lead to more wrecks because when you are not focusing on driving, you don't really care about focusing on the road. Driverless cars seem to present the same distraction that texting has, and texting while driving is illegal in most states. I also know that some people do not drive because they are not very good at it, and the idea of a ""driverless car"" might tempt them to drive one. These same unprepared drivers would still have to, ""take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues,"" if they were driving a google car which would lead to yet again, more accidents.

Driverless cars are a big hoax. They are not even truly driverless because, "" they still alert the driver to take over."" This would just be boring waiting for your turn to drive. These would also cause more accidents with the rough transition of taking over the wheel especially when unprepared drivers try to use this new technology. I don't think that anyone wants worse drivers on the road, more accidents, more expensive cars, and an even more boring experience with the new and not so impressive driverless cars.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
04B2B51ED063,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" sounds very interesting, but my arugement on this is article is against it because it sounds very unsafe. What if the driverless care malfunctions and you arent paying attention and get involved in the accident? Will the company of the car help you or give you another car or maybe even pay what is costed for the whole situation? Probably not. Its not worth making or even buying one of the driverless cars. Even a car itself malfunctions.

Driverless cars can cost up to millions of dollars or even more. Driverless cars sound like you need to get one and leave the old one. The fact that the driverless car may be really expensive is ridiculess. Only famous people can afford it. Maybe other weathly people can. Not just anyone will be able to afford the car. Any person can afford a car at least that works even if it is an old car. Cars can cost lots of money when you can buy something else.

Many, many people want this car because you dont have to drive but when there is an alert you have to drive. Also it requires a driver anyways. Many people want this car because you can just get one and it will drive by itself so that person can get one his or her phone while the car is in operation itself. This is ridiculess! You dont need a car that will drive by itself so you can enjoy being on your phone. You can go home after whatever event you went to and get on your phone and enjoy it.

This driverless car is not always safe because it can malfunction and cause a really bad accident and it can injure a person big time. The company may or may not help you out in this situation. Why? because the company may think is your fault for not paying attention to the car for being on your phone or doing something else, when the car alert you. The car wont always operate on itself unless its monitored and controlled by someone. Maybe the company is right, but technology malfunctions all the time. It is even worse when malfunction on a car.

This article does sounds like it is a great idea to get a driverless car. Probably anyone may get this car. I disagree for companys to make this types of cars. They should even have a law for making driverless cars that can cause an accident or injure someone. What is the whole point of making a driverless car if it still has to be monitored either way. Doesnt not sound interesting or cool. It is a very dangerous idea. Technology wasnt made perfect and it wont be perfect either.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
8E99D2521C63,"In 2009 Google created ""driverless cars"". They weren't fully independant but they were the beginning of something great. Driverless cars will save the lives of people who would otherwise die in a car crash. Driverless cars will create jobs for people who need jobs. People are getting lazier and lazier, and they don't want to drive themselves anymore. Driverless cars are the future.

Car crashes are caused when a driver isn't paying attention or they are intoxicated. This could mean the driver was texting, eating, changing the radio station, or even falling asleep at the wheel. With driverless cars people will be able to do whatever they want while the car is driving without worrying about crashing. They could text all they want or even sleep. The driver just needs to be prepared to take over the wheel if the driverless car runs into a roadblock and needs to go on a detour or needs to be parked. Driverless cars will take people who are out with freinds anywhere they want to go. Having friends in the car with you is one of the most distracting things to a driver, with all the talking and laughing. Things can go bad really fast. These cars will also help keep intoxicated drivers off the road. Some driverless cars can independantly complete ninety percent of the tasks required. This will get an intoxicated person very close to their home if not all the way there.

Driverless cars will create jobs. Jobs in programing, design, manufacturing, and upkeep of the cars. Some might say that driverless cars will take more jobs than it gives. These people say that taxi drivers and bus drivers will lose their jobs. Yes, that is most likely true but they will create so many more jobs. The amount of jobs created will be more than the ones lost. As Spock once said ""The needs of the many outway the needs of the few, or the one.""

People are getting lazier and lazier, they don't want to drive themselves anywhere anymore. This is one of the reasons that we need driverless cars. As society evolves we see that people are getting lazier. Lazy people don't want to drive anywhere. This is where driverless cars come in. Driverless cars will take lazy people who don't pay attention to their destination safely and without accident. People might say that driverless cars end up making people lazier by allowing them to do little to nothing and still get where they want to go. Yes, people might get lazier but it is better than people dying form crashing their car.

Driverless cars will save lives of people who would otherwise die in a car crash. Driverless cars will create jobs for people who need jobs. Driverless cars will also help people who are very lazy. These reasons and many others is why we need driverless cars. Driverless cars are the future.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

My personal opinion is that that it would be nice have. It would help people get place to place if they are nervous drivers. But I also think that there will be many flaws to this investment. There will most likely be accidents an mobile disfunctions. The manufactures of the cars will just have to be perpared for improvments and better qualities.

People will be giving ideas and wants for the cars too. My biggest concern is what if the driver happens to fall asleep and be heavy sleeper. The car has to wake up the driver but what if the driver sleeps through the warning? This could cause safety problems. I think only certain people should get these cars. Only older people that cant get around like they used to, teens or adults that are learning how to drive, and nervous drivers should use the driverless car.

There are many Pros and Cons about having the car. If the manufactures have proof that the cars will bee 100 percent safe then i would be definatly ok with them being on the roads.

BC61B07C351D,"Through the past century, mechanization on a global scale has indubitably innovated the world in efficency and economic progress. In particular, however, the key invention of the car has solely shown the benefits of such techonological progress. For a few innovators, the mere invention of cars did not seem convincing enough, hence the creation of driverless automobiles has been in design to furtherly increase efficiency and safety. Although the benefits of adopting driverless cars in society seem convincing in progressing society, ultimately, the implementation of driverless cars will only entail disaster.

A strong factor contributing to the cons of driverless cars is the undeniable usage of human skills throughout the road even with using driverless cars. Although the term ""driverless car"" may seem like a straight-forward terminology, it is in reality not. Currently, there is no such development of a car that completely remains independent of the car passenger. On paragraph 7 it notes, ""None of the cars developed so far are completey driverless."" Morever, due to the fact that driverless cars cannot function completely by themselves, this requires that human passengers still have to be attentive at all times.

As continued on paragraph 7 it states, "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" In summation, this means the human driver must continue to remain alert and be ready to take over the wheel if the driverless car cannot deal with a specific situation. Despite that driverless cars can permform tasks independently, it is only to a limited extent. Therefore, this still requires the full attention and driving skill set of the car driver. If this still requires the full attention and driving skills of the car driver, the invention of the carless driver, in reality, has no useful benefits. The driver therefore, still has risks of getting into car accidents because they still need to rely on their driving abilities, rendering the invention of driverless cars ineffective.

The most important factor of all in contributing against the promotion of driverless cars however, is the idea of fault. On paragraph 9, a controversial question is brought up, asking ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If a driverless car were to get into an accident and if someone were to be injured as a result, who's fault would it ultimately be? This serious and controversial argument as a result, creates a prodigious amount of conflict, particularly between drivers and manufacturers. Because driverless cars are most of the time, indepent of the car drivers, an accident caused by this invention will guaranteed cause a difficulty in finding who is truly at fault. On one hand, it could have been the driver himself for not paying attention to the road and altering the mechanics of the driverless car. However on the other hand, it could have been a completely honest mistake, where the driverless car itself commited an automated mistake that did not associate with the actions of the car driver.

Driverless cars in conclusion, make it difficult to assert the blame on whos truly at fault in a driverless car accident, therefore making it extremely more difficult in handling and resolving this situation.

Without driverless cars, there will only be one to blame and therefore, more problems will be resolved.

Lastly, the existence of traffic laws and working zones on the roads is prominent in abasing the efficency of driverless cars. On paragraph 9 it says, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" In other terms, common aspects of the road, such as traffic laws and working zones, are designed so that only human drivers can handle those situations, thus making driverless cars useless. In these terms, this means that alert drivers will perform much more reliably than an automated car because the road and traffic laws are set up so that the only safe car is a car where a human driver is in control at all times. Because driverless cars are incapable of handling such pivotal features of the modern road system, they must still rely on their human drivers, contradicting their own title of ""driverless"" cars. In conclusion, because the driving laws of the road are mainly designed so that safety will be best achieved with alert human drivers, the implementation of driverless cars in modern society is utterly useless.

Due to the manifestations of human action-based driving laws, continued necessity for human driving skills, and no exact blame for fault in a driverless car accident, the addition of driverless cars into society will only bring increased harm and debatable increased efficiency.

The addition of fully driverless cars is currently only fantasy, and should remain this way eternally.                         ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
D43FC8D240E4,"I believe that we should not use driverless cars, in my opinion they are an accident wating to happen. The arguments saying we should switch to driverless cars sound far fecthed. The text uses statements such as, ""the cars would use half the fuel of todays cars"", ""they offer more flexibility"", and that ""they are much safer"". These arguments are invalid in many ways that I will explain.

They text says that driverless cars would be cheaper than cars that require a human to handle them, but they are not. Driverless cars aren't even driverless, they still require a human skill to take over when the car cannot comprehend what to do next. Driverless cars would be much more expensive to obtain and operate than a normal car. Driverless cars have many different extremely expensive gadgets needed to even make it semi-automatic, they require position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor. A normal human operated vehicle does not require any of those things, so if a person did wish to get a driverless car, they would be paying a substantial amount of money and even more for fuel, to keep up with the parts and technology, and for gas. With a manual car all you have to do is purchase it (for a much smaller amount) and pay gas money and body shop bills should they arise, but still yet, it would be a lot less than the driverless car.

The text also states the driverless cars offer more flexibility than a manual car, this is untrue, they actually offer less. With a manual car, you are the driver and you choose where to go and what to do, with the driverless car you are supposed to tell your GPS where to take you and that's all the input you have. But what if the place you are trying to go is on a road that doesn't show up on the GPS? Now that driverless car is pretty useless. They are much less flexible than a man powered vehicle and much less reliable.

Lastly, the text states that driverless cars are much safer than manual ones, this is invalid. Their arguments for such a statement are, ""driving in a fun new way"", ""you can have in-car entertainment"", and ""you would be able to text and drive"". These are crazy reasons that a driverless car is safe. First of all, driving doesn't need to be fun, you just need to get from point A to point B. Secondly, there should be no in-car entertainment. Playing games, watching tv, etc. should not be done while driving, because the ""driverless car"" still needs to be operated by a human, this is a deadly distraction. And again, with the texting a driving, this is a lethal distraction that should not be suggested to do, even in a driverless car. If you were to be texting you may not notice your driverless car signalling you to take over, and consequently, you will be in a wreck.

In conclusion, driverless cars should be kept a thing you see in movies, fictional. There are too many risks and dangers to a driverless car and the price would be unaffordable for most. The driverless car is an unthoughtout idea that makes no sense. There are too many problems with the driverless vehicle for it to be reliable and safe, so we need to stick with the manual cars instead. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless cars are a interesting subject to speak about, they are said to come in the near future, as stated by Sebastian the founder of the Google Car project, but are they really safe. Driverless cars have always been a fascinating idea in televison, but they seem to be dangerous, expensive, and interface with the law.

Driverless cars are amusing to those who look forward to this new technology, and its unreal and amazing that a car drive it's self, but is it safe? ""Driverless cars"" at the time seem to already struggle with the navigation and attention of the driver to prevent accidents from occuring. As stated by the article, "" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Driverless cars today aren't all that beneficial and requiredue the attention of drivers, how can we be positive that the new cars said to come will be ready to prevent accidents without the requirence of human attention? Not only do these cars seem to be safeless, but due to all that worl that is said to come and all the new technology, dont they seem expensive and out of reach?

The driverless cars are said to come, but with the technology that will be invested into this project, it seems to be out of reach from those who are interested. As stated by the article, ""...but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters, they needed a whloe lot of sensors."" This shows that the ""driverless cars"" today needed a lot of work put into them, and gives a view of how these cars were made and now compared to the soon to come real driverless cars, how much will be invested for someone who is interested.

Who will be responsible for the occurence that has happened? As stated by the article, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?""

As technology advances we see many new inventions and usful things come into our lives. Some of these things can cause a harm to the people in different ways, but some are things that will change the way we look at life, one invention that will change all of peoples lives forever, in the good way, is the driverless car. These cars will change how we as a people go about our every day lives and how we handle ourselves.

There are quite a few major benifits to the driverless car, for instance, the cars will be able to cut down on the amount of injurys and even deaths for texting and driving. Instead of having to try and drive while answering a text message people will be able to look down and talk on the phone while the car in driving itself. Another way this car will benifit us is how effective it will be at cutting down pollution. The driverless cars will cut the gas used in half in major areas where taxi's are one of the main sources of transportation. This will help the entire planet by cutting down the hurt on the ozone layer.

This car has other benifits as well. Such as it's constantly updating 3-D sensors that make the car aware of what is around it. This improves safety and the reliablity of the cars giving the person in the car more confidence in what it is doing. The cars also contain a feature that would alert the person in the car if there was something coming up that the car may not be able to handle on its own. This improves safety and majorly brings down the amount of crashes.

However, these cars are not perfect by any means. They are sitll a work in progess meaning they will have some difficulties, or things that would hold them back. One of those things being that even thought the cars dont have a driver needed most the time, they will still need the drivers to take over in some situations. These include times when they are approaching a car accident or road work. They will have to be driven by the driver to get around it. They also have a confusing part to them. If they do in fact get into an accident whose fault would it be? The human who owns the car or the manufacturer? This could cause for some long and dramatic legal cases no body wants to deal with.

The advancment in technology in recent years has led to many ground greating discoveries. With the way we are headed we may be in store for a world full of technology.

84956A4FA804,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future. Maybe even the near future. Since 2009, certain people have been testing driverless cars. Except, they aren't quite there yet. The cars still require human assitstance in difficult situations that the driver can't handle. But is it a good idea? Can we rely on computers to do something that can be dangerous? The answer is no.

Humans have faults. So do computers. A computers doesn't have the traits it needs to be able to drive someone. Not to mention, the whole process of making an almost driverless car is expensive. There simply isn't enough money to manufacter that many cars to drag people around.

Another issue is the driving itself. The cars they are testing today do not have certain abilities that humans do, such as parking, driving in difficult traffic, or going around accidents. Of curse they have sensors to alert the driver. But how alert will they be? A car can drive itself for most of the time, so why pay attention? It could be very dangerous if the human at the wheel isn't alert. Accidents will be prone to happen, and there may even be more accidents than we have now.

A present problem that is also important is traffic law. Trafic laws are written to make the assumption that a safe human driver is in control at all times and is keeping themselves and the pasengers safe. Places such as California, Nevada, florida, and the District of Colombia even outlawed the testing of computer driven cars. This proves as a giant red flag of if we should have computer driven cars or not. The manufacturers assume the laws will be changed in the future. But if there is an accident, is the driver or creator of fault? The creator of course. There's no doubt that in advertising the car, the manufacturers promised safety and reliability. But that didn't happen, and the driver wasn't at fault. It was the computer for not doing what it was supposed to do.

In conclusion, driverless cars controlled by computers is a bad idea. It is expensive, dangerous, unreliable, and shouldn't be tested for.       ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

These cars, ""allowing far better response and control than a human driver,"" are making the roads safer. The sensors and technology in these cars and so fast to act because of their programming that a human could not manage to keep up. Manufacturers are working on ""bringing in-car entertainment"" which will make the experience in one of these driverless cars even more enjoyable. The vehicle is coded to alert the driver and shut off all entertainment systems when it is in a position in which the driver must regain control.

The workload of the dirver for a roadtrip in minimized to a point where they are in control a very small percentage of the time. Roads become safer due to the sensors and code in the cars which allow them to react faster than humans.

With all of the improvements on the driverless car the car will be safer. They have invented a track that sends signals to a reciever on the front end of the car. The reason for this is the senors to alert the driver. The senors tell the driver what is all around them. They have developed senors to help alert the driver whne something bad is about to happen. The senors have become more advanced, and are able to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. The information from the senors can make the car apply the brakes on the individual wheels and reduce the engine's power. The most important piece of technology is the Dubbed LIDAR. It uses laser beams to scan 3-D images of the car constantly. This allows the car to have a better response and control than a human driver alone. General motors has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. With all of the new technolgy being developed, these driverless cars will be safer.

The car could glitch, or, freeze in the middle of the road and create a terirble accident that could lead to death. ther are too many negative outcomes towards the car , that, changing the world that much right now, or, even in the near future is too much to try, and handle. There are too many other things going on in the world then to worry about making a car that does not need a human driver to operate it. Even if the car is made correctly , many people will not have money to pay for it. Other than safety there are other things to worry about such as exspenses. then after exspenses ,how much mooney wil be going into having enough supply, product, and inventory for many people to have the car. Then, they would have to worry about how much fuel the car would need, or how much elecricity the car would need in order to be operated. People try to come up with differnt ways to make so much money, they try to make it seem like they are right in what they are doing but in all reality some things can be a joke. The driverless car tempts death. the car does not sound too convincing for many people to pay for it .

Although, in many peoples mind, the idea of a driverless car seems to be more efficient, does not mean it is more safe. The driverless car can change the world really quickly and it can change the world into being alot worst than what it is. The next invention might be robots for every household, and that can lead to many downfalls. The driverless car is inspiring many other ideas that are not safe . What can be depicted from the passage is, that, transportaion isses will be handled more efficiently. Anyone who is in their right mind would not buy such a product. Risking many epoples lives just so that an ""interesting' product is out on the streets is not an idea that needs to be supported at all.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9715D8D6F842,"I think that the idea of driverless cars are a good idea, but I don't think they are necessary at all. They are pointless and cars should be driven manually. The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen.

A good opposition to the idea of driverless cars is the psychological aspect. In the passage, it says, ""psychological aspects are really a challenge,"" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. The driverless cars are still going to require gasoline as fuel.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not worth the investment. They will still need human assistance and drivers will be bored waiting for their turn to drive. The amount of gas needed will still be the same to power all the cars. This is why driverless cars are pointless.                         ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

I don't think it is necesary for any one. the people nw just think it do more stof but the don't think what we will do with all the things what we don't need and maybe in this world we dont have pace jus for put all that.

Why this people no think about the people who need help? why they need all time new cars but what about the people who don't have house or food? it is a better ide than just a new cars, for what? more cars if we have a lot.

Now we have all forms for go contry by country but why the don't think in someting more special, more important like help other countrys. Not with just one little part I mean if we don't need something new why we use why we don't buy some clothes or seme shoes for wo need it?

It is more easy and better for allthe people in the world.

They would also make traveling more effecient and fun. The advancement of driverless farm equiptment already exists and is very useful and efficeint for big time farmers. They can plant and plow fields throught the use of GPS and an automated oporating system. Driverless cars could be used the same way, but instead of planting a field they would take you to your friends house. With driverless you wouldn't have to worry about directions, all you would have to do is put in your destination and the cars would find the quickest route by itself. You wouldn't have to worry about being distracted because the car dives itself. The only time when you would need to be paying attention is when there was hazards or construction areas.

In the future I think everyone will have self driven cars and driving will only be as useful as reading a book: you need to know how to do it, but there is no need to. This future is getting closer and closer every day. I think that in ten years these cars will be cheap enough that people will consider buying them instead of a normal car.

663BFA22A265,"I feel that driveless cars are needed for the world it would change the world as we know it. In these cars there are sensors that can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

These cars are very important because they can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. The cars can also steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, nut all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

Even though the human driver has to be alert at all times to be ready to take over this necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs. Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use heads up displays such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.

So honestly I feel that dispite some of the flaws that these cars may have it can still keep you safe. Even when you back up your car will let you know if your gonna hit an object such as a car or predestrian.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
CC4EEADA5262,"Driverless cars are very unecessary and will only cause trouble that can be avoided. These cars are unecessary, because driving is not one of the huge problems in the world. A lot of other issues should be viewed as more urgent to take care of, than the development of cars that do not need people behind the wheel and in control. They will only cause problems, because they can easily get into accidents, among many other issues. It was just spoken about this week in the news: Google's car got into its first accident.

In order to completely transfer over to driverless cars, a lot of things have to be changed and developed. Not only are the cars themselves problematic (they are not even able to react around an accident site), but there are no laws stating who is responsible if a vehicle with no driver causes an accident to happen. Who is held responsible in the end? A prediction some can make is that many lawsuits will be formed against both the maker of the vehicle, and the driver behind the wheel. The question will also arise that if neither were in control, can you blame something such as a car? Another problem that the cars could create, is a huge spending issue. In the article it is stated that a certain device ""cost two hundred million dollars."" That is a lot of money to spend on the system for one car. And the cars need many sensors in order for them to run smoothly, such as,"" a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors,"" and that might be roughly half of all one car needs. Another problem that could arise is the conditions of roads. Many of the driverless cars that the article states have been developed have needed specific conditions in order to function correctly, such as ""a special test track"" or ""magnets with alternating polarity."" How would those cars function in an everyday situation out on the open road? Not very well. So how would they be able to develop a vehicle that can operate on a true highway, as well as on the many other types of roadways in the world? An issue that should be brought up also, is that none of the developed vehicles have been completely driverless. They need humans to do certain things for them behind the wheel, such as navigating crash scenes. What happens if a driver who is bored while their car drives for them forgets to be paying attention?

In conclusion, driverless cars are not something that should be stood for. They will only create trouble that is not needed in the world, and can possibly lead to way bigger issues, such as in our economy. The development and actual distribution of these cars would be something unprecedented and who knows what could come of unprecedented things. In reading this article, it was easy to pick out things that could go wrong, and reasons it would not be in the world's best interest to go further in the development, but it was a lot harder to pick out what could go right and how these cars could help the world.

First reason why I am against the development of this car is because of money. Some places there may not be enough money or room to even consider doing this project. Also, some people won`t do it because they want to drive, or feel comfortable driving their own car.

Second, it may cause many wrecks. The car itself may be fit and ready, but it may cause wrecks because of weather conditions or the car itself can`t control itself. I also believe people wouldn`t trust something like this. Yes, I have to admit that this car is cool, but many people will not agree to do this.

Why spend so much money and time in trying to develop something , when theres no garrented that anybody will buy them or they will even function properly . Its just telling drunk drivers or high drivers to get behind the wheel of a car , Nothing bads going to happen your not driving so nothings your fault .

Second , Are traffic laws were made to keep pedestrains , drivers , and passengers safe . In this article "" Driverless Cars Are Coming "" They give you a question "" who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer ? "" . When anything bad happens on the road , I feel as if its the manufacturer falt . They basically say there is no need in watching the road when you drive now are cars will take car or everything ; Eat , talk , text , sleep , smoke , do as you please . They have flashing lights , entertainment , information systems that use heads-up display to warn a driver when he or she must take over . With knowing this drivers really wont pay attention now a lot horrible things can happen , The only thing that will improve is how one can drive perfectly in a straight line .

Thrid , How do we even know the driverless car works right ? How do we know it wont malfunction ? KIll us ? or even catch its ownself on fire ! We know nothing of this driverless car and what its truly capable of . Can it stop correctly at a stop light or a yeild sigh , Can it reprogram to drive itself at the right speed limit . Slow down when a pedestrian , dog , raccoon , or even a squirral has entered the road .

lastly ,

The traffic laws are fine they prevent dangrous accidents already , Everybody follows then an know them ; and those who don't follow get a free trip the the police station . Why confuss people , switch , or even change some laws to protect the driverless car and its manufacturer .

B99A12610C04,"Having driverless cars can vitally affect the world. Athough there are upsides to having them, there is also a lot of negative things that can result. I personaly think it is a bad idea to have driverless cars. The reasons for that being, if there is a software malfunction who is to blame, it takes away the fun and personal experiance of learning to drive, and there is not a way to prevent the car from malfunctioning.

Who is to blame for a crash when the cars are self driving? That question would be asked by anyone who experiances a crash with these cars. The government could make the civilian pay for the damages, or they could hold the manufacturer responsible. But, who would stop the manufacturers from sueing the civilian in the car and trying to make them pay for damages. Without any law to decide who is to blame there would be people sueing and blaming eachother to avoid paying.

Having driverless cars would also take away the experiance of learning to drive a car. Driving has always been something teenagers look forward to doing because it makes them feel free and like they have control over something. Without this, what would they look forward too? Learning to drive is also a great bonding experiance between parent and child and a wonderful way to pass on knowledge.

How would we be able to prevent the car from malfunctioning and causing a crash, or what if someone hacks the system to cause a car to crash? Having a computerized car with no way of letting humans take control would just be leeting in people to cause issues. If the president is in a car and someone hacks they syatem they can easily make the car crash killing the president. Unless they find a way to prevent this then there would be no order, and even id they put a one of a kind security system in it there is still no garentee that it wont get hacked.

There are some good things to having driverless cars though. Like how it would be safer without the risk of drunk drivers. Another good thing stated in the text is how they plan on making them use less gas than cars today, but couldnt they just make normal cars use less gas instead of making driverless cars? There is just so many small things that could cause big issues that the good from this is out weighed by the bad.

Having these self driving cars is just opening the door for issues to come through. Without clear laws on who is to blame for a crash, there is an opening for instability. There is no way for us to prevent people from hacking into a car's system and causing it to malfunction, killing those inside. Taking away the experiance from teenagers of feeling free to go where you want and destroying the chances of bonding with them through teaching to drive is just wrong. although it could be safer at some times there are also so many problems that can occur. Do we really want to take such big risks, just for a few small rewards?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
D9ED0ECD0C56,"Have you ever thought what it would be like to get behind the wheel and not have to drive? Well in this day and age that might be a very real possibility. Technology is getting more and more advanced these days and car companies are working on cars that drive themseleves. I believe that would be very cool to have a car that could drive on it's own for the most part at least. Google has made cars that are mostly driverless except when you have changing road conditions such as construction or an accident. These cars work pretty good too. It's been tested and has driven over a half a million miles accident free.

I think driverless cars could be very beneficial because say your out drinking or you can't drive for some reason this car could take you home instead of having to call a cab or someone to pick you up. Also the could be used to teach people how to drive. You can put them behind the wheel and just let them get a feel of what it's like to have your hands on the wheel and feel the car turn and drive.

Other potential uses for a driverlees car could be preventing accidents. They could make cars with such good reaction time that it would stop before a human could possibly do it. I mean the car may need help with stuff like pulling in and out of driveways, but it can do stuff that most have trouble doing like parallel parking.

Before they allow these cars out on the road first they have to get rid of some of the laws and regulations about driverless automobiles. Like if a driverless vehicles is in an accident who's fault is it? The car owner or the company that made the car? These kind of things need to be sorted out before they can start allowing these vehicles on the street.

I think driverless cars will eventually become allowed on roads and highways everywhere. But it might take awhile to finish some of the issues and concerns with the cars and the laws. But eventually people will get asked how they got to work or school instead of saying they drove they will say my car drove me.    ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless cars are a great way to get from point a to b without even having to touch the wheel once. You wouldn't have to worry about your driverless car being in an accident, since the manufacturers have designed it with many sensors to enhace the efficiency and quality of your car, so it can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. There are many benefits from driverless cars, for instance you could go on a road trip and you wouldn't have to touch the wheel once. Also with driverless cars you could get many new features like in-car-entertainment and information systems that use head-up displays so the driver doesn't get bored. Other benefits are like added cameras to the car so the driver can stay focused on the road while the car drives by itself. But with many machines,eletronics, etc. There will always be many cons. Some cons of the driverless car is when it gets into a traffic jam, the driver will have to take the wheel and drive. Another con is sensors could go bad and cause the driverless car to not peform at its potential and creating hazards to other cars or pedrestians.

Driverless cars will help the economy increadibly. They will cut the public transportation costs in half! The cars are not fully functional by them selfs so far, they need the help of a driver to navagate through complicated traffic conditions. These cars will take over the wheel when you do not want to drive.

Some say that the driver would get bored waiting for ""their turn to drive"". Also others say it would not be fun sitting watching the car drive. But what they do not know is the developers have allready looked into that problem. The answer is a digital display windsheild, you can watch a movie on your window. You can call or text from your car as it is driving. So when it is your turn to drive the display would turn off and it would tell you that you have to take over.

The technology for this to happen is here, all the developers need is your help to see if the people would want them. Imagin not having to worry about crashes, speeping drivers, drunk drivers, or taking the wrong way home. This car will eliminate thoes senarios. Less speeding tickets you have to pay, less insurance, and less money to spend on gas.

Safety issues, misuse/abuse, and new ways of the road. All for the fact people don't want to drive themselves or it will be safer? I don't think so!

I have several reasons why I think driverless cars are pointless. Now, would it be cool to just take a nap and let the car control itself and take you to your destination? Yes, but in that case you would have to have a car that is actually able to drive itself. The cars are said to win people over if and when they are proven safe. The key word there ""when"". Sometime in the future driverless cars may become a big thing but right now they are not ready to be put on the road so I don't even think it is an idea worth proposing to the world.

Driving or asisting? If a car is designed to drive itself going 25 miles per hour or slower where are you going that you are only going 25 miles per hour it can't be very far. Funny thing is you are supposed to be alert just in case an obstacle such as a traffic jam or an accident occurs. How is it ""Driverless"" if there has to be a driver. Why not just drive the car yourself?

That is like having a self filling water bottle but you have to turn on the sink to fill it up. Also the cars would probably be used for people to sleep or just think they can relax while letting the car drive. No that is going to lead to accidents and wih a car thats supposed to be runnig itself whose to blame in an accident and how can you prove who was at fault. Here is wherre new laws would have to come in. To prove whose fault there would have to be a camera in the car recording to insure the driver was alert and it wasn't a manufacturing issue. Then isn't that invading one's privacy? Laws would have to change and there would be so many execptions due to liability and how to prove who is at fault.

I just do not think ""driverless cars"" are necesary especially when they don't own up to their name! Now if people could understand the car is asisting and not driving then i dont feel there would be an issue considering you have to be driving the so called ""driverless car"".

3167F4C6194C,"New cars that drive on their own, sounds fun right? Well think again. Diverless cars should not be used thoughout the world. Diverless cars are not counted as driverless because people will still have to take control of them while in traffic zones, and during other occasions. Not everyone will be able to afford one of these driverless cars so people who usually ride in taxes or buses will no longer have that option. Also, cameras were thought of to be put in these cars to watch divers to make sure people are paying attention even though they are not driving to insure their safety if the driver has to take control, but that is invasion of privacy.

Why would you go out to buy a car that is ""driverless"" when you need to still have to drive it at any given time, and still have to watch the road? That defeats the whole purpose of having a car that drives on it's own. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" It says ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills, such as navagating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"".

If driverless cars become the new car than many people who take the bus, and ride taxis will be unable to have rides to their locations anymore. Especially if all other types of cars are got rid of. A lot of low income families rely on a taxi, train, bus, or even a subway as a cheaper way to get around because they cannot afford a car. That means they would be walking while higher class people are riding in a driverless car. The argument for supporters of driverless cars was ""The cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" Still it does not change the matter that people would still have to walk to get to where they need to go if they cannot afford a driverless car.

Some people believe that diverless cars will be a good thing because it is a peak of our technology, they also think that the driverless cars will be able to help people stay focused on the road just as the article says ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" But that statement is not exactly true. If a person is put in a car that drives on it's own they are going to get more distracted and choose to be on their phones rather than paying attention to their surroundings because a driverless car is made to, drive on it's own.

That is why driverless cars should not be made, or even thought to be created. In reality, they are a distraction, they do not fufill their purpose, and they would end up costing way more than they are worth. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
77C96D44E42C,"In this essay I will be explaining reason from my own point of view and from the story on why I do not think that these kind of vehicles should be created. I will give and back up my reasons on why I disagree with the making of these cars and also state items that were adressed in the passge that I agree with on why these type of cars should not be manufactured.

I disagree that these type of vehicles should be created for many reasons. The main reason is safety. Sure the cars will be able to drive by them selfs at time but that doesn't mean that they will never make mistakes. On a rainy day say you have the car drive by itself for a bit and you just lean back and relax for an hour or two. At any point between the 1 to 2 hours that car could say malfunction and crash hurting you and any other person inside that care. Weither it is just a little fender bender with another car or you total both of the cars and critically injure someone. My secondary reason is explained in the passage we were given to write about. Technology in cars has been growing in cars for the past couple of years varly rapidly. But as the author of the passage states the technology may not always be reliable of efficient in situatuions. The author also states that they car will have the human driver take control if coming to a constructuin site or a school crossing. What if at this time the human driver fell asleep while letting the car drive itself and doesnt tkae conrtol of the car at the correct time and crashes or hurts somebody.

Another reason I disagree withthe making of these kinds of vehicles is also explained in the passage. In paragraph 7 the author states something that I agree with completely. The author states in this paragraph that say someone let their car start to drive by itself and gets into an accident with another car. WHo is to blame for the accident, the human driver or the manufacturer who built the automatci driving system in the car? If you ask me I would have to say both the human driver and the car manufacture's are to blame. The human driver is to blame because if he or she were to be paying attention to what was going on around them they would have been able to react and see the oncoming car and could have possibly been able to avoid collision with the other vehicle.

Tyring to make cars more technology efficient is going to become a big concernin the furtre I think. Now a days we have things like the in-car phone system which myself and the author of the passage find to be very helpful and adds a little bit better percentage to teh safety of drivers when they are not trying to text and talk on their cell phones while driving. Adding this like self driving and automated brakes to cars can cause more safety issuses because they might not always work every time you try to use them.

8CD899D37F34,"Driverless cars are a good idea, but it has its flaws. Driverless are more prone to get into an accidents than cars with people actually driving them. First, the car is made up of a lot of sensors. The sensor on the roof is the most important one, and if that sensor gets damaged in any way the car couldn't drive itself. If someone was taveling on the road in that car, and the Rotating sensor stopped working then they would have to take over , and drive themselves. Also if a malfunction happened on a highway it can cause car crashes and such. While there are problems about the sensor privacy needs to be addressed too.

Privacy is a big thing too the ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining foucused on the road"" this shows that the manufactureres are watching people as they drive. People in the car would have no privacy cause the manufacturers are watching them. While privacy is a issue buying that can't drive itself is an issue too.

The car still ""requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" this shows that the driver must stay alert while its driving. Manufactueres have developed things to get people's attention whenever a problem occurs. Its like why would you pay for a driverless car that you still have to drive?

My second reason is too many driveless cars. If there were to make way too many drivless cars then it would alot of traffic because there are alot of cars who need a driver to drive. Such as if they were to go to the junk yard the junk yards would overflow and they would have to make more and more and less places to build houses or less crops for farmers.

My last reason is pollution. If aot of people bought all these driveless cars then so much pollution would comeup and take over the sky and people would get sick and die from breathing in the air. If they were to change gas into something else and something went wrong with the gas or something to run the cars, they would either blow up or cause to much pollution that they would have to refund all the people and people would stop buying these because they wouldn't trust them.

With a driverless car you don't have to worry about human mistakes, such as, someone picking up the phone and takings their eyes off the road; or someone putting on making up, brushing/combing their hair, or even eating while only keeping one hand attended to the wheel. A driverless car will alert the driver when there is danger ahead and will even come to a complete stop if necessary. Driverless cars won't run red lights, go over the speed limit, or even get out of control as a drunk driver would. Driverless cars is one of the many invention leading into the new world.

Cars that you won't have to drive is a good idea. I think they should be allowed in more states as long as they've been tested and proven to be safe. Driverless cars are hazardous free and economically beneficial, they would fundamentally change the world.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

If you are a business man and you're busy and you need to get things ready on your way to work driverless cars could help you out, but you still need to pay attention to the road because the driverless cars need to be controlled under certain circumstances.

Although their name is a driverless vehicle a driver still needs to operate it when needed such as when there is consruction or if there is a wreck in the middle of the road so the driver needs to pay attention even if he doesn't need to drive. The car will notify the driver if the road ahead requires human skills by either telling the driver or flashing lights on the dashboard.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passangers, and pedestians safe. Some states think the smart car may abstruct those laws such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. These states won't even allow computerdriven cars be tested. I think the idea of a driverless car is great but as you can see some other people don't.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
54F6AD35A8D1,"Driverless cars have the potential to be somthing great. These cars could make the road a safer place and save you money. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author makes points both for and againts driverless cars. Personally, I am for driverless cars.

Driverless cars could greatly reduce the amount of money spent on cars. Much like the cofounder of Google, Sergey Brin, I like the idea of being able to call for a driverless car. Sergey Brin foresees that these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis. Households could save the money they saved from not buying a car to go on a much needed family vacation.

Driverless cars could be much safer than a car driven by a human. These cars would have many sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius has a rotating sensor on the roof. While the human brain is amazing, it cannot process what is happening at all angles around the car. A hightened awareness of the car's surroundings could result in less wrecks. However, a human driver would still have to be in the front seat in case of an emergency.

Driverless cars could be intrumental in both long road trips and nights out. It can be very hard to stay awake when driving after a long day of work. The driverless car could drive while you doze off and has the ability to alert you when human supervision is needed. The same goes for long road trips. It is illegal and incredibly dangerous to drink and drive. With the driverless car, drinking and driving wrecks could be a thing of the past. After a night out you could crawl into your driverless car and be safe while it drives you home, given there is not a need for a human during the drive.

All in all, driverless cars could improve many aspects of life. The cars could save you money and allow you to rest after a long day. While there are still some risks associated with the driverless car, I believe the pros outweigh the cons.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

I would not feel comfertoble having a computer driving me around and deciding if it takes me through a bad naughborhood or if it takes the long way around.

If I were to be put in danger, would that compurter be able to get me out of that danger? I don't think so because, again, it is a programed computer. The car is programed to follow the laws set forth. If going over the speed limit to get away from a person trying to harm me or the people I am with is the way that we stay alive, then that's what needs to be done.

If the car is programed to go the speed limit, how many police officers would lose their job? There would be no speeding, so there would be no need to have them on the road as much.

What would happen if there was a fire? If the vehicls are programed to go the speed limit, how will the fire fighters get to the house on time? If there is an acident, because the person in the car has no control over it, how will the peramedics get to the scene on time?

If the car doors are locked and there is no way to get out in a crash, there will be more of a chance of people dieing from a car crash than before the cars come out. The officers would have to cut the person out, if that can be done. If the crash is so bad that the person can't be cut out what does that say about cars manufacturer?

Driveless cars are a big deal in our modern ,new and innovating society. We try to grow and improve every single and ask ourselves how we can change. Many companies such as Google, Audi and Nissan have an idea that could possibly change the world. Driveless cars are what we all have been waiting for ages. Though many people agree with the idea that driveless cars are the next big thing others simply disagree. There are many pros and cons with the innovation of this project.

I agree with the idea that we should try our best get some driverless cars out on the streets. We as the people on Earth should want the world to grow bigger and better, to grow brighter and smarter. Look at us today, we would not have had many of the things we now do if we had never put so much effort on it. Forexample computers, cell phones and even the process harvesting crops. A lot of ideas have bloomed from technology.

Technology plays a major role in our life, and if driverless cars are the next new idea then I fully support it. Just image how much driverless cars could impact our everyday lives. It could make public transportation so much innovative and easier. perhaps driverless cars can lower are car crash and violence rates on our roads. Driverless cars could also help out many people who are hurt or in desperate need of help in certain situations. Driverless cars could be healthier for our enviornment, but who will ever know if do not put time into this project.

Although having driverless cars are great many do not agree. They believe that it is something dangerous and something that nobody should mess with. They believe that it is out of this world and we should not put any money into this project. I agree that this project can fail but atleast we can say that we tried it, right?

We as human beings learn from our mistakes and as of now there are companies like Google who are already making a change. They have dedicated hundreds of hours into cars who today have driven themselves with a passenger more than half a milliion miles without a single crash.

The have asked themselves that same question and now we have electric cars, cars with sensors and cameras, cars with gps. We have alerts systems in our cars now which keeps us safer. A couple of years ago we had none of these things.

Driverless cars are in the near future. People have dedicated so much time and knowledge to improve are generations to come. There is always something new to improve so lets let it be cars for now, 2020 you are just around the corner. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless cars aren't safe. You still cant juss not take the wheel ,cause at one point of time in the car you will. Manufacturers have not got everything right in the car. Driverless cars still need way more sensors. Sensors to indicate every turn and stop there is . I belive that it wasnt a very smaert idea to make a car that you cant controll.

Not no one else or something controlling it .You might as well say your in a taxi, not your own car.

A human must still be presant so they can take over and drive if the car needs to park or is having trouble in traffic. This new driverless car is still rather new and I think it puts people in danger.

Imagine if this self moving car has a mess up or is a little damaged and it goes out of control. The human inside the car might not be paying enough attention to realize the car needs help. I believe that if you were to allow people to have a self driving car they would eventually lose the feeling of responsibility . Although the car is able to drive to certain places, due to its computer programming, people might over look that they still must be focased and ready to drive.

The new cars will notify you if it needs you to take over. This is helpful but still a large risk . Censors do have the ability to mess up and cause crashes. I dont see why they are trusted. In the article ""driverless cars are coming"" it states ""if technology fails and somone is injured , who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer."" this only adds to my point of lack of saftey.

Driverless cars would provide easy transporation by the user would get in the car and the car would drive to where it's programmed to go. The user would just have to sit back and enjoy the ride while the car did all the work. This would make for a easy and relaxing source of transportation.

Furthermore, these high tech vehicles would include safety precautions. They are said to have seats that vibrate or annoucements on when the driver should take over. These cars would also include many precautions and feautures that would appeal to the buyer of the car. Driverless cars would not be allowed to be sold if they did not come with verified safety precautions.

In addition, driverless cars would benefit the lives of the elderly and disabled tremendously. Some elderly and disabled people do not have the freedom of driving. They may be prescribed by a doctor not to or they might not be able to see as well as the average person. Therefore with the new innovation of driverless cars they would have the opportunity to drive as well.

They would cause many deaths and they can cause a lot of harm.

They can also cause a lot of crashes.

Also, most people dont have a fast reflex to prevent crashes.

They are going to cost a fortune to keep producing them and a lot of money to produce the kind of road for the kind of car.

The cars will cause many deaths because a computer is controling it and the car wouldent stop where its supposed to stop due to a mistake in their sensors.

That can also happen due to the driver not paying attention to the road. The person driving could push the limit of the car and anything could happen.

The car would lose control and crash killing some people.

The cars are going to cost a fortune due to road improvements.

Also the materials needed for the sensors which cost about two hundred million dollars.

This just goes to show how much the cars will cost.

The car also needs to be fixed sooner or later so the car's parts will cost a fortune to get.

If the car is crashed who could you blame?

The people driving the car or the people who created it?

this will be a big problem to the bisness owners if the car decides to malfunction and cause a lot of damage or cause a life to end.

The car could be damaged and the driver would not know because the person is not controling it but the comoputer is.

Hacking is also a big problem in this world and if Google decides to sell this car, hackers could take control of it.

These cars could be a potential thret to the environment and to inocent people.

Google cofunder Sergey Brin believes in the driverless car and the safty of one. However, I strongly disagree with his outlook on the driverless car.

In paragraph seven the author displays one issue that makes these type of cars problimatic. This issue is that the cars still need assistance when it comes to applying human reasoning and human skills that a robot cannot control. This is where my concern for the safety of the cars is tested. What would happen if the car did not recognize the situation as a human task? Would the car be able to react like a human being? To me, the answer is no, i believe that a robot cannot be taught to think and perform like a human being.

In paragraph nine the law is the issue that is explained. In the article it states that that there is uncertainty between who would be responsible for injuries in an accident, the driver or the manufacturer? In my opionion this makes the cars even more of a threat. What if the manufacturer was to blame? Would individuals be more likely to get in an accident just for the money? Also presented in article nine is that in most of the states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars. Society does not trust the saftey of these cars so why should we.

37848FC43982,"Are cars necessary in today's society? Of course they are necessary. Now, are driverless cars necessary? I would argue that they are not. Cars have been around for about a hundred years, and not once has society put its foot down and demanded a car that drives itself. The driverless cars this article discusses are not actually driverless, they are not legal, and there is no telling what future problems may arise.

Shouldn't a truly driverless car not require a human at all? I personally believe a driverless car should be able to navigate itself without human interferance. If it requires a human, then what is the point of calling it driverless? In fact, all the driverless cars being created right now are designed to notify the driver when it approaches a work zone or accident. So, in case the need to have a human take over arises, an individual would have to be sitting in the drivers seat, paying absolute attention to the road, and await the moment the car will allow the individual to take over. Wouldn't that take away the nejoyment of owning a driverless car? I believe it is even more of a hassle than driving ever would be. A person would have to fight boredom and remain alert while doing nothing other than sitting in the driver seat. To all driverless car companies: driving is paying attention to the road, but the driver is actually engaged, making driving more interesting.

Not only are driverless cars not fully developed, but they are not even legal. Most states do not allow driverless cars. In fact, most states do not even allow driverlesss cars to be tested on their roads. The article only mentions four places that allow driverless cars, and they only allow limited use. If these cars are not even allowed by most states to out on the road for testing, imagine how long it would take to pass laws to get these cars approved.

A myriad of problems could arise pertaining to driverless cars. The article mentioned a very real problem in driverless cars: if something goes awry and someone in injured, who is at fault? These cases would resort in major courtroom battles between average people and multi-million dollar companies. Another potential problem with driverless cars is the change off between driver and robot. If the car signals the driver and the driver does not respond, then what would the car do? A multitude of problems could appear, and all automakers can do is hope they will be abloe to find solutions to these probelms. To quote the article, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Not only are the companies unsure of what issues will surface, but they are not completely sure they will be able to find solutions.

Driving has been central to the American way of life for a large span of time, and if manually driving cars has been working, why change it? Driverless cars have been beiong tested since the 50's, so there clearly is no rush in getting these cars on the street. Also, once these cars are available to the public they will most likely only be accesable to the rich. In time the driverless cars would be more affordable, but the original prices would be high. Driverless cars are getting attention, but as soon as the public knows they will only be for wealthy hands for a bit of time, the excitment will die down.

The system works, and it works well, so why change it? Driverless cars may sound high-end and futurisitc, but our cars now do the job well. Plus, there are hazads and roadblocks the driverless cars will have to overcome first. Should we really make state legislatures waste time debating the use of a driverless car that is not completely driverless? Driverless cars have benefits, but they are not street legal.

The car will have a sensor the sensor has become advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. they also can cause the car to apply breaks on individule weelsand reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response and control than a human driver could mange alone. To make things more safe you are to be alert at all times its like going for a drive and relaxing but you know if you ever feel unsafe you can take over.

The cars are developing so fast not only google is making one as other car companys such as mercedes benz, audi, and nissan are putting in effort to make one by 2020. Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passagers, and pedestrians safe, and law enforcement know that the best way to get that is with an alert driver. the nlaw questions how they are going to get around the car such as if an axident happens. Who is reliable the driver or the maurfacture? even if traffic laws change new laws will need to be made in order to work with the cars. I belive if the car will make everyone more safe then it is worth it.

AA0DDBBBF74C,"Years ago, when cars were first being developed, the idea that one would be able to practically drive itself probably would've been thought of as crazy. Cars themselves are such a grand example of technological wonder that one being able to handle major tasks on its own just seems like too much. However, here we are in 2016, and the concept of driverless cars being produced in mass and becoming a new normal is a real possibility. A possibility that, in the realm of safety and advancement, is promising.

The concept of driverless cars is nothing but a good idea. The safety that these cars could create on the road if enough people used them could be huge for the prevention of car crashes in the future, maybe even bringing us to a world in which the horrors of such accidents no longer happen at all. Efforts by Google and other companies to make such a scenario possible are close enough now to make it look as if it could really happen, but they aren't quite there yet. There's still work to be done, but the progress made so far points to a bright future in the world of automotive technology and on-road safety.

As of right now, concept models of driverless cars aren't exactly as driverless as they need to be yet. Efforts the likes of BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" assume a lot of the driving workload, but can't handle everything that a human driver can. Driverless car technology as of right now as a sort've driving crutch for people. It can get the job done, but you'll have to put in some effort yourself to get the full results. Driverless car technology right now is more like advanced assistance than anything, which is still a good thing, but it isn't enough. Humans still have too much involvement in the process to really be able to deem this cars ""driverless."" However, these measures towards true driverless technology are still positive ones in the name of safety, so there really isn't anything wrong with them, it's just that there needs to be more. Things like suggested heads-up displays and vibrating driver's seats are helpful, but they still involve the driver too much for it to really make much practical sense in the long run if the end result is a real driverless car. I guess you can't climb a tree without first starting at it's base, though, so I can't bash on this advancements too much because, all in all, they are just that: advancements towards a much bigger future goal. Look at these advancements as stepping stones to the eventual goal of a totally driverless on-road experience.

Another thing to consider when looking at the issue of driverless cars is the lawful implications involved with them. If someone behind the wheel of one of these driverless cars were to get into a crash, who would be at fault? I agree with the writer of this article in that there is a clear-cut issue here currently. However, I think with further advancement of this technology, crashes would be a thing of the past regardless, so these issues wouldn't even pop up. More states need to give this technology a chance rather than just outright banning its practice so that companies can work out the kinks so that the issues this practice is being banned over would eventually be non-issues anyways. Give these companies enough time, and this whole ""who would be at fault"" thing would never need to come up again if they got their way with further investment into these driverless projects.

All things considered, I don't think that there's an issue these companies couldn't solve regarding possible safety or lawful issues regarding driverless cars if they were just given enough time and resources to work with. I realize that these cars aren't actually driverless yet in the grand scheme of things, and I realize that in their current state they could bring up issues of liability to the law. But, with enough time, both of these things are simply obstacles that could be toppled with new technology. These companies involved in the creation of driverless cars are doing what they're doing for the betterment of driver safety and striving for the safest driving experience possible. I think we as a society owe it to them to give them a fair amount of time to complete this goal in its entirety. What we are seeing now is just a peak at what I'm sure is coming out of this driverless technology research, and I'm excited for the future of this field of study and hope that maybe, by the time thoughts of my first car purchase come around, it could be a driverless one.

If they did, first of all, it would be cool to have cars that drive themsleves and second because if you needed to get somewhere and couldn't drive then you could. There are a few reasons why I think that they should be developed.

The first reason is because it would cost people a lot less to fill up their cars. They are also not fully driverless. They will alert you when you are pulling in or out of somewhere, or dealing with traffic issues such as construction or accidents. It feel that it could benefit a lot of people and would also make people more interested in driving.

They have been wanting to invent something like this one day. I knew that when they had the opportunity to create a vehicle or anything can can go on its own they would. This driverless car can apply brakes on individual wheels when needed too. It can also reduce power from the engine to help in the need of an emergency. This can help make driving safer because if someone isn't paying attention and a car or something is coming at you, your car can sense that and apply the brakes for you. It is nice that they are also considering using cameras in the cars to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. The car watches the driver and the driver watches the road.

Because of all the reasons I mentioned above, I think that they should develop the driverless car. It will be weird at first having these cars around because you wouldn't expect to see something like that but after a while it can benefit people in the long run that either can't drive like they used too and need to get somewhere, and also most will buy it just because it sounds super cool and to see what it can do.

One reason why this stands true is the ""Driverless Car"" was first discovered in movies and television. Taking something from an animated commercial, tv show, or movie and making it into something that we can use in real life could in some situations, be very complicated to do so. How would the car know when and where to come get you? Will they always be reliable? Often, some of todays people can't even trust that their cell phone is going to keep all of their information private. Making it hard to trust developing technology.

In addition, some of the ways that creators have come up with to make this happen is way out of our budget. As said in the section, instead of building ""smarter cars"" we could invest in building ""smarter roads"". This means that instead of putting all of the technology just in the car, it would also be included in the road system. This would cost millions, billions, maybe even trillions which is way out of our price range. The nation has too many things to take care of just to put all of our money towards something that we don't absolutely need.

Lastly, how would we know that the sensors built into the vehicle are going to work all the time? How would we trust them? Failed sensors could result in many incidents such as car accidents, fires, or car pile-ups. Even if we do develop the vehicle, we can't always trust it because accidents do happen. Using this car in todays society could risk many lives, even if we're not in the vehicle. Yes, it would be a success for our world of technology to make this happen.

A lot of technology has stopped working or can get broken and a lot of stuff can happen with one simple mistake. Now imagine that there would only be driverless cars, how ridiculous does that sound! How are the cars even going to know the laws?

Most people would say the car would have a computer that would know the laws. There's always new laws and how would the computer know the new ones? What if the computer gets the laws mixed up? A computer can stop working and you might not even know it! If a person mixes up the laws they can get a ticket or even get sent to court for not knowing them. It could keep the roads safer. The car messes up and what would happen? The car gets taken away? It goes to get fixed?

Most driverless cars that we have now, still need a driver. How pointless does that sound? Might as well just drive it yourself. Texting and driving is a big issue in the 21st century, people will think they can now text with the driverless car and won't even notice what's happening on the road. Driverless cars aren't going to make the world better and neither will they stop accidents from happening. Once a driverless car gets into an accident, no one will want one. I'm pretty sure it will happen someday and it would then be pointless to keep manufactoring them.

Driverless cars are just too much. It's like paying for a computer to drive you. You can't trust one! They might crash, break, and even do something you didn't tell it to do. Not everyone might agree with me, but I know for sure that no one would buy one after an accident happens. Please don't risk your life by buying a driverless car.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

They can also are not fully in control someone always have to be in alert and ready to take over. The also mentions 'safety is best enforce within alert drivers.""Driverless cars"" should stop being funded because it can cause an accident, a human will still have to be aware and ready to take over, and the law also states that.

Driverless cars sensors are nothing new of course, but they may also fail at occations. When sensors fail at anytime it may cause an accident. If the person in the vihcle dose not know what is going on it may lead to a extream unfortinit case. It may leave the passengers extreamly hurt, or even worst it may lose a life. In which case we do not want to occure. Technollogy may fail.

They are also not fully controlled on it is own. Someone always has to remain ready to take over when ever is needed. Why will someone want to do that when not having fully controlled or no controlled at all. People would offten lose sight of the road. People may also get annoyed. They also say that they may place cameras on vhicle to watch the driver stay foucesed on the road. If the car cannot do that on it's own i belive it should not be a car to be able to use.

Lastly the law it's own belives that 'safety is best reenforceed with drivers alert. When only people think that it is not quite a big deal but when the law belives the same way it is something major. As that have been said most states it is illegar to even test a driverless car. Some of those states are The distric of Columbia, California, Nevada, and also Florida. Whitch i agree and it is a great idea to enforce.

That is why Driverless cars should not be funded nor try to be created. Driverless car sensors may fail and can cause a tragic. They are also not self conntrolled on it's own. The law also said 'safety is best reenforce with alert drivers.'

DE4731F75934,"The positive things the author is saying about making driverless cars is more saftey because it got senses in it that can tell if you about to bag back into something it gives you a warning or if your going to fast it uses speed sensors to detect it and gives you a warning. If your brakes stop working while you driving it can detect it and use automatic break sensor to stop your car. The cars could handle the driving task on its own. It got a lot of sensors everywhere on the vehicle. It would have a video camera on the left rear wheel. A roatating sensor on the rood. Four automotive radar sensors. And it would have a GPS reciever. It will also have Dubbed LIDAR that have laser beams to form a constanly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. The negitive thing about having a driverless car is that it would take alot of upgrades and it would need smart-road systems. And the lawmakers says that the only safe way to keep drivers,passengers, and pedestrains safe is if the human driver is in control at all times. If the technology of the driverless car fails and someone is injured, they wouldnt know what to do because they wouldnt know who to blame. It could be the driver fault or the manufacturer. Some people wouldnt like a driverless car because they could get bored and tired of waiting for their turn to drive. And if any sensor breaks while the driverless car is going somebody could get hurt if any sensor is down. They don't got a back up sensor for none of the sensors.

6874FC63CF20,"Driverless cars may seem like a thing of the future, but they are much closer than most people seem to believe. Many different companies such as Google, Tesla, Audi, and many more have already built and tested their own models. However, many people are wondering whether self-driving cars are a help or a danger to society. Driverless cars are the next step in automotive technology and the research on them should continue because they will be safer and more efficient than cars driven by human drivers.

Every human makes a mistake at some point in his or her life. Whether they are distracted by something they see or they fall asleep at the wheel, people will make errors; it is part of our nature. On the other hand, computers function on data and do not make nearly the amount of mistakes as people. That is why self-driving cars will make roads safer and lead to less damage. Driverless cars take data they recieve from sensors, cameras, and GPS and they use this information to pick the smartest way to keep occupants safe on the road. Also the automated systems like driver assitance and antilock brakes that are already inside cars have proven that these programs will make driving safer. For example, antilock brakes function by detecting and then reacting to skids by apply brakes and reducing engine power. Therefore the driver is better able to avoid hazards and maintain control in dangerous situations. Google has also already tested some of their semi-driverless cars and these vehicles have not crashed in half a million miles. As proven by already installed automated features, technology will continue to make drivers and passangers safer. The next step in this technology is a self-driving car that will limit the amount of error that can be cost lives.

Another reason driverless cars should continue to be manufactered is that they will be more efficient and better protect the enviroment. Global warming is a problem that needs to be dealt with and one of the major culprits of it is the exhaust from diesel burning cars. The cars that Google is manufacturing are attempting to use half the fuel of a regular car while providing a safer function. With computers that can regulate exhaust, it is not too hard to imagine in the near future, if given more research, that a self-driving car could accomplish such a feat. Driverless cars would also be more efficient in that they would cut down on transportation time between destinations. Using GPS features, an autonomous car could calculate the quickest route to a destination and it would never miss a turn. Self-driving cars would not only be more fuel-efficient and help save the environment, but they also would be more time efficient.

Safety and efficiency are a few of the reasons why autonomous cars should continue to be reseached and developed. Many automoble manufacters are already producing mostly independent driving cars and soon they will become common place. By 2020 most major car producers plan to have a autonomous car model. That is not to say that everyone needs to have a self-driving, but those who do purchase one of these vehicles will not only help themselves, but they will also help others and the world around them.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

What if you needed to drive a long distance? woulden't it be better to sit back and let the car do the work? with a driveless car you can multi-task while your car is driving. For example, you can watch a movie, read a book, and even text while driving, and it will be completely safe.

driveless cars are safer than manual driven cars. texting and driving is a huge cause of death for teens in the US. With a driveless cars teens will be able to text thier friend or answer that important text, without running the risk of loosing their life or their car. Driveless cars will be able to sense things that the naked eye will not be able to sense. people get hit by cars all the time and kids get run over, with a driveless car those kind of things will never happen because of the state of the art sensors built in on the driveless cars.

in conclusion, driveless cars are safer, and better then manual driven cars. Driveless cars should be implemented as soon as possible to advance our society. The manual driven car has been around since the 1900's and it is time for it to go, just like black and white televisions.

F7E9EF1AC55A,"Driverless cars should not become a reality. My first reason why driverless cars should not become a reality is that they can malfunction and badly injure or possibly kill the people inside of the car. Driverless cars can run over an animal or human and possibly kill the living being in front of it. A couple tires can pop and swearve off the road into the a road beside it and injure not only the people inside but inncocent people in a car that didn't see what had happened.

For my second reason i think that they could get hacked and get send into the wrong direction. People can get lost and never find their way back to a safe place. Someone can hack the driverless car/s and end up killing the people inside or outside the car by controling the GPS and other important parts of the car.

For my third reason i believe smart cars possibly like driverless cars can or will get a virus and it will mess with the engine and everything that is important about the car. I know from experiance that a car with a t. v. can get a virius if it is not fixed properly. I believe a driverless car can or will get some or many viriuses if it is not check out properly when it is getting fixed.

To conclude my argument driverless cars can be a danger to nature and the people inside or surrounding the car. Driverless cars can get hacked and hurt people more than cars that need a driver all of the time. Driverless cars can get many viriuses and malfunction and destroy what is most important to the car.

I do think that driverless cars are good for people who do not know how to drive very good, and for people who do not want to drive. I don't want them because I like to drive, and I like cars.

I think driverless cars would be good for people who are bad drivers, because then those people would not be causing trouble on the road. Also people that are scared driving would be better for them so they wouldn't be nervous and could relax in the car.

The reason I do not want driverless cars though is that I want to drive, I don't want a computer to do it for me. I love cars to and its fun driving them, what would be the point of that dream sports car you always wanted if a computer was going to drive it for you. Also, computers are pretty smart but they dont know everything for instance, if a deer runs infont of you on a backroad would the car know that usually more deer come after that, or would it slam into the second deer, would it know the roads like you do.

So I am for them and against them. I think I would be better if they were optional so if you didn't want to drive you could buy one but if not you can still buy a normal car.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
76C8FE4FB3D8,"The aritcle "" Driverless Cars Are Coming "" talks about negative and positive asapects of driverless cars. I agree with the development of these cars because they help people out, they're smart cars, and people would be saving there money by not having to buy another car. All of these are good ideas to have driverless cars in the near future.

These new cars can be a big help to many people in genreal. If a person doesn't want to drive and is to lazy too, then that is what the cars are here for. Drivers can rest while the car is taking the wheel, but they would have to be in alert because there might be situatuons where there is work zones and would have to use our human skills to go around it. These cars can also warn drivers about certain things, such as pulling out of a driveway and making the driver look back and check if there are any cars.

These new and developed cars are also smart and can warn a driver with anything. Manufactures plan on using cameras to wtahc the driver have there eyes on the road and nowhere else. This would be a good idea because many people use there phone while driving. Either they are texting or talking to someone on the phone which is dangerous. This idea about using cameras to see if drivers are paying attention on the road would decrease the number of accidents and deaths. A good idea that they also came up with is to use flashing lights on the windshield to give the driver a heads up that it's there turn to take over the wheel which I feel is a good idea because if they're asleep then the flashing lights can wake them up instantly.

Another reason to get the driverless cars in the future is that a lot of people can't afford cars and they're stuck walking or riding there bike to school or to work. You won't have to buy a car anymore because of the new technology that they are coming up with. This will save people that are in need of a car a lot of money. This new technology would help out alot because of the different ideas that manufacutrers are coming up with.

I agree with the development of these cars because they help people out, they're smart cars, and people would be saving there money by not having to buy another car. These ideas would help and please a lot of people because it's so much help.           ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
87268A913967,"When the world was introduced to driverless cars, one thing came to my mind. Where is the fun in learning how to drive if you can't control what you drive? Yes I get that it could prevent traffic jams and take you the most fastest way to your destination according to traffic, but just because you are able to do what ever while the computer takes you to the place you are going, doesn't mean you can. According to traffic laws, the driver of a vehicle must be awake and alert to his/her surroundings. This is called defensive driving.

Where do I stand on this situation? I honestly can say that I am against driverless cars. I think this becasue, just because you are not driving doesn't mean you don't have to pay attention. According to the artile, BMW made a car that was somewhat driverless going 25 miles per hour. Then it finishes by saying that the steering wheel has presure sensitive fibers so it can make sure you still have ahold of the steering wheel at all time.

So in concluson, driverless cars are unsafe for now. Now I'm not saying that this will never happen, but for now, it is highly unlikely that something like this will become avalible in the near future. More materials might come out and make cars more safe than they already are, but it still won't protect us from computer driven cars. This is because computers are electronic, meaning they can be tampered with, hacked, and even shut down while in the middle of something. Also they can malfunction and take you to the wrong place or even drive you off a cliff or into water. So until then, all cars need an awake and alerted driver.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
DB27C7FB49D9,"As we look back through the records of histroy, humans have made and continue to make an extraorindary advancment in technology. These transformations in technology have worked and cooperated with humans to make life better. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" new advancements in self-driving cars are presented. Though there are many drawbacks of the idea as of right now, humans will make another historial breakthough as they always have. I believe the idea of driverless cars should be promoted due it being more safe, efficient, and helpful to our everyday lives.

The first reason of why I support driverless cars is because of how much more safer it is. If you look out to our world today, machines have replaced so much of what used to be the works of humans. That was because of machines being more capable of precision and safety. Many factory works have been transferred over to machines who do not have to rely on anyone else and additionally does not have to be concerned about safety. In the same way, we can see how much more safe driverless cars are. Google has proven this because their ""cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" In our world today, there are car accidents occuring every minute of our lives. If we can reduce the amount of accidents through driverless cars, then the lives of people will be more safe. Because of how driverless cars can ensure the safety of humans, I support it.

The second reason why I defend the idea of driverless cars is because of how dependent society can be towards these cars. Although driverless cars are not as developed as we wish to, they will be completed to perfection in the near future. With driverless cars being perfected by manufacturers, they will be more cooperative as they can coordinate themselves with other driverless cars so accidents will not happen, and they will find out the shortest distance and time to a certain destination. Google's cofounder Sergey Brin envisions of a more sophisticated car that enables more efficientcy than that of the human: ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" With the development of these cars, they can replace all the cars humans drive with a great transportation system for public-transport and commuters. I support driverless cars because of how they can steer the world into a better place.

Lastly, I endorse self-driving cars because of how helpful it will be to humans. If you were in in an emergency situation where you couldn't drive but needed to go to a hospital, driverless cars would literally save your life. Not only that, but if you are a child and you have no one that can drive you to your game, or grocery store, or friends house, you never have to ask anyone ever again for a ride. A driverless car would always be there to help you in your times of inconvenience. Because of how convenient driverless cars can be, it is one more step of why I defend driverless cars.

No matter how crazy an idea or an invention of technology may be, they were made to make the lives of humans better. Every invention had its own times of adversity: The lightbulb, computers, planes, and even the car itself. Every piece of technology had to go through numerous amounts of trial and error to become what it is today. This concept applies to driverless cars as well. We are merely in the stage of development and trial and error so that driverless cars can be made to perfection for the comfort of human lives. I support the idea of driverless cars because of how safe, efficient, and life-changing it will be to humans. ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Once more technology is perfected to cars, then something great can be created, driverless cars. These are dreamt about, the thought of them being furturistic is false. They are coming sooner than most know, and they will be a great invention. With lots of hard work driverless cars will help people in their everyday life, and prevent human error.

Having autonomous cars will make soicety a better functioning place. Once perfected, and these cars do not need any help of humans, this will greatly help everyone. So much time is wasted behind the wheel, people drive hours everyday.

If that time behind the wheel could be used to do something productive, then humans would be more efficent. Drivers might not be getting enough sleep due to the amount of work they have to do. If they have a long commute to work or school they can finish their work in the car. Humans would not have as much rage and would be less stressed. So, once humanless cars are perfected the life of the average human would become easier.

Human error behind the wheel is a major cause of death. People might not be thinking always and run a red light. Hit another car, and someone could die or sersiously be injured. A major problem today is driving under the influcence of alcohol or drugs. People can not always control their actions when impacted by these substances. This could harm themselves or others around them. With humanless cars these problems would disappear, if we have technonlogy taking control. Running red lights, or not using a turn signal, would no longer happen. People on the roads would be safer and less likely to die or be harmed.

F00DE298EB90,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars, and even though he had really good and valid reasonings for the positives, I still wouldn't think that driverless cars would be a good idea. Why, because anything could happen when a car is just being completely controlled by technology. Anything can have malfunctions, wether it's proved to have them or not.

For example, in the 7th paragraph, it states: ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" Meaning you would still have to have a human taking percautions at all times. Another thing I don't like, is how the cars alert the driver when it comes to traffic complications, because in paragraph 7 it also states: ""They can't navigate their way out of traffic jams, roadworks or accidents."" What if the car goes into a freak out mode and ends up having a mind of its own, because it won't know what to do, and starts driving automatically? Also, what if you get into a horrible car accident injuring yourself and many other people? Who would be put to blame here if the car is completely driverless?

These problems and questions I have with the ""driverless cars"" need to be taken very seriously into consideration.

D683936389D5,"If we start having driverless cars, then there are many pros and cons.

Driving cars that we currently have already have many positive and negatives.

In my opinion, driverless cars seem easier to work with almost like they would be safer because of all the improvements that a regular car doesn't have.

As the article mentions, the driverless cars would ""need a whole lot of sensors, on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver and an inertial motion senser.

That being stated the driverless cars have a lot more look out than regular cars do.

Because, the driverless cars have more lookout than regular cars do, they would be more aware of what was going on, where the car was, how close it was to an object and better your safety.

Many cars that aren't driverless have a back sensor for when they are backing up, and will beep if the car gets to close to an object and that alone helps people out a lot so driverless cars that have sensors all around could help people out a ton by making them more aware of their surroundings.

""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" states that they would ""have a better response than a human driver can do alone.""

The car would have a better responce because ""furhter improvements in sensors and compter hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more driving tasks on their own.""

By the article saying that, driverlss cars would be a huge help out to many people.

You wouldn't have to worry about getting lost or not knowing where to go because the car would know for you.

Also, with driverless cars they allow breaks to stop when needed so if you were in a sitution where you needed to use the breaks you for sure would be able too.

All of the ""driverless"" cars now arent fully driverless.

""They can steer, accelerate and break themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.""

That being said, the driverless cars that we have now are already smart enough to do their own thing but yet warning us when it comes down to needing human attention.

In driverless cars ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over whenever required... the car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over by vibrating the seat, flashing lights on the windshield, and other heads up display.""

There are many ways to get ahold of a driveer if needed to with th cars already, so hen they remake them into newer and greater cars... the cars should almost be smarter than us.

Would you rather have a car that drives itself?

Or would you want to have all control?

I think they are a good idea because they can be very helpful to people that have a certain type of disabilty. They help with the camera when you are backing out and have a sensor if you are getting close to something. Like in the BMW it has many different funtions in it. It alerts the human driver when a situation occurs and when there is an accident or work zones ahead. Thats when the driver has to take control of the vehicle. The car also has flashing lights on the windshield and other heads up displays.

Even though many people like it, the question is if there was an accident who's fault would it be. I think it would be the car manufacturer's fault because they were made to be able to do all that stuff with all the technology in it. Even though everything has a problem with it, if it is a driverless car I think they should make sure it has zero problems with it before they let them go out for people to buy them. It cannot be the drivers fault because they are not driving it they are just sitting in the seat and are sipposed to be trusting the car.

1D378A2F64BD,"Autonomous cars are not the thing of the future. At this point in time, our technology can not match real life situations. There are too many conditions and too many saftey standards that are virtually impossible to accomplish while creating a ""Driverless Car"".

In the subtitle; Sensing the World, it explains how most of the driverless cars act and how they truely work. Many of the first productions were meant to run a specific track rigged with wires, magnets, and etc. This technology would be far too expensive, so we must rely on sensors and other features connected directly to the car. The problem with sensors, video cameras, and laser systems, is that they all can malfunction. The last thing anyone wants to do is to rely on something may indeed malfunction and put them in danger. Even if we were to say that the sensors and other technology was working in top shape, there still are limits to them such as poor lighting, bad weather conditions, and even animals.

Overall, we as human should not rely on technology to perform one of the worlds dangerous daily functions. Instead of progressing AI control, we should focus more on how the car would react if we the humans lost control. We have come this far by manual control, why switch now? Most accidents that occur on the road are drunk driving, distraction, and un safe conditions. Built in technology would be able to counter both driving under the influence and distractions.

09F7F5FAB692,"Is there a future for driverless cars? Well certainly there is lots of companies that have been getting into the buisness of driverless cars. Driverless cars are cars that need little to mininum human help. There are a tons of problems with them to this day. Some people show interest in the negative side, or against driverless cars, but others are for the driverless cars.

My view is that driverless cars are a waste of time and energy. Tons of people enjoy the ride of having control behind the wheel. Also, both cars pollute about the same. Most driverless cars are gas, electric, or both. When you look at a chart you will see that the pollution from coal and gasoline are about the same.(Only for cars) When you plug in your driverless car you are using a natural resource called coal. Coal is burned in electrical plants to produce electricity.

The other side of argument is that driverless cars are a good thing. According to paragraph one "",The car he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" That sentence shows that the people that are for driverless cars see change in fuel usage. The people for this car also say that the car has human like driving skills. There also claims of this car being driverless. They also claim that some people get bored behind the wheel of a older car.

There are tons of problems with the other side of this argument. One of the problems is that they see car using less fuel than today's taxis. When in reality they are using abolute the same in coal usage. Other claim that they have stated is that the car is driverless. How can it be driverless if it still needs help through harsh traffic and consruction sites. They also claim that it saves money, but in the end the car will cost a forturne.

This arguement has become one of the hottest topics of the decade. There are people that are for driverless cars. There are also people that are agianst driverless car.

I my self personally like the fact that the driver does not have to drive the car all the time. I think it would be a good idea for handicapped people.

I do not think it is a good idea for many reasons. It states in the article that the cars are eqqipted with a gps, but what if there is a current construction or hazard in the route it takes you? How will the car beable to pass another car on a two lane highway? How about drunk drivers? If a drunk wants to get in a car and drive, that car would allow it, but whenever it is time for the driver to take over, 99.9% of the time that will not happen.

I think there will always be manuel driven cars and trucks around. If someine needs to tow something a driverless car would not be able to tow anything. Farmers, personal buissness' and many other people would have a big issue with this.

Although the world is nearly going to all electronics, mechanics will have to go back to school to learn about these new cars. Most manuel driven cars never have peoblems on the road, because everything is mechanical. Switching everything over to an electronic sensor will mess everyone up. If a laser goes out for surroundings around the car, the driver cannot do anything to help it.

53DBEDF116C7,"The concept of driverless cars has been a rather popular idea for decades now. However this concept seems to be getting further from being a concept and closer to becoming a reality in the past decade due to companies such as Google taking the wheel on research. However, as with anything shiny and new like a brand new car, there has to be some sort of counter agrument against it. Why do we need it? Will we be able to afford it? Will it run over the dog trying to back out of the driveway? These are only a few arguments that can be made against this new type of vehicle.

One of the biggest arguments that can be made against driverless cars would be the overall safety they present. With the cars, they would (obviously) be able to drive themselves. How would they be able to drive on the unpredicatable roads? Would they know to stop for the skunk in the road or the toddler running across the street? Would they know exactly when to brake so they don't ram into the car in front of them? There are so many driving hazards that could come that we aren't exactly sure where to start. After all, no matter how well the cars are put together and how much research goes into making them work as well as possible, even the best technology still has it's bad days.

What would the driver's job in this be? To look pretty until the car reaches it's destination? If the car where to need assistance of the driver,would the driver be able to take back control without a moment's notice?

Most every kind of technology uses some sort of software to keep it functioning, and with that software come necessary maintenence and updates. How would the software keeping the car functioning work? Would you buy the car and have to hope and pray that driving laws and regulations don't change from the time you buy the car to the time it's time to buy a new one? Would you be able to connect your car to your home internet and it update itself once it's not being used? If that's the case, what would happen if the update where to disagree with your care and then the car would perform poorly upon the next usage?

These are only a few of the arguments that I can make at the present time without more information on these cars. Yes, I realize that most of these arguments are hypothetical, but that usually tends to be the case when it comes to technology that doesn't yet have much coverage to the people. If we were to get closer to the reality of driverless cars being commonplace among the public, then I'm sure we could come up with more solid arguments. However, until that day, we'll just have to sit tight and wait for our questionable autoobile future. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
8D5DC914F9F3,"Driverless cars should not be used on open roads due to the extreamly dangerous potental the driverless car has. If you were to get in a car accident who would be to blame ? The car or the driver ? The computer of the car could have so many errors that could potentally injure another human on the roads.

The dangerous potental the car has is, it can accelerate on its own. Imagine you're going down 267 here in Plainfield. You're in a driverless car and the car begins to accelerate, however it doesnt meet a constant speed. As the car continues to go faster and faster, its to late to stop because you already rearended the car infront of you. Causing the person in the car infront of you to spin out of controll and hit a telephone pole. Because of a computer error in the car an inicent bystander's life has been taken. That there just shows the potental danger the driverless car has just due to the ""auto acceleration"" programing in the car.

In that car crash you have to give the poliece your insurance redgerstration ext. When you file the insurance claim whos fault it the accident? Yourself or the car manufacturers? You could try to blame the manufacture however you're probably not going to get to far. It's not their fault the computer of the car had a glitch. There is nothing they can do about it. So now you could potentally be charged with wreckless driving and vehicular manslotter, even though you didn't intentually kill the person. Your insurance is most likely going to say it was your fault for not having controll of the car. Who is to say it was infact the car and not your fault? That's just the problem exactaly .

Technology fails everyday so why put it in a car and put human lives at risk? Using the heads-up system is a good idea however it could also fail resulting in the faitality of another human. Using the heads-up system could get the attention of the driver to let them know that they need to take over. What happens when the driver doesnt take over and the car continues to have a mind of it's own. Again possiable resulting in an accident and a possiable faitality.

Admitting that technology is a great advantage and is used everywhere today. The point is greater technology than what we have now should stay off the roads. Keeping technology off the roads can save lives and prevent accidents waiting to happen. The danger of auto accelaration, heads-up system, and not knowing whos fault the accident was your's or the car's, is absalutely not worth the life of a human.

BMW has made cars with special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel the whole time. This part of the technology will help a lot out with those reckless drivers. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Also the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

The point that the article is making is that should we have cars that can drive themselfes, in my opinoin i would say no because it would cause so much disstortion and everthing would be in a heave of trouble. What we would be doing is we would be taking away jobs for people that live off of driving people places, or we would be spending so much money trying to make these cars, and also what would happen when the went out of control and no one could stop them then what would we do.

The idea of people losing jobs dosent sound right for me because i know how frustrating it is to lose many jobs and it isn´t easy. And something else what would stop those people who are mad and ticked at the idea that they just lost their jobs to a bunch of robots, that wont go so well because they will probably start rioting in the streets and that will just cause more of a problem´s for everone.

And also you would have to conceder on how much money they would have to spend to keep making those types of cars, it will probably cost millions of dollars for just one state. So they would be spending more money on making the cars than they would be getting so it seems that it would be a waste of time on what this idea has in store.

What other problems would happen if something went wrong with these cars like to say if someone missed up with the programming it could cause a lot of problems across the united states because so many car crashes would be happening, and that would bring so much panic through out the nation. so that is another reason why not to.

So what is the article stating is if we should have cars that control themselfs. there is to many if´s for me to say that we should like i can see that there are good parts to this like to say that we wouldn´t spend so much many on gas and it would be safer for the most part.

BC32404D0719,"I would have to say that I am in favor of moving forward and progressing towards driverless cars. There are quite a few reasons why I believe it's a great idea. After the idea is perfected, roads will be much safer, The cost of transportation will go down and also it could possibly make transporting on roads much faster.

The idea of this ""driverless car"" is quite astonishing, but once it is perfected it will open up doors to new oppurtunities in transporting on roads. For example, the car would be able to sense cars that a human could possibly not see. This would make the amount of car accidents go down.

Also, some states have already allowed computer driven cars on the road, as it says in the passage. This demonstates that these driverless cars are becoming safer everyday. It also says in the article that manufacturers believe the number of states to allow driverless cars is only going to continue rising as they advance there search for safer and possibly cheaper cars or solutions.

One other reason that i believe that these cars are a great idea is because it says that the cars can make for cheaper transportation. For example, it states in the article that Sergey Brin, cofounder of google, believes that the fuel amount needed in these futuristic cars will be half of what we use today. We would be able to do less harm to the environment by using less fuel. Also, Sergey Brin states that taxis would be more flexible and safe. This reduces the risk of having a taxi driver that might put you in danger. Although these cars will be much safer there are many more reasons to agree with driverless cars.

One final reason I believe in driverless cars itll be much faster to get from place to place. For example, a autonomous car could go a certain speed much higher than the current highway speed limits and sense any danger. It would be able to go at a much faster speed but also keep the roads jusr as safe.

All in all, there is still much research to be done for these cars to be perfected and be able to be driven on the roads legally. Although, if we continue to advance in driveless cars the generations after us will be see roads much different then we do today. They will see a much safer, faster, and cheaper way of moving around.

B6C28D93DD33,"Would driverless cars really be helpful to people if they were successfully made? They would probably turn out to be something great if manufacturers succeeded in making these cars. Cars like these sound just as good as flying cars in the future. However, driverless cars do not seem to be a good thing for society. There could be a few problems if this type of car was created and here are some of those problems.

Driverless cars are not good for the society if they are made. Firstly, people would be more lazy than they already are if introduced to this. We already have sensors to help us with driving, so what more do we need. People are already lazy enough today because of technology. This idea would not help society at all if it were introduced to us.

Secondly, in paragraph nine, they state that if one were to be in a car accident, on one will really know who is at fault. In addition to that, people could lie, saying that it was the car's fault, thus people would blame the manufacturers. There could be a lot companies sued because of car accidents and of people who do not want to tell the truth. Also, what happens when a driverless car hits a pedestrian? Driverless could do a lot of bad things and it would all fall on top of the company.

Lastly, there is truly no point in making driverless cars because the driver is not doing a lot in the first place. People know how to drive already and there is no point in making a car that does everything that the driver can already do. This goes back to the laziness part. People also know that there's no point, but yet they decide we should have it because of their laziness. These are some reasons on why driverless cars are not good for society.

Driverless are not a good idea and should not be introduced to society. Honestly, it would step up our game with technology, but we should not waste with something like a driverless car. We can do so much more with this kind technology and should not take it for granted. We should be using our brains for thinking of a way to stop global warming or even the flying car idea sounds nice. To cnoclude, creating driverless cars is not a good idea.

When these cars come, they will have the ability to change the world positively.

There are many positive aspects when it comes down to these driverless cars. Firstly, they will provide huge and new advancements in technology. With that being said, there has already been a model of what these cars will have. According to paragraph four, a model car consists of ""... a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera... four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" These advancement will contribut to safer driving. With technology evolving comes better safety and less aqccidents are likely to occur. For example, drunk driving has been a huge cause of deaths. Smarter cars will essentially lessen promblems like that. Also, with more developed sensors, it is palpable that accidents are not prone to happen. These cars are super efficient for people too. The text states, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus."" This will save people time and money. The car advancement is essential.

Some people may argue that these cars bring a negative aspect. They worry that these cars' technolgies could fail and they only feel secure when the car is driven with a human driver in control at all times. They also reason that sensors are nothing new. As a result of people claiming that these cars are unsafe, it has been illegal in most states to even test theses cars. They do not feel comfortable being in a vehicle that drives itself.

These advance cars are surely safe. Others argue that the cars are unsafe and does not allow testing the car; however, how would they know whether the car is safe or not if they have never used it before? The technolgies need to be tested and improved for these cars to be self-driven. According to paragraph five, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more driving tasks on their own."" Sensors have become more advance to detect and respond so that the cars are safer. For those who argue that they do not feel safe without a human driver in control, the cars are not completely driverless.

Even, after reading the passage, I don't believe that driverless cars should be a reality right now.

Maybe in a few years, when changes are made for safety precautions, but in the now, we can handle driving on our own.

Having the ""smart roads"" equipped with electrical cable or magnets, as General Motors and Berkeley engineers did in paragraph 3, would never work with rebuilding all new roads all over the world just for these cars.

Imagine the time and money spent just for these roads to be built.

And what will happen once the passengers are on a road without these ""smart"" adaptions?

Because of this, the next version of this driverless car is to rather equip the car with sensors and not the road itself as the Toyata Prius did in paragraph 4.

But no matter how many sensors, lasers, or recievers you have on this driverless car, artificial intelligence will never be as smart as human intelligence.

What will happen when a deer jumps out from a field, a pedestrian rides his bike, a child's ball bounces out from her yard, or a pothole comes near comes bouncing from her yard? Will the sensors and lasers notice the change and react as fast a human would?

Even if there is still a driver in the seat, as said in paragraph 8, what will keep their attention on the road and not fixated on their phone or other passengers?

No amount of buzzing or flashing lights will get the attention of the driver to whatever accident may occur quick enough to make a change.

If anything, the displays will make the driver panic in such a way that will make their safety decline further.

Driverless cars are especially targeted to keep those who would normally drive while under the influence of alchohol and others safe from them.

But once again, what if something should come between the car and where the car wants to go?

The ""driver"" under the influence of alchohol cannot to anything otherwise, especially with the displays distracting the driver further.

Without these driverless cars those under the influence would normally grab a taxi or ride home with a friend, but with the driverless cars, he/she would be a potential threat.

In conclusion, having driverless cars in the world would not be nearly as safe as human intelligence.

Driverless cars can sometimes be a danger to people. If the car was completly driverless then it wouldn't need human skills. A driverless car shouldn't be able to use human skill. It should be able to do everything when needed to. The driver must remain alert when in a driverless car. They must keep their hands near the steering wheeling at all times to be ready to take control.

Drivers would get bored just sitting around waiting for the car to alert them. Why would anyone want to buy a driverless car isn't in full control? People shouldn't make driverless cars becasue it could probably hurt someone. What happens if the technology fails? Whose fault would it be if it does fail? In case of an accident, there should be laws. Where would they sell these cars.

If the technology ever fails I feel like it would be the drivers fault. It would be their fault simply because they were so eager to try out the driverless car. They thought it would be so perfect to try it out. But then it would the inventor's fault because they were the ones that invented it.

Driving teaches people to be responsible, without this how will we instill responsiblity into the people on our roads?

In todays society new technologies come out everyday. However, we know how frusterating technology can be if it doesn't work. If our Iphone or laptop glitches it usually isn't a big deal. It can be fixed in an instant, maybe even by yourself. But what could the consequences be if a driverless car glitches? While you are driving you don't really have a minute to google how to fix your car like you can do with an Ipad. Just like any new technology a driverless car could have malfunctions, but these malfunctions could but peoples lifes at risks. People may say that even today with people driving cars that there can be glitches in cars. However, since real people are driving the cars they can evaluate the situation and control the car.

If the driverless car does fail whose fault is it? The ""driver"" or the manufacturer? This question will definetly come up if driverless cars come into our society. If you get in a crash, but weren't in control of the car, how can you be blamed? This problem could to lead to new laws, many court cases, and law suits.

Driving is a right of passage for teens today. Driverless cars, while could make life easier, would just bring more problems and arguments into our already technology filled lives. Driverless cars should not be legal because driving teaches responsibilty, the technology could fail, and cause arguments over liability.        ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

They still need human control in certan situations like in passage 7 stating some accidents and work zones human interaction with the mobile vehicle is needed. In a way its much sophicated than human driving more precise as you will. In this case it would be alot more safer for us and the enviorment as they say in passage 1 saying that the cars would use half the gas we use today. Theres more pros than cons in this invention and it would be a great accomplishment to creat a car with these abilities.

Google cars are here not yet purchasable , but they are made and tested.

With this long period of time they should create the best saftey precautions in the vehicle itself. With these new features im sure that they would bring in high saftey precaution in these vehicles because this is a new era of mobile vehicles. The fact there would be less accidents and fewer human fault accidents. There would be less tickets and fewer police officers running around pulling people over. If they make this car how i am thinking they will they could change everything about the art of driving.

Less gas more money thats what we all want. More money thats what youll have after Google release these driverless cars. The bonus will be a healthier enviorment. Half the gas half the polution. The enviorment is severly important to us. The air we breath, the food we eat, the pure decorations, the way we live is based on this huge factor of the enviorment the more healthier it is the better we live. With this car great things will happen outside and inside our wallets.

Based on these facts in the article theres a definate change becoming afloat the way we live will change for a long time. We get alot of improvements when they release this driverless car the rules will change for the better. We will see our family members safer with these automibles on the market.

D31E73F6C4F5,"In America,people get into crashes everyday, some fatal or some with minimal damage. Some crashes are caused by people's own stupidity, reckless driving, or distractions like using their phone or staring at something outside. People should use driverless cars because there will be less accidents, more safety, and people can go wherever they want without the distractons of a GPS or map.

In the new driverless car it is said that a 3-D laser will be constantly updating the car's surroundings and that it can mimic the skill of a human being. Most accidents are from drunk driving so if a person is intoxicated and must take the car home they can use the car without having to actually drive and more people will be safe. It is also said that sensors can detect and respond to the dangers of skidding or rolling over because of the computer hardware and aoftware so if anyone is close to an accident, they won't have to worry because of the sensors. Lastley, when people use a GPS or a map it can either break down and have a glitch or just get in the way of driving. With the new car all people do is put the address in once and off they go to their destination without having to worry about what will happen if it breaks down.

In conclusion, people should have driverless cars because there will be less accident, more safety, and not having to worry about a GPS or a map. Future technology is coming and there will be a better future so more lives will be spared from the manual use of a human behind a wheel. Parents will feel more safe about their children in the street and not having to think about what's going on with the driver.

D173DB242755,"Are driverless cars really what our world needs? In my personal opinion i don't think we should waste our money on driverless cars. There are many reasons that this is not a safe idea and it should not take place. Do you want a ""robot"" having your life in its hands?

The type of driverless cars that have been put to test will end up costing us alot of money that we don't have to waste. Also technology has failed us numeroumous of times and putting our life in its hands is not such a good idea. No matter how much money we spend on this technology to keep us safe there is a possibilty it will fail us. Just like if you were to go buy the new iphone, peopl e say it is the best working phone on the market but they tend to break on you, burn out, and all these other things no matter how new it is. If you can't trust a phone with such little duties why would you want a computer operated car doing so? These driverlesss cars still need humans to be fully active and responsive. If this is the case then humans should just continue driving themselves. I understand that some peopl ebelive this will reduce the number of accidents that happen but a computer is just as obligated to make mistakes just like humans and maybe more. Sometimes computers do this thing where thye juist shut down on you no warnings or anything and what if this was to happen on a highway with this new driverless cars people are wanting to invent? There is no way to really hold anyone responsible for an accident in such manner. The driver has little control over what happens and the manufacturers will not want to take responsibilty because they want to keep their money in their pockets. I feel as if we could be spending our time on better and more important things. My question is why fix something that isn't broken?

In my honest opinion driverless cars are not needed and are trully a waste of our well hard worked for money. There are other things int hie world right now that could use the time and money we are going to waste on such project. The cars we have now are getting the job we need done. If people don't want to drive that is why we have busses, taxis, ubers, and trains for. Getting driverless cars will put people out of a job because companies wouldn't have to pay a car to do its job and this will put more people on our streets. To be honest it might even casue more problems is other areas like murder, robbery, and ect. We have to take a look at all aspects of this decision we are making as a nation. Look at it as if it was you loosing a job or put yourself in a situation where you driverless car causes you or a loved one a life beacuse computers are not as reliable as people may belive. Driverless cars are a bad idea and we should think long term about devloping these cars and puting them on our roads.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F83714238F21,"I think that driverless cars is something that can potentially make driving a little more safe. Driverless cars are not completely driverless though because they alert the driver when they are needed to take over. Sensors used in cars are also beneficial because they can give information that can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine. Therefore, it allows for a better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

Even though driverless cars can do some things on their own, the human driver must still remain alert and be ready to take over when necessary. For this reason, it is necessary for the car to be ready to notify the driver when a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, and the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These are both ways that can alert a driver when it is time for them to drive, which can help people to be ready to focus while driving.

In conclusion, driverless cars can be beneficial to us and help drivers while they are driving. The drivers of these cars must also be alert as well too. There are sensors and other developments that can help with this process and notify drivers when it is time for them to take control. Everything will not happen right away because it is a process that will take time to be sought through and manufactured correctly. So in the future, maybe we will see more driverless cars then than now and it will be a beneficial way to the driving in our country.   ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
438D2F70E555,"Cars that can drive themselves is a type of technology that is coming. I believe it is a positive advancement. Many big name companies have been working on this advancement for a few years and in a couple more years these companies plan to have cars that can drive themselves on the raod. Having cars that can drive themselves can improve road safety and save lives.

Driverless cars can improve our lives and also make our lives safer. These cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. They have sensors that makes sure the driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The also can prevent the driver from using a cell phone by a camera located inside the car to make sure the driver is aware. Driverless cars can prevent things like wreckless driving and speeding. Another thing these cars could prevent is drunk driving. The driver could return home safely even if they are drunk without having to put their life or someone else's life in danger. Driverless cars can also make driving fun. Manufacturers want to have in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. To make these cars even safer the displays can be turned off instantly to allow the driver to take over when they need to. Although these cars can drive mostly on their own the driver still needs to be aware just in case they have to take over. For example, the cars are designed to notify the driver to navigate through certain situations like going around an accident or through a work zone. The sensors that are put in these diverless cars can also improve safety. These sensors can respond to out of control skids or rollovers. These sensors can also cause the car to apply breaks on certain wheels and reduce engine power. The sensors have a far better response and control than a human driver does. These cars are a few short years from becoming fully driverless. These companies just need a few more years to make improvements on the sensors and computer hardware. These improvements will make the cars handle more driving tasks without the help of humans.

Driverless cars are coming and coming quickly although some may not like the idea of driverless cars i think it can be a useful technology. Automakers are making more and more improvements on driverless cars. Tesla has already released a car capable of driving 90 percent of the time on autopilot. As automakers improve the cars and work through problems with the law you will see more and more of driverless cars on the road. As long as automakers keep striving for improvement the more these cars will be fully driverless. Automakers are coming down the home stretch and will have 100 percent driverless cars on the road.

I am also uncomfortable with the car having cameras everywhere including inside of it. It might make the driver feel strange knowing that they are being watched and the car is invading their privacy. Another reason why I do not like it is hackers could hack the system and cause someone to crash into something and cause the passengers to get seriously injured. Also their could be a time where the car malfuntions and crashes. I think that if this driverless car idea does not work out he way that Google planned it to be then they would lose lots of money.

9447D5C6EA03,"The development of a new, self-driving car that functions efficiently is being tested by various different companies, like Google and General Motors, but what practical purpose would this development solve? Some argue that these smart cars would increase traffic efficiency and could facilitate a new age of safe motor vehicles. Others argue that we cannot place our trust regarding safety solely in a machine. The creation of driverless cars should not be further developed, despite potential increase in safety, due to the increased dependency on technology it would facilitate, as well as liability issues regarding crashes or other potential accidents, both of which could negatively impact other aspects of the future.

Despite the issues of liability and dependency on technology, the development of new cars could potentially reduce safety risks associated with full human control over vehicles. Because ""the information from the sensors [of the driverless cars] can cause the car to apply brakes... allow a far better response and control than a human could manage,"" driverless cars may reduce potential for crashes of other incidents. Advanced sensor technology is indeed an asset to this new development, however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged. The problem is that most people would nate place full trust in technology, thus eliminating the purpose of a ""driverless car"" being completely driverless. Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars.

Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road. As of right now, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This means that someone must always be in the driver seat to ensure safety when the situation requires them to take over. This, however, contradicts the purpose of the ""driverless car."" In addition, because the point of these cars is to drive safely without human control, people could have this in mind while in a driverless car. As a result they may give little regard to the road, and rely on the car to keep them safe and get them to their destination. Then, if they are not prepared for an alert or a need for human assistance, because they expected the car to handle it, their dependency on the car put their safety at risk.

The liability issues if such an accident were to occur could be tremendous. If there was an accident, the question would arise, "" who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This could lead to court trials and lawsuits that would either harm the consumers in the auto industry, or the producers. Either way, the costs would have an increasingly negative impact on the economy. It would not be logical to assume that these cars would be one hundred percent safe, as there is alway room for error, and ""presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver..."" Because many people refuse to place full trust in technology that could have potential flaws, if an accident were to occur, the industry of self-driving cars would likely crash, as people would more and more see this technology as danger, and place the blame on the auto industry.

If further developments were to be made so that these cars truly don't need a driver, while it may reduce safety risks, ultimately the costs regarding user dependency and liability would outweigh benefits. Increased dependency could actually create more safetly problems, and liability issues could result is a crash of the auto industry's smart technology branch. If the concept of this Driverless car were changed to, rather than have no driver, help the driver, then the outcome may be more beneficial. If people still drove the car, but with helpful alerts, warnings, or displays, traffic safety would go up, and the liability and dependency issues would be lessened or dissolved altogether. A new age of technological innovation is here, and utilizing this idea in this moderate waycould pave the road to a brighter future.",6,Driverless cars,Text dependent
ABF073BD87DD,"Have you ever thought of having a car that could drive itself? It would be a pretty cool car to have but there are some things you have to think about when you consider on buying a car. Of course the car is going to be expansive but what car isnt? There are alot more negative things you have to think about when buying a smart car. Negative aspects of a driveless are is that they are expensive, need many sensors, and they result in many accidents.

A driveless car is very expansive because they have to know the roads, when to stop, how to stop, or when to go. It stated "" These smart-road-systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Driveless cars work well but they are too expensive because they have to know the upgrades of roads. Imagine the cost you have to pay for the car, giving them their money back for the money they spent and work they spent putting into the car. Sensors are a very big issues too in driveless cars.

Driveless cars require many sensors in order for the car to work and drive on its own. It seems cool but what will happen when one of those sensors stopped working and you didnt know? The sensors were placed every where in the car so therefore it can work properly. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor..."" There is a lot of sensors installed inside the car but something can go very wrong if one of them stop working and the car crashes and injure somebody.

Who fault would it be if someone is injured because of techonlogy failure ? Driveless car are not reliable due to safety concerns. ""Manucatures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe... If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" If someone is hurt because the technology of the car, you really can't say who to blame. Although the driver can take control of the car at any time so therfore the driver can be at fault because the driver wasn't paying attention to the road. The driveless car is supposed to make the driver aware of danger but it couldn't have if there was an accident so the car can be at fault to. No one really Knows who to blame because both the car and the driver took responsible of the accident and they both could have prevented the accident from happening. If the car would have alerted the driver, the driver could have took control BUT if the driver eas paying attention, he could have once again took control.

There are positive and negative aspects when it comes to driveless cars but of course no one pays attention to the negative. When thinking about purchasing a driveless car you have to think about the cost and your safety concerns.

77A3CA0EFA23,"Driverless cars are a very intriguing and thought provoking concept that manufacturers and society have toyed with for decades. The possibility of reducing the risk of human error is very tempting and a reason for why many people are in supports of having driverless cars. Although, not everyone shares the same opinion regarding cars that don't require human control. I do not think that completely driverless cars are the best way to go because of the high risk of a computer error, but minimal human interaction could possibly be very beneficial.

Many companies such as BMW and Google have been working on developing driverless cars. While these cars have had some success on the road, there are some situations where a human driver is needed to take control of the situation. One example of this is a construction zone. Cars can have a radar and know how the road twists and turns, but in construction zones that is all thrown out the window. There are usually new boundaries created by traffic cones that the sensors on the car might not be able to connect.

Even though I am opposed to cars that are completely driverless, I do think that the integration of this technology can be highly beneficial in some areas of driving. One place that I feel like computer-assisted driving can help is when a person is backing up. Often times it is hard to see everything and it can be very easy to hit something or someone while reversing in a car. A computer that generates three dimensional images of the car's surroundings, such as the LIDAR system used by Google, could assist drivers by helping them see things that they previously weren't able to see. I also think that an automatic brake that is activated when the car is dangerously close to an object would be beneficial as well.

While there are risks and rewards to a driverless car, I feel like the risk of a computer error is a great one that could cost money and lives. Driver assistance, including cameras for backing up and an automatic brake to help prevent wrecks, is something that I would be open to in the future. We could soon be seeing these driverless cars on the road as many companies plan to have models out in the next five or six years, but I doubt they will be completely driverless.

In 2013, the Toyota Prius had sensors, a video camera, GPS reciver, and a intertial motion sensor. All of this combined is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

I don't think that we should have driverless cars, because taxi companies would loose all their emploies, it would save the company money but, also what about that families? How are they going to get their next meal on the table without a job? Driverless cares would leave people hungry and jobless, then their kids would be taken by DCS and them the ' family ' would be seperated.

Also, driverless cars could cause many wrecks by not having exact measurment of when to stop. And much of the driving laws include a person to be driving. How would the car get it's licentce ? Would it have a liceence? When driving you use your brain a car doesnt have a brain aso it wouldn't work out for them.

Though they have gone more than half a million miles without a crash, there are cons to these typs of cars. They arn't entirely driverless yet. These cars still need help getting through places like work zones and accidents. These cars are expensive and still need human help, but they do come with a special safety feature that normal cars don't have.

Driverless cars can be helpful, but they are still expensive. The roads would more than likely have to be updated. General Motors and engineers from Berkeley have both tried different ways to improve the roads. This included roads embedded with electrical cables or magnets, sending signals to the car. These methods proved to be unreasonably expensive. Engineers then looked at making smarter cars. To make them smart enough to drive safely without the help of people and smart roads they would need many sensors. They would need at least nine different sensors. Putting that many sensors on enough cars for everyone to drive would be very costly.

People could also benefit from these cars if they truly were driverless. These so called ""driverless"" cars can't do many things a person can do while driving. For instance, these cars can't pull in or out of driveways. They also can't make it through roadwork or accidents. Currently, the fastest that driverless cars can handle is 25 miles per hour. This would definitly not be safe on a highway or interstate. These cars are ment to take people where they need to go, but the driver must remain focus if they need to take the wheel.

There are pros to cars like these though. There has to be something to keep the ""driver"" interested while waiting for their turn to drive, so some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. If there is something that keeps the driver entertained, there has to be something to get them alert again. These entertainment features can be turned off when needed, pulling the drivers attention back to the road. These safety percautions arn't currently in cars for texting and driving.

Most people buy a vehicle so they can be in control of where they are going, how fast they're going, etc. Personally i would not prefer a machine taking me places all day. Driverless vehicles may have a technical difficulty which could result in an injury, or worst case scenario, a fatality. Not only is it endangering the operator and surrounding individuals, but also the manufacturer due to reliabilty regulations.

In reality, driverless cars is a cool topic to think about, but are they completely independent? The answer to that is no, well at least for now. Driverless vehicles use a bunch of different sensors, lasers and computers to figure out which way is which and to understand their surroundings. Although the programming of these smart cars remain quite complex, they still lack the ability to handle situations such as backing out of a drive way, going through construction zones, and what to do if there is an accident ahead. You might be thinking ""So what happens if the vehicle doesnt know what to do?"" If a smart vehicle doesnt know what to do in a situation, it allows you to take over, thus making driverless vehicles not completely driverless. Don't worry though, the vehicle alerts you in multiple ways if there is an issue in which you need to take into consideration, such as blinking lights on the wind shield, the drivers seat vibrates and talking to you through the speakers. The vehicle only pays attention if you pay attention, they have sensors in the steering wheel to make sure you have your hands on the wheel at all times, and a camera above watches you to make sure you keep your eyes on the road.

The driverless vehicle can also be very dangerous. Almost one hundred percent of the time, machines/computers have some sort of mishap or technical difficulty quite often. Some may be worse than others but most of the time they always malfunction. So why would you want a possible death bound machine taking you to your everyday day errands? Supposedly that is a risk people are willing to take. They should sop with the production completely and stick with the modern day transportaion.

Having a smart vehicle drive you around all day without having to invest any effort at all would be heaven, but it is just not possible right now. Some time or another the operator will always have to take over because smart cars are unfortunately not smart enough. driverless vehicle is false advertisement. They should be titled ""Assisted smart vehicle"" or something of that sort. If they are going to continue manufacturing these vehicles then they should at least keep them off of the market until they have worked out all of the flaws.

Driverless vehicles are a good idea, but remain a complete disgrace to the world of transportation. Some people actually enojoy driving, and these machines dont allow you to do that.

However, in heavy traffic or contruction scenarios the driver may still need to take over. This is a good thing the car can alert the driver, but much more work needs to be put in to how these cars will operate in non-ideal conditions such as construction, traffic jams, and weather. Can these driverless vehicles accomplish such a thing? Yes, they can. Perhaps sooner than anyone anticipated. Considering it's been over half a million miles without a collision, I'd say these cars have a bright future.

As of 2013 BMW announced a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" feature was in development. This feature will allow the car to make its way through tough spots in heavy traffic situations at speeds up to 25 miles an hour. This is a milestone in the race towards a truly independent driverless vehicle. Currently the driver is still required to keep his/her hands on the wheel in these scenarios to be prepared for the worst. However, this will not be the case for long. At the rate driverless cars are progressing, a fully pledged driverless vehicle will be a reality soon enough.

New laws will have to be put in place to deal with the legal aspect of these vehicles. Different situations will need to call for different charges and outcomes to determine whos fault it was. If the driverless vehicle warned the driver to take control, and said driver didn't, then the blame should fall to the driver. If the vehicle runs a stoplight, and the vehicle did not send any alert to the test driver, then blame should fall towards the company.

The future is closer than most realize. Tesla has already done amazing things with electric vehicles, and plan to have a driverless car that can remain independent 90 percent of the time out by this year! Other popular companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have driverless vehicles in development and claim to have them out by 2020. Who knows what we'll see in 10 short years? Maybe the idea of a driverless public transport system will be a reality. Or maybe most will have an affordable self driving car. Whatever the case, one thing remains certain. Driverless vehicles have a big future ahead of them, and we are no where near done hearing about them.       ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B4B3827225BB,"Driverless cars seem like they would be a good idea and could very so work, under the right condidtions. Like the author said, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" That is a very good question considering people that drive with children or just starting out. I personally think that a driverless car could work if everyone would still be alert and aware or their surroundings. Some Companies such as Tesla, have aleady projected dates to when they plan to release a driverless car.

These cars have sensors on them almost everywhere on the car that alert you when you are about to hit something or tell you when you need to start taking control, such as in a traffic jam or if there was an accident on the road. Televison and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. And now that we finally have that technology, we are taking the next step to better safety, more quick and effecient driving in some cases, and probably more money in the pockets of these creators as well.

The people at Google making these cars seem to be very confident and sure about what they are doing. These cars would almost be used as a texi service or bus transportaion. But, they would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. So as far as I am concerned, driverless cars would be a great idea.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
1C2A0066C93C,"It is true that there will be a lot of benefits of having driverless cars in the future, utilizing this invention could mean less human error on the roads, having those cars to be used as public transportation could be really convenient since everyone will have access to a form of transportation especially those who do not have a car to begin with, but driverless cars might be too reliable. Although this is all well and good, there are challenges and hurdles driverless cars will have in the community, safety will still be a concern to some people.

If by any chance driverless cars are widely used and completely implented to our civilization, new laws will be made involving the safety of people when in a driverless car and everyone completely abandoned the concept of driving manually.

Now what if everything else fails and one day the driverless cars stopped working, no one will be able to get to their own destinations with ease, you will also never know when these machines will malfunction since they are completely automatic in terms of driving. Unless the issues are solved and driverless cars are safe and reliable enough, it should not be used by the community yet.

This technology is still new to us and poeple just started working on driverless cars. We as people should be a bit forgiving, and it is okay to give negative opinions about it. It just means those are the things they need to fix and it could help them improve driverless cars. I agree that a driver should be given an option for drivers to drive and use autopilot by simply giving us a feature of turning it on and off. I still do not have a good feeling of relying to machines completely, machines might be rarely making mistakes but they are far too unpredictable unlike having humans behind the wheel, which again, one of the reasons people have a concern about and requested laws and regulations from the government. In consluion, technology is great but it should not be controlling our way of life on a daily basis too much than necessary.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
321EDEE72F31,"My position on driverless cars is that they should not be apart of our future because of the negative aspects they bring. With these cars there may be a couple of positive things such as being more flexible then buses, but the negative side wins. In order for us to have driverless cars we are going to have to spend some serious money. As well as spendng all this money we don't even know if these cars are safe enough. Finally, is a driverless car if a human still has to be able to take control?

First of all, none of the tax payers are going to want to pay for these smart roads like talked about in the article. In the late 1950s they tested a car to run on a special test track, and although it worked it had a lot of expencive moving parts. Another question we have to answer is are these cars safe? Google says their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, yet it still has trouble pulling in and out of driveways. That's not the only thing either they also has a diffuclt time dealing with complicated traffic issues.

Finally, why would you want a driverless car if you still have to driver the care? They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but the human needs to stay alert the whole in-case the road ahead needs the human to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Although it lets you know when they need you to take the wheel, it watches make sure you sre always paying attention. And when the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. In the case of the driver wouldn't they just get bored waiting on their turn to drive the car.

People can keep designing cars that are ""driverless"" but until they can do everything a human can do they aren't driverless. They would also have to get states to make it legal to test computer-driven cars, let alone be able to sell them to people in their states. The laws would have to change in order to cover liability in case of an accident.

8A60E09A7062,"Driverless cars, are they all they are made out to be? I think not. The reason being is because it still needs a driver. It watches the driver instead of the road. And you have to be alert at all times.

This ""driverless car"" should not be called a driverless car. This car still needs a driver. Say your close to a wreck, the ""driverless car"" will alert you saying it needs you to drive around the wreck. do you really want a non driverless driverless car? I know iI do not.

This car also watches the driver. If it is watching the driver how is it watching the road? It cant do both at once. This is absurd. This car is just not as good as they made it out to be, in my opinion.

According to paragraph eight you have to be alert at all times. Since this car still needs a driver this car can alert you that you need to take the wheel at any given time. Therefore, if you buy this car be very alert.

In conclusion, I would not buy this driverless car for myself because A. it still needs a driver. B. it watches the driver instead of the road. And C. you have to be alert at all times.            ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F9FA6D6CF768,"I am against the idea of designing Driveless cars. For the simple reason, they may be more likeyl to cause accidents and you would be held responsible for the accident although you weren't controlling the steering wheel or the gas pedal. Althought it does seem like a good idea to have driveless cars, what were to happen if one day you got in an accident and the other drives tried to hold you responsible? If we all got to where we are driving driveless cars, there would be nobody held accountable for the accident and how would the accident damage be paid for? The good thing is that if you were on along road trip and needed to take a rest you wouldn't have to pull of to the side of the road you could just keep going and the car would drive for you. I have to say I do agree witht the vehicles that assist you when you drive tough busy areas or work areas, that is fine but if we were to make a car that did all the driving we would get bored and probably fall asleep driving. Which in the long run will cause accidents, as I said before accidents would be hard to decide who caused them. So I would say in the long run drivelss cars are a bad idea.

1FEFA2458071,"The development of driveless cars is more of a complication than an advancement. There are many issues involed with driverless cars including the possiblity of techincal difficulties, liability disputes, and the maintained awarness of the driver. There is no way to fully eliminate these promblems even with more technolody.

Everyone knows technology doesn't work as planned one hundred percent of the time. Therefore it is not a good idea to be completely reliant on the technology in driveless cars to function properly all the time. Someone could be seriously injured or killed by a simple techincal error, which could be avoided by the continued use of mannually driven cars.

The idea of human error could be argued against that piont, but then you also have the problem of liability. As the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, said, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This could cause hundreds of complaints and court cases arguing who pays the fine for the accident. Many driver's may even blame technology malfunctions to avoid taking responsiliby for accidents.

Yet another problems is making sure the driver stays focused. The article pionts out that psychological aspects of driverless cars could be a challenge as the driver gets bored waiting for their turn to take over. If the driver gets bored there is a good chance they will try and find something else to entertain them, such as electronics, which will take there focus off the road. Ways to keep the driver alert were mentioned in the article, but it wasn't stated what would happen if the driver ignored the alerts because they think the technology can handle it.

Driverless cars simply present too many problems and unanswered questions. What happens if the technolgy malfunctions while the car is driving down the road? Who's fault is it is someone is injured due to technology failing? How can you be sure the drivers pay attention and are ready to take over if needed? Manually driven cars are working well enough and don't present these issues so why switch driverless car?       ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6DD430E0A7CF,"in this passage it gives many examples on why driverless cars are good and it also gives many reasons why it is not. Honestly im on the no go side. There are a few reasons why. there is that when there are no drivers that means you dont get to enjoy family time. Another reason is that what would happen if something glitched and went out of control and killed someone who would get blamed for that the manufacture or the owner. the third reason is kids my age wouldnt get to enjoy driving for the first time or getting their permit. Those are the reasons why I dont think driverless cars are a good idea.

What I mean when I say family time is that when my family and I go on a trip we try to have fun playing the license plate game where you try to find the alphabet by going in order from a to z on peoples license plates. I would think that there wouldnt be as much fun if there was someone driving. another thing is everyone would get tired of eachother if no one was driving because everyone would be looking at eachother playing games and after a while it gets boring. If there was a driver the people that are getting annoyed with eachother can switch with the driver and then problem solved until someone needs to switch again.

I think that it would not be smart to get driverless cars cause of malfunctions glitches and other problems with electronics. Imagine that you are in your awesome new driverless car and you put your desination in and it goes, so your just sitting there and a malfunction happens and you hit a family thats on a walk would you be the one to blame for it or the manufacture. That would be something that would be a lot of trouble for the person who hit the family if they were driving there would be no malfunction or glitch that would happen. I understand the reason people want driverless cars but what happens if stuff like that happens how would the people with that car feel. People buying the cars have to think of all the posibilities that could happen if something in the car goes wrong.

I'm not sure how other kids feel about driving and getting their permit but I know I love driving anytime I can I will because the fact that I am so close to be able to drive around on my own, not having to ask people to take me places it makes me feel independent. If driverless cars come into play then kids wont get to feel that rush and the feeling of being independent cause it's going to go back to you asking your car to take you places not people. I know that not all teens my age want to drive or even like driving but the teens my age who do will miss out on it and it will suck and how will they feel if something goes wrong with the car.

All of the reasons I mentioned are because its all true just think on all the things it would take away from our society today. Kids wouldnt have as good of personalities as they do. Malfunctions would happen people could die and it would take tolls on the people who owned the car. The other kids my age wouldnt get to feel the rush of driving on their own. These reasons would change the society for the worse I think its better to have cars run on electricity not gas but not to where it drives on its own.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6163745AA739,"Have you ever been driving a car and wish that the car would drive for you? I wish that almost every time I drive. Some manufacturers say that there will be driverless cars by the year 2020. I think driverless cars would be a very helpful aspect in life. Driverless cars would benefit not only drivers but the world around them in many ways.

Driverless cars have many benefits. If the car is driving for us, people would be able to text and drive without worrying about not watching the road. By people being able to text and drive without worry, less accidents will happen which could result in less deaths from automobile accidents each year. New or young drivers who are not as used to driving would feel safer with the car in charge and not themselves. They would be able to drive less worried and feel safer.

These car could potentionally help people with a disability that results in them not being able to drive. This could benefit them because the car would do the driving for them and they would be able to feel more independant and safer on the road. People with babies or young children in the car often get distracted by crying or temper tantrums or even the child wanting something while in the car. If the car drives for them they can tend to the child without worrying about not paying attention to the road and putting the child, theirs and other peoples lives in danger.

Driverless cars would benefit not only drivers but the world around them in many ways. These cars would be a major advance in technology. They would benefit everyone and not just a certain group of people. These cars could help reduce the amount of accidents each year and reduce the amount of deaths from cars.

EF6504905F18,"Driverless cars are the future of transportation and should continue to be developed. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author offers several positive aspects of driverless cars.

Driverless cars allow the driver to bring in-car entertainment that use the heads-up display. This display dissappeares when the driver is need, making it a safety feature (Paragraph 8). This feature along with other technology keep the vehicle safe. The driverless cars use high-tech equipment such as sensors, cameras, a gps receiver, and lasers to allow safety for the passengers inside while the car drives itself. Some driverless cars can drive up to 90 percent of the time on their own, only needing the driver to take control in heavy traffic and heavy construction. Cars will be able to drive themselves at a higher percent of the time as technology advances. Several automotive companies, such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that fully drive themselves by the year 2020 (paragraph 10). These driverless cars would use half the fuel of todays cars and offer far more flexibility for public transportation than a bus.

Due to these reasons one can determine that driverless cars are the future of transportation and should continue to be developed and researched by automotive companies. These driverless cars would fundamentally change the world. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

E6C2FD3578B3,"Driverless cares are coming. It's true, though it almost seems something out of science fiction. Today, we have cars that can drive themselves with the aid of humans. This means that there is still a driver, though they won't be doing much except sitting and watching the road. They must watch the road as they may need to take control of the car if there is an accident, construction, or if a road is closed off for another reason. This is a far cry from what we think driverless cars to be. Of course, the technology is there, it's just a very basic state of it. Most of what is there, the basics, is still very complex.

In my own opinion, yes, driverless cars are the way of the future. However, there is still use of a driver within the driverless car. So maybe not calling them driverless cars as a start, perhaps independent cars or auto cars. Having a driver still within the car can help, it may be that some places aren't mapped on the maps within the car. This may mean that the driver will have to take over, placing the safety of others into the hands of the driver. The thing with the driverless cars is that if there is an accident, whether it be man-made or machine error, whose fault is it? This is a big question, with many different answers. The truth is, there isn't laws in place for this, as there are no true driverless cars on the roads. We could pin the blame on the driver, for not taking control at the right moment to prevent a disaster. The same could be said for the manufacturer, for creating a faulty program within the car.

Today, the problem with cars is simple. They are dangerous. There isn't a bigger risk today than getting in a car and driving. Hundreds of people die or are injured in a car accident today and most of them are due to humans. A driverless car could reduce the amount of accidents and deaths on the roads. There still is need of people being at the wheel of the vehicle, but with less human interaction of the vehicles operation, the less likely it is to result in failure on the drivers part. There is also a possibility of it helping drunk drivers. If someone gets into the vehicle, they could tell the car their destination, and be on their way. This could result in less accidents and less deaths with vehicles involved. However, on the flip side of things, this may not help. If a third party company creates a faulty program for the vehicles for a big company, the blame will be pinned on the big company for outsourcing. This results in more strict laws on driverless cars and could result in there being less appeal to the idea of a driverless, or semi-driverless, car. We're still a few years from having driverless cars, and even more from having completely driverless cars.

My opinion is that self driving cars could help our society. We could gain so much from this, most of it being less accidents and deaths from something that is so important to many of our lives today. Taking the risk of getting in a car with someone who is new, elderly, or drunk is huge. Today, that risk is garunteed with consequences. Most of them are bad, with either injuries or death some big ones. Tomorrow, that risk could decrease with semi-driverless cars or completely driverless cars. The possibilities are endless with a car that rarely, if ever, requires human interaction on the road.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
2983A5DC1E8E,"This idea on making cars that drive on there own its sounds pretty cool but the money put into and the accidents that come from it are waiting this would be the worst mistake in history. Any car itself is very dangerous to be in while driving because of maybe your driving skils or other peoples driving skills. The time and effort put into this experiment will be hard and confusing but it would be a big waste of time for the makers of the car and the manufacturers on the company. People and companies say this would be a good investment and the best choice ever but if everything turns out bad your company is going straight down the drain.

There are many reasons this is a horrible idea and a big waste of time and money. This would be very dangerous for the drivers and other drivers on the road anything could happen in a matter of seconds anf you could take someones life or even your own life. Manufacturers say this will be a great acheievment i agree but the chances of this coming out as a positive invention is beyond me. Its dangerous enough on the roads with cars but by making cars driverless is beyond dangerous it will cause so many distractions and so many deaths.

The cost of making these cars and testing them will cost so much money and if the cars dont work and experiments with them dont work it will be drastic. Alot of people will be paying for these experiments with there taxes ands thats not fair for people that work hard for there money to just through it away on the invention. This would also be a big problem in are money and state money because if it doesnt work and they wasted all that money are state could possible become in debt. All this money put into will be a waste and companys will probably be shut down and that will be the end of it for them.

The risks that we are taking are really risky there are so many things that can go wrong and that will cost you and other peoples lifes. Its dangerous enough with drunk drivers and children walking on roads but if the driverless cars get invented this will cause so many accidents and possible alot of deaths. The accidents could be caused by anything messing up in the car sensors or the brakes. The brakes or sensors could stop working or jam up and drivers wouldnt even know if there sleeping that would be it for them and also if people or other drivers are around that could possible end there life just for cars that can drive by there selfs.

A positive, according to the passage is ""that cars have sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Having that sensor can keep the driver alert of the road and drivers around. Another positive would be"" the seats vibrating, they are to alert the driver when the car is in danger of backing up into an object"". That is important because things such as vehicles are closer then they really are in the mirrors. So when your backing up, you could be closer then you think and without the alerting of the vibrating seat, you could tap someones car, which would lead to some very exspensive bills for you or worse losing the right to drive. This all sounds great but, there are negatives too to these amazing cars, unfortunatly. Say you have and older driverless car and the sensors don't work as quickly and you hit someone from behind. You say you were paying attention or your car didn't say anything, who's fault is it really then? Is it your fault, should you be charged or let off because of a ""bad"" car? We all know technology is nice, fast ,and very helpful but, we also all know you can't always depend on technology. It shuts down or gets viruses, or could just die on us at the very time we need it. If you were in a car accident and you were the one that had been hit by a young driver and the young driver says ""my car didn't do anything"", you would want to say the young driver was probably on the phone but you don't really know. Say the driver wasn't on the phone and the car really didn't do anything to keep her from hitting you. What do you tell the police, who do I blame?

I think the positives stand out more then the negatives because they really do help. A elderly with there lisence is on the road and she/he has to slam on there breaks but just couldn't do it fast enough because there so slow and old, the ""Smart Car"" can help by alerting her/him quickly before she/he sees that everyone has slowed down because of an car accident up ahead that she/he can't see. Teenagers are young and dumb, they are always destracted by there phones, if there eyes are on the phone then whos watching the road? Teenagers get in horriable accidents everyday because they do silly things like texting while driving. The Smart Car can keep them focus and alert them on whats up ahead as well as what's around them. Some Smart Cars won't let you move or do anything untill you put your seat belt on, a seat belt can save you. Smart Cars can save lives.

More of these driverless cars or Smart Cars should be made. They really have brought down the number of accidents. I actually have a Smart car or a smart truck and it doesn't let us down. It will not let you turn on the radio or start the car unless everyone has on there sear belts. It says ""welcome"" too everytime you get in, such a nice car. Our car has cameras on all four sides of it. the most usefull one is the back camera, it shows everything behind us. We are a big family so when we go grocery shopping, it's a lot of food, sometimes we can't see out the trunk window. How would we know if a car was coming or a family was walking by? What if a dog ran pass or a child ran pass, the Smart Car quickly alerts us by blinking rapidly and making loud beeping noises, the TV in the front of the car shows us what's behind the car or whatever the cameras are showing so my Mom can quickly stop the car so whatever's passing through dosn't get hurt or we don't mess up our nice car.

6EBCC596B259,"Sometimes you need to go somewhere but just don't feel like driving. Or maybe you are going on a vacation but don't like to fly so instead you drive. Driving for hours at a time is no fun at all. That's why they've come up with the solution to that problem, driverless cars! You may only need to drive when the roads get bad, there is roadwork going on, or when you have came across an accident. This makes life much easier! Now you can relax, and not worry about the road near as much as you would be if you were driving the whole way.

Another problem with the cars we have today is the gas mileage. Most of the cars we have today have terrible gas mileage. With gas prices being around $2 or more you want to use the least amount of gas that you can. WIth driverless cars you may only use half of the gas that you've been using. Can you imagine that? If you get 20 miles to the gallon you may now get up to 40 miles per gallon! The article says,"" The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's..."". If you're the person that doesn't like to fly but wants to go on vacation this car may be the best thing to take for the drive. Because you wouldn't use near as much gas as you originally would. And as I said before with gas prices how they are today, you want to save as much as you can!

Maybe you aren't going on a vacation but you choose not to drive and take the bus to work instead. If you work morning shift trying to load a bus with hundreds of other people around 4 or 5 in the morning is not fun. Not to mention there usually aren't enough seats so you may be left standing the whole ride to work. That doesn't make a very good start to your day. The owners of the bus(es) could have some driverless cars as well. Driverless cars would have way more flexibility than a bus or even a taxi. They may also even have more flexibility than most cars that we use today. The articles says,"" Offer far more flexibility..."". This shows that driverless cars offer more flexibility than a regular car, bus or taxi. That means, that you day may not be ruined because you had to stand the whole ride to your job.

Another great thing about these driverless cars is that they don't take on more then they can handle. They alert the driver before they need to take over the wheel. Because, of course driverless cars can't do everything that us humans can do. So if you come across some roadwork or an accident your car may alert you that you need to take over until you get passed that. This isn't such a bad thing though. It's much better to have to take over the wheel then it is to crash because the car took on more then it could handle. The article says,"" They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues..."". So the only time you'd have to drive is when your car feels its better for your safety if you take over the wheel.

The last great thing I'm going to tell you about driverless cars is that they give you plenty of warnings before you have to drive. Some people are saying that it would be boring to just sit there and wait for your turn to drive. But they are working on putting systems in the cars to where they can entertain you. However, the entertainment will shut off as soon as its your turn to drive again. The article says,"" Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be shut off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to a driver trying to text with a cell phone. So, you can be entertained but you can also be warned before you have to drive that way everyone is still safe!

In conclusion, driverless cars can be a great thing for us! They use half of the fuel that today's cars use. They have way more flexibility the today's buses, taxis, and even some cars. They don't take on more they can handle, instead they tell the driver to take over. Lastly, they entertain you but shut the entertainment off when it's your turn to drive so everyone is safe. So, driverless cars can be a great thing for us! ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Thats always going to be a issue most will always consider talking about next time they have an idea on the car. There are many things that go into creating these cars like money , who is smart enough to do it , who builds it , and what software goes into it. In the coming future will start to invest in these types of ideas that will shape our future.

Google cofounder Sergey Brin has been trying to figure out a way to build upon this idea that we can create a car without anybody that will come pick you up. Movies and Television have depicted what it would be like if our world had a system like that. If this is a big topic why hasnt our gonverment or anybody tried to invest in the idea of a driverless car. Well theres many things we have to consider. Who would be elgible , how much would it cost etc. In the back of my mind i would think would happen if this wass actually a thing and somebody was in the car and it ran off the road or something even worse would happen. What would happen to cab drivers would they lose their jobs ? So there are many factors that go into creating new things. In Paragraph 8 the first sentence reads "" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver ? "" that question can be answered in a sence we would still need to be in the car but would we be controling the car or would we sit back and relax? Theres no problem with that but what happens when there is a car acciendent or a traffic stop infront of you will your car alert you on whats happing ? Will you need to take control of whats happing , basically how ssmart is your car ? In the near future i look forward to seeing the first car that can pick up a human and take them where ever they wanna go with out any problems.

This whole article is a wake up call. What will happen to all the other cars in the world ? Will everyone have to use this system. The public will react in a way that this a bad idea and that it should be scapped but we humans are not big on change. This will help out people who cant afford cars or need help getting home from anywhere they are . I hope that someone actually invest in the project google is trying to do and not reject it . This might cause a lot of people to lose there jobs but might create some at that. Technolgy is good for or race might help us learn more about what we are and what are our limitations. There are negatives but there are postives that outweigh everything that will happen in the future. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
64C8461FF6A9,"In the past, if society was told that cars would be able to drive themselves people would have called you crazy or would have laughed it off,calling it wishful thinking. Throughout life, we as humans have worked towards new advances in technology. We are always looking for a way to make life easier and simpler. The queastion is where so we draw the line. Saftey. Saftey has been a concern through time because we are less independent and have become more dependent on machines that could easily break, causes permanant damage. With this in mind, it is not safe to have drivless cars.

Having driverless cars could be harmful to not only to the passenger, but other drivers as well. The text states, ""In reality, Google has had cars that could drive independetly under specific conditions since 2009."" If this is the case, why are they just coming out with it. It is probably due to the fact that there are casualties. For example, the passage mentions that they have not fully developed the driverless car to handle complicated traffic issues, which is basically what driving requires. This could definatly result in drivers getting injured. Not only could they cause injures, but they could also cause legal issues.

If one thinks about it, most people don't want to rely on a car's driving if there is a chance it could cause an accident. There are no laws about driverless cars so it could be caos if something goes wrong. What if the car causes an accident because of an malfunction? There is no law about driverless cars, which means it could be blamed on the driver or the manufacturer. These are very concerning points that has to be taken in to consideration. Some may argue that driverless cars are better than human drivers.

Although there are numerous drawbacks to driverless cars, some may say they are better drivers than humans. The passage states,"" The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" This shows that driverless cars opperate breaks better than humans do.

Although driverless cars are good with brakes, thay can't be relied on enough to put ones life in their hands. The passage states,""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This means that even though the point of driverless cars is that humans don't have to drive, we technically still have to drive and stay alert. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of creating driverless cars if it is not actually driverless. Even though we rely on technoloy for various activities, that doesn't mean we have to rely on them to do everything.

The reality is that driverless cars are more trouble than good. They compromise the saftey of people on the road. They also don't have any regulations or laws, which could impact driving and saftey. When taking into account that there are no laws or order for driverless cars, it is no question that driverless cars should not be sold to society. We,as humans, have a responsibiliy to protect and mantain the saftey and life God gave us.          ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6EE8ECA52A6A,"Could you imagine everyone in the world driving in a vehicle that could control where and when you go somewhere? I think it would be absolute chaos. I couldn't imagine driving in a vehicle that could take control on it's own, It would be way to skeptical for me. I strongly disagree about driverless cars.

First, driverless cars are not 100% durable nor safe. Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, stated that ""General motors created a concept car that would run on a special track"". That track for these driverless cars were embedded with electrical cables that sent radio signals to the front of the car. In reality, no roads have any electrical currents running through them to make any car more secure. It's illegal in many states to even test computor cars because this company hasn't proved their car reliably safe. Driverless cars are in my opinion, not safe.

Secondly, in this whole artical, I didn't hear one thing about the driverless car being able to sense any size animal. Animals cause many accidents or deaths in the U.S. Animals are dangerous when you're driving, and many are unpredictable. This car has lots of little gagets and electronics in it, I think it should at least help you predict or let you know when a animal is approaching.

Lastly, weather is another big factor when you're trying to drive safely. Driverless car can't even predict when it's snowing, raining and such. When driving in dangerous weather and areas, it's very important to stay consistant, to stay calm, and to keep focused. Driverless cars dont have any emotions, they're not worried about the persons family waiting at home for them, or if the human in the car dies. Cars with a lot of technology have a better chance of screwing up, or something to go wrong with the vehicle.

To sum everything up, computor cars cannot be trusted. Driverless cars can't determine when animals are approaching nor can determine the weather or what the roads are like. ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at ALL times"". Computors aren't meant to be in control of our lives or our loved ones lives.

597092C49999,"I believe that driverless cars would be benefitial. 90% of the time you don't have to drive. There is an in-car entertainment system so that you can relax and watch movies or whatever you want to do while the car is driving you to your destination.

But when the sensors in the car know you're in the driver seat, the entertainment will shut down so that you can focus on your driving. No other cars are like this one; sure there are the cars that can steer themselves or brake themselves, but they still need you to drive the car. The driverless car won't need you to drive it because it can drive itself. It's really an awesome car.

There are still certain states that have laws that state that the car would only be safe IF there is a human driver in control of the wheel. But, with the more advanced technology, they can show the states that the driverless car is perfectly safe. They would also help with decreasing the amount of accidents the United States has dramatically.

In conclusion, I believe driverless cars are very safe, very reliable, and very cool.  ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FB6D4F0A03CD,"My opinion on driverless cars, i think it would be a stupid idea because i love to drive and im sure there are alot of other people who love to drive. Driverless cars could be a big problem, what if a driverless car had a malfunction and could wreck and kill somebody. Im sure the goverment would disagree with this idea because they love to make money, and all the money to make driverless cars would be outrageous, and that could make the goverment go in dept and it could ruin alot of things.

No details support my position because im against it, like i said i love to drive and i wanna be able to go wherever i want in the future and not have to worry about not having my own car because driverless cars just sound stupid. What if these driverless cars have a malfunction and just took off on its own i wanna be able to have my own car and drive on my own, because what if i end p getting a audi gr im sure ill be the one wanting to drive by myself and like i said everyone loves driving so i really dont like the idea.

These people who make the driverless cars such as nissan and audi, how do they know they can even make these cars to where it wont wreck on its own, or get us to where we need to go, the only thing i think would be cool about it is if i am tired and im driving and i need to go to sleep and the car could drive on its own, but what if a deer jumped in front of the car and the car is going 60 mph the car isnt just going to stop your going to wreck. If they really wanna make these cars they need to have good protection like a tank or sometin because that would be safe.

If we build these cars people can just sit and relax, and not have to worry about traffic, car crashes, or even just steering the wheel. They however do not know how much money, and or workit takes to have driverless cars of the future My personal opinion about the cars is, I think it will take too much and money and work to have self-driving cars.

Scientist are building new, revolutionary things everyday, so why haven't they found a way to make everyone a driverless car? Well, that is driverless cars arent really driverless; the cars still need a driver. Of corse of the cars have highly advanced sensors in every nook and craney, but in certain situations the car would have to let the driver take over.

Even if the self-driven car provided to be some new technology for everyone to oogle at; eventually it would get boring, they wouldnt be worth the money, and people would stop buying them.

25182FD1938E,"There have been many debates on whether or not driverless cars should be a thing. Yes, there are ups and downs of these cars, but you're always going to have those no matter the case. I believe with our technology advancing that we need to start working on some way of cars controling themselves.

One reason why I believe we should keep developing these cars is Google has had these sort of cars since 2009. If our society has been using them one way or another and if our technology keeps advancing, in 10 or so years we can find a way to make them safer. We don't have to release them any time soon, but wait till they are safer and have been tested and proved their way into pursuading people they are safe.

This can either be a pro or a con. The drivers have to stay alert and take over when the car needs it. They aren't made to know how to go around traffic and roadwork, so when the car sends an alert the driver can take over. I take this as a pro because it seems safer than leting your car try to work its way through roadwork on its own. When you have control you feel safer, but this can also be a con. When you hear ""Driverless cars""

you think that you won't have to do anything when thats not the case, yet.

In conclusion, driverlass cars still have a way to come, but with our technology advancing more and more every year these cars will be safe and driverless in just 10 years. The cars we do have that may be released aren't driverless, but they have a safe way of letting the driver know when to take over. Our society will be changing in more ways than we can imagine in just a decade.         ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
0646B208EF8E,"The future is in the present. What seemed like a mere dreaming is now coming to life! New techology has helped with many advances today, for example smart cars. This concept is fairly new, but it has already sprouted problems. These dilemmas are complex; therefore, the world is still not ready for driverless cars.

Throughout the years many companies have tried to make this new idea happen, yet it is a new concept. ""For example, in the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. ... These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This shows that driverless cars are not a smart idea. Now a days people want something pratical and fast: smart-road systems are niether pratical or quick, because it would be expensive and it would take time for the roads to be upgraded. Once they saw the expensives it would take, they let go of the idea. After this idea of smart-roads epicly failed, other came up with the idea of smart cars.

Even though smart cars have been effective, they are still not able to drive themselves. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents,"" smart cars have programs to assists the driver,not to drive themselves. Humans will still have to be alert on the road, so it will not going to help the driver. What is the use of cars that can drive themselves, if when the driving conditions get tough humans will be needed?

Another important issue (if these driverless cars come out), is who will be to blame for if an accident happens- the ""driver""

or the company? Because the person in the car will be assisting the car, the car should be to blame for. Since the smart cars are made to drive themselves, then all people involved in the accident would be victims.

Due to the information, it is safe to say that driveless cars are yet to be imereged into today's life. The people of today spend most of their day doing something, in my opinion they are ready to do nothing. Is one going to enjoy this break, though- maybe not, becasue though they are just passagers the car might need assists? Therefore there is no need for cars that will get only part of the job done.

A35EA0DE65CF,"Think of how many car crashes a day steal loved ones away from us. Think of all the mothers and fathers, sons and duaghters, and friends that are gone as the result of someone's careless mistake. The resaons behind most crashes is plain old human error. Well, what if we removed human error from the equation? If we take the driver away from the wheel and put them in the passesnger side, imagine how drastically the rate of crashes would decrease.

In todays modern world of advanced technology, we already have cars that can nearly drive themsleves. As the artical points out, there are cars that can drive themselves except when complecations arise such as traffic jams and roadblocks. Google's Toyota Prius has multiple sensors that moniter the area around the car and allows the car to funtcion as if there was a driver behind the wheel. Sensors can also allow the car to brake faster than a human could in emergencies and reduce the power of the engine.

The laws reguarding computer driven cars are all concerned about saftey, as they should be. Although, if a company, such as googlel, could create a perfect driverless car, shouldn't those laws be changed instead to any driverless car must be thouroughly tested and cleared by an organization or group not apart of the company itself to make sure there are no problems whatsoever. Also, in the event of any accedent caused by the car, the blame should undesputibly fall onto the company. The risk of crash would be outweighed by the benefits of driverless cars, though. Even in the event of an unlikely crash, there would still be fewer crashes than ever before.

Another benefit driverless cars offer is the time saved. How many of us have been late to work, a meeting, or school bescause of traffic? Traffic is genereally cause by wrecks or roadwork. While roadwork cannot really be avoided, with driverless cars, there would be nearly no wrecks at all. Then no one would need to sit in a mile long traffic jam as someone else gets their promotion at work becasue they are not there. Also, no one would miss their turn or get stopped for running a red light and have to wait to get their ticket. As the saying goes, time is money.

Even thoug a toatlly driverless car has not been invented, we are very close. Along with the extra safety that comes with humans no longer driving, time wil be saved, along with money. Las wouold aslo be changed so that the passengers in the car would not be to fualt in the instence of an unlikley crash.

451768D7641C,"The development of a driverless car is a stunning concept. Though it may seem like a wonderful idea, the negative out-weighs the positive when it comes to this. The amount of problems that can come out of this is not worth the risk. From health risks to the price, negative results from the driverless car are iminate. The development of driverless cars will have negative results.

One way that something tragic can come out of this is the safety. Without the skill of a human at the wheel people are at the mercy of the cars intelligence. Manveuring around crashes and contruction will become an immensely more tedious job. Also the dangers of the car not knowing the terain of a certain place could also pose as a major safety risk. Also, with a vehicle with this amount of technology, it is bound to develop glitcthes. Things like this put the passengers lives at risk.

Another negative of the driverless car would be the price. With an advanced car like this it would only be accessable to the wealthy. Alienating a large group of potential buyers. With this information a person can assume that it would not catch on and die off quickly. Also, the fuel of the vehicle would also be extremely expensive. Making the car a burden to have if an individual is taking a road trip.

The manufactureres would also have to consider what the people think about it mentally. Some people actually enjoy driving a vehicle. Those people would be less likely to purchase such a car. This would make it even more difficult to sell the car. Since most people are already lazy, making a driverless car would not help in their favor. Driverless cars would take the work ethic right out of people. Making people more dependent on technology is not a positive thing.

To conclude, Driverless cars would have a multitude of negative results. Although it may be nice to not have to drive, the risks that are factored in makes it not worth it. Considering the safety of the buyers is what automakers should put first before anything. Cars like these pose a great number of cocerns for the country.

0DABBA148FF5,"As time goes by, there are many things that change the world everymintue. The ideas of humanity has lead the world to a different direction. One example of this is the developement of the diverless cars. For years many creative people have always dream of making this real to help humans' enviorment, transportation, and safetyness. If this developement of these driverless cars is to help humans improve their lives than the developement should countinue.

If people are going to invent something that helps the humans they must as well invent something that helps the enviorment. In todays world we know that there is a lot of chemicals in the air and that many of us are affected. Actually everyone is affected be it. If the amount of gas is reduce in half and maybe we can safe todays' world. Wiht the reducement of contamination in the air the more safer is the air for humans to be able to breath it in.

In today's world transportation is assensional in our lives. Because today's society has made humans move and have faster lives than a human that lived in the 1700s would have we depend more on cars or anything that has four wheels and a motor. Just image being in New York City and not being able to get a taxi or always arriving late to imortant meetings. In this kind of problems the diverless cars are able to fix this since they offer far more flexibility than a bus and finally you are able to get to place on time without a problem.

The most important goal of creating the diverless cars is for the safety of humans. As the years pass people have created sensors. Sensors can causes the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine of the car, allowing far better response and control than and human driver could mange alone.

The most important bit of technolopgy in this syster is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR."" A regular car requires simple parts at times such as a spark plug or a new battery perhaps some oil. If every car was to be replaced by driverless cars, who would have to pay for replacement parts the owner or the manufactuer. I guarantee you none of those parts are remotely cheap. Currently out of the various models of driverless cars one with potential was started by engineers at Berkeley, but their model requires roads to be updated as well with magnets to alternate polarity. That would be alright but it would be an unpractical amount of money that taxes wouldn't help pay for much.

Everyone looks foward to the feature because of new technology that could make life easier but we really dont think about the bad that can come from these new divices. In my personal opinion I think that the negative aspects outweigh the positive aspects when it comes to driverless cars.

Even though driverless cars can possibaly be good for the economy because they use half the fuel of today's taxis they also have a large amount of cons that many people don't ever think about because they are blinded by the fact that these cars can basically get you where you need to go with little to no assistance from you, the manually driver. Even though driverless cars can get you where you need to go with hardly no assistance from you there will also be times when they do need your assistance, like if there is a accident or when there are road closes ahead. Although the car can alert you will you be to destracted by other things, such as cell phones, to pay attention to the signals that the car is giving you? Many drivers are probably more likley to to get bored while they are waiting for their turn to drive and this can result in accedents or something of that nature becaue you, the destracted driver, has missed the warning signales that the car is giving off to you.

Also people look at the aspect that just because they might be saving money by getting these cars because they will save money on gas and think that they are getting a better deal. But however, these cars are basically computer cars and if there is a problem with electrical pieces in the car it could be very pricey. Also since these cars are besically ran off of these computers that means of a part if messed up th car will not function properly.

Even though these cars can possabily be safer for the public when it comes to drunk drivers, what if these cars have a malfunction or technical diffuclitys? That could also be very harming to the public and you. If these driverless cars has a malfunction it could also put your life in danger along with the other people around you.

In conclusion, driverless cars has its pros and cons but when you actually think about it, the cons outweigh the pros. Just because you have this driverless car does not make you anymore safer than a person with a non driverless car. Just like regular cars, driverless cars has cons to it as well.

I believe that autonomous cars shouldn't be used until they can do everything that a human can behind the wheel.

I do not think that autonomous cars should be used in public until they are perfected. There are quite a few reasons why they should not be used yet. First, they can only drive in specific weather conditions. Secondly, They are not completely driverless. To me, a driveless car means that there doesn't even have to be another person in the car for it to perform like a regular vehicle.

And i do not trust car munufacturers with video footage of random people.

Finally, i don't believe that driverless cars should be used yet because they can only go 25 mph by themselves. Which means they can only be driven on side streets mainly.

E25BB42A9862,"There are many arguments as to why these new ""driverless"" cars can be helpful to society. Although, there can also be problems that come with driverless cars. My position on these new-age cars and technology will be explained in the following paragraphs.

I presonally believe that using autonomous cars in the world is very far-fetched. It's a concept that doesn't seem probable to me, and I don't exactly understand it. There are so many problems that are present with these cars. Things malfunction and don't work correctly with technology all of the time. Having these cars than run using a large amount of technology like sensors, the LIDAR system-which creates a viewing field for the car-and much more, it is very possible that one small thing in any of these systems could go wrong, causing an accident. Another thing that has to be taken into consideration is that when an accident does occur, who is to blame-the driver or the manufacturer? That problem alone causes much controversy over driverless cars.

However, there is a large difference between driverless cars and driver-assisting cars. I have a much different opinion on cars that assist the driver in a situation. This technology can be very useful to drivers. For example: there's antilock brakes that are very advanced today that use sensors to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids. This technology is very helpful, making it easier for drivers that are in danger to prevent losing control on the road, injuring themselves, or potentially even death. In this situation, what would a driverless car do? It is very possible that this car would know how to react to such a situation and could cause a dangerous crash.

In conclusion, I personally do not agree with the idea of driverless cars at all. There are too many dangers that come along with this technology. I prefer to be behind the wheel, controlling my car, and knowing what it will do. That is my position on autonomous cars.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

A car can not make a decision, as a human can do. Driverless cars can not be perfected because there has to be a human to do these things.

They're not as good as regular cars because they're not as safe, if you get in a reck the company might blame you for the accident and not the car, and finally the car would take the joy out of driving for people who love to drive.

The driveless car isnt as safe as a regular car. The driveless car runs on ""sensors"". As the text says, ""Without the option of smarter roads, maunfactures turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."" This is showing that the cars would need a lot more sensors which isn't safe at all. The sensors could malfunction and then when people go to drive, they put their lives in hands of these cars. They even say the car would have people take over sometimes, ""This means the hunan driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" People might start thinking they could do other things now that they wouldn't have to drive. They might read, text, watch videos, or maybe even just sleep. When the car needs the human to take over, the human might be distracted, and then they crash. The car wouldn't be safe. Not one bit

The companies value their proccess of their driveless cars and will pin the blame of the failure on someone else. If you got into a reck and the car was destroyed, who do you think they're going to blame? ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" They will, of course, blame the car for sure but most of the blame would pinned on the driver for not being ""too alerate"" or ""not focused enough"". People shouln't have to worry about that kind of law suit on their hands, but most likely they will.

Finallly, some people have a passion for cars, they love building them, driving them and, just everything about them. If people start selling drivless cars, instead of the normal cars, they wouldn't be doing what they love anymore. Their passion would be gone. ""The imformation from these sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on indivdual wheels and produce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" This is showing that the driver wouldn't have to do anything besides sit there and watch, how boring does that sound? People love to drive and for most cars is their passion, driveless cars would just take that right away.

In conculsion, making a driveless car would just be a bad idea because it wouldn't be as safe, if they reck, it'll be pinned on you, and it would be taking the fun out of driving away. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
90B3093F1EDF,"Ever since they were invented, there has always been a drive to improve cars. Whether making them faster or more fuel efficient, humans have always wanted to make them better. Hollywood movies have always made a big spectacle of cars, as they could make them do whatever they want in the fake films. Some of those hollywood ideas are no longer just ideas or wishes, because many automotive companies are working on the development of cars that can drive themselves. With this development, the cars would be safer and more efficient.

From day one cars have always had a risk factor, from the high speeds, to the reckless drivers. With the development of self driving cars, most of these factors would just dissapear. There would be no need to worry about reckless drivers or dangerous speeds, as there would be no drivers and the car could maintain a safe speed. Having self-driving cars would offer plentiful benefits. First off it was already metioned there would be no reckless drivers. Plus, the cars would have faster response times to accidents and obstacles. There would also be less accidents as the cars could apply brakes before a driver could.

When these smart cars are introduced to the public, traffic would be much more efficient. The cars would run on less gas, as the driver would consume more with their driving techniques. Also, the cars could find the fastest route to wherever the passenger was wanting to go. Plus, the cars would be able to move smartly and help keep traffic moving to avoid the enormous traffic back ups that usually occur.

The development of driverless cars are an inevitability. They wil be out on the road and keeping people safe. They will react faster and avoid collisions, saving numerous lives. Cars are still being improved today, but ones capable of driving without a human at the wheel are coming sooner than you think. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
45B7681DBE5C,"Everyone in their life can get a chance to drive, driving is one of our biggest freedoms. Some people are excited to get behind the wheel of a car and are really to explore the open roads. Other people are afraid and don't want to drive of they just don't like it. I was excited to be able to drive, but the hardest part of driving is learning everything paralle parking, going the speed limit knowing when to stop, how to make a three point turn, people need to know these things because it will keep them safe and their family and friends safe when they drive, so I think the ""Driverless Car"" is pointless and we shouldn't have them.

To began, cars now a days have become smarter, better, and safer for us to drive, it states, "" they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves,""

(Paragraph 7) this tells us that they infact are smarter then they were before. This is pretty amazing but what will happen when the sensors break and the person behind the wheel never really knew how to drive properly now we have a bigger problem. So I feel like that these driverless cars could easily break becasue technology is known to break or it will have a glitch in the system. Would you be alright knowing that the only thing from keeping you from rear ending someone is sersors? This would freak me out, it's already stressful enough making sure you pay attention to your surrondings. So I have a feeling that the sensors could very easily mess up even if the manufacturers have tested it thousands of times.

To continue, I don't trust having technology driving me around place, I don't think it's very safe. I feel much safer riding with my parents because I believe that they are amazing drivers and they know what they are doing. But, if I was riding with them but realised that they weren't driving but the car was I would start to panic because every time we would come to a stop I don't want to end up rear ending someone. I would also feel safer if I was driving myself becasue I would be more focused on the road because when you're driving it's not really youself that you have to worry about it's other drivers. If you were in the driverless car and a car pulled right infront of you in an intersection will the sensors be able to stop you in time, if you were driving yourself you'll have a reaction to stop if you are pay attention of course.

Finally, I just htink the driverless car is usless and not something we need. I say that because people spend a long time learning how to drive and it takes time knoing how a car actually works. What's the point of me doing about thirty days of drivers ed and driving with an adult for fifty hours just to take a test to get my lisence. I put so much work into learning how to drive, so why would I want to use a car that I don't even really need to drive. It also stated, "" In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,"" (paragraph 7). This basically proved my point that this car will be usless because there's really not that many 25 mph zones where I live so you'll just have to drive yourself anyways. The car will also need your help navigation through work zones and around accident, so basically we are driving about 80% of the time anyways so why waste your money.

So I believe that the driverless car is not a very good idea for us to drive. I believe that the car's sensors will easily mess up then you'll be the cause of an accident. I feel safer driving myself and riding with my parents becasue it's other people you really have to worry about and I always feel safe with my parents. Also, I believe that will be usless because I've spent so much time working to get my lisense and I don't want to through way all that hard work and the car can only handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph which I rather just drive myself.

2AFF06240C43,"I agree that driverless cars are a developing idea. I do like the fact that these cars should be used by the public. They could lead us to a whole other revolutionary idea with the way the human race lives our lives. It could help us all out with our neccessaties. Also it could help us with other sciences in our lives such as medical assisstants and drivers. Next, the ability to drive without a driver could help us alll in the aspect of the way on how we live our lives.

First, for example in the text paragraph 7 it says how the company of BMW has made the ""Trafiic Jam Assisstant"" which could help us drive up to 25 mph without the need to do anything at all. Driverless cars dont just help us at drving it helps us at being smarter. The science put into these cars to drive without any work is fascinating. If we could put that same science in other fields justy as medical, then the possibilites are endless. We could have assisstant doctors getting us tools that we need,when we need them, and alarming us when something is wrong.

Next, these cars are fantastic for elderly people who are unable to drive by themselves. They offer a sugnificant amount of assisstants for them so they dont have to rely on anyone else. Next, it could help keep us safe in our cars. For example, in the article in paragraph 7 it also states that these new cars have developed a drivers seat that ""vibrates"" when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. These cars can reduce the amount of vehicle incidents very much. Not only can they stop us from backing in to something but they can also stop us from being killed.

After that, they have video cameras also in every corner of the car to help the driver sense any danger around them. For Instance, in parapraph 4 they tell of how they have a ""spinning sensor on the roof that uses laser beams to form a constantly updated 3-d model of the car and it's surrounding. They need all of these so it could act as if a human being was in the driver's seat. Further more, these ""newer cars"" dont just give us new abilities, but also the new knowledge. They show us what needs improvement and what doesn't. Also, they help us guide our way to safety if we are lost.

To inculde, these cars could also lead us to anywhere we need. This is very important in case someone gets lost. For example, if someone is lost on a camping trip and is in the wrong spot there and needs assisstance, then there car could lead then to safety and tell them exactly where they are located. It could also serve as a discovery unit. For instance, if someone is in a new town or city then they need to know where the gas station, hotel, restaurant, etc are and there car would take them there. They would help them navigate to whereever there destination might be.

In conclusion, the need for cars that do not need a driver is very important to our everyday lives. They would help navigate, save, and make our lives easier. They would help our economy out tremendoulsy by reducing accidents and the death rate. Next, they would help with people who need it such as elderly and disabled people. Last, these cars are getting closer and closer to becoming a part of our daily lives already, because we have the science that helped us develop these types of cars now.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

The new cars that they are making should only have safety features that are computer, not the whole car. If a whole car was a computer, what would you do, sit there and eat? you wouldnt be paying attention, you'd be all relaxed, and probably sleeping if you were tired. There are many things that i can say are bad for being in a car that is a computer with a frame, an engine, exhaust manifold, and many more parts. That is why i disagree/ dislike the fact to have a computer drive you.

The facts are that there are people building cars that are partially computer driven. For the car that could be bad or good, but if it faults you wont be able to know until it acctually faults while driving which is a huge safety hazard. The car is made for teens, and grown-ups to have fun and comfort or one of them.

The reasons I dislike/ disagree with the self drving is that everybody would become lazy/ on unintellegent about cars.

F1EB7660CE74,"I am totaly against driverless cars. I do not think that should continue they're production on these vehicles. Simply because they are already having issues. For example in paragraph two they say the car cannot operate or minuver through traffic , road blocks, accidents etc.

So what if there's a storm, or a tornado, or earth quake or something? Will the car know what to do then? If you're going to have to take over you might as well drive it yourself anyway. What could you possibly do for those short moments of time anyway? A driver is always supposed to stay alert and focussed no matter what. Whether you are driving or not because you never know what could happen. Safety first! I dont think a computer is accuipt enough or qualified to think , act, or make decisions a human is supposed to make.

Then what happens if you do decide to let the car do what it is programed for and ypou do get in accident or get hurt? Then what like they said in paragraphs 9 & 7, the big argument will be who,s fault is it, the driver or manufacturer? Well my opinion is driver, because its states that the car wouldn t knolw what to do in these type of situations and youre werent focused and did not jump in when you should have all the more reason you should drive yourself so there will be no reason for this argument.

Owning a driverless car could be extremly helpful. Driverless cars will still require a driver who is paying attention to the road at all times. These cars could helpful, of course you would still have to pay attention to the road but you could relax more and not be as stressed out as you would when you are driving. There are negatives to owning a driverless car such as you, a driver or passanger, may not be safe. Technology can always have a fault, what if one of these cars drove you into the other lane causing you to hit a car or you run off into a ditch. What happens when to cars hit eachother, who is at fault. The driver is at fault of course, the drivers need to be in control of the cars. I don't think that the driverless car is the greatest idea because of all the accidents that could occur because maybe the driver falls asleep and the car makes a mistake, what do you do then. I think we should just keep our cars the way they are, I would feel more safe on the road with the car's control in my hands.

When I saw the title of this story I thought driverless cars would be amazing but as I continued to read through it, I noticed how bad these cars could be for all of the people. These cars could mess up and get you killed or hurt because you aren't paying attention and you aren't being in full control. I feel like more underage kids would think it would be okay to driver these cars because they don't take as much effort and aren't as difficult to learn about. I also think that some parents would let them too because they think it would be easier, but they are wrong. Driving one of these cars is just as dangerous as driving any other car in the world. It could be dangerous if you make it dangerous.

In my opinion they should not invest in producing driverless cars, what they should do is invest in making cars run off of things like water, air, or from solar energy. That would be much more effective for earth, it would stop global warming becasue it is reducing all of the fumes that are released into the air. These cars will make people more lazy than they already are. We want to help everyone live, not just make the rich people in the world lazy.

36E3A712A2CD,"The development of driverless cars will not be easy and it will probably take a long period of time to complete. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it is explained to us how the development of driverless cars is going and to point out to us all the pros and cons of these driverless cars. Should these cars be invented? I believe these cars should not be invented due to the fact that there would have to be many upgrades to roads which are expensive, safety concerns for passengers and pedestrians, and new laws that will need to be created to protect either the rights of passengers inside the driverless car or the rights of the manufacturers who built these driverless cars.

Driverless cars are a good idea to a certain point. These cars would not be a good idea because many things would have to be adjusted to existing roads, which would be very costy . In paragraph 3 the author says,"" These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This proves that cars like this would require many adjustments, that are not cheap, to existing roads and that the cars.

Our country is always looking for whats best for everyone, and having driverless cars may put people in danger. Manufaturers are planning to put some kind of form of entertainment in these driverless cars. Distracted drivers are very dangerous for pedestrians and the passengers in the car. The author states,"" Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and informatin systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over -- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This section of paragraph 8 can help prove my point because if manufacturers put entertainment in cars that would be distracting the driver which is not safe for the passengers and the pedestrians.

Many new laws would have to be created by the government to either protect the passengers in the cars or the manufacturer. Who would be responsible for an accident if the person in the driverless car got in a automobile accident. The author proves my point when he or she says, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault -- the driver or manufacturer?""

This quote helps prove my point because in this quote the author brings up the fact that there many be many problems when deciding who is at fault if an accident occurs in a driverless automobile.

In life there are many up and downs and pros and cons to everything. In this article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author points out many pros and con to driverless cars. I find that there are many reasonable pros and things that manufacturers should be proud of, but i also believe there are some things that the manufacturers need to think about.

If we let it keep accumulating like this we could be in big trouble. Power goes to peoples heads. It's in our nature. We can't let technology over rule us. We need to slow it down. What we have now is grand. What more needs to be done? We don't need to have driverless cars. Soon cars will be like human robots driving wherever they please.

In todays world we have a lot of advanced technology. You watch movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic World. We wonder when will we get that technology? Does it already exist just hidden under out noses? Who really knows. But the point is, is that if we let cars start driving themselves we could get laszy. That's not so good for our social status to the world. Most foreigners already assume we are fat and lazy and get everything handed to us. In some aspects this is true, but with driverless cars on the rise this could get worse.

There's also the fact that what would happen if the car didn't do what it was suppose to do; and it wrecked; and the owner; or a pedestrian got hurt.

This raises a lot of qestions and concerns. The main one would be who was at fault? In paragraph 9 it states that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This is good. Their are a lot of bad drivers in the worlds, but they know what to do in most cases. They know how to take control.

The practice of driveless cars are illegal in most states. Those states being California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. It's good that most states are thinking ahead. Why would something so fascinating and new be illegal to practice? They care about their people, and their safety.

In paragraph 7, it states that there are cars that are partially driverless. One being the 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car is a smart car. It works with the owner not just by itself. The BMW can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but it notifies the owner when it needs human assitance. This is all wrong. Cars shouldn't be doing that. Cars are going to become more human than technology.

In a lot of cases it's okay to have advanced technology. But this is too much. We need to start thinking about what will happen instead of what we will gain out of it. Think of what would go wrong. As the world advances we need to rememeber who exactly is in charge. This is why if we leave technology to do our work, it won't even be us anymore.

As time aged so did our technology by getting more vast and advanged. I am very against the new development of these new cars because I think they're not safe at all. A human should alsway have to drive on their own because anything couple happen. One minutue with your eyes off the road, a sensor being read wrong, alerts not going off like supposed too, or even the wrong alert going off. There are even many differen't laws that were pasted in different states to not allow driverless cars. You just never know what could go wrong and you'll simply have no control over what happens.

Driverless cars sound like a pretty cool idea right? Just think about it a driverless car? No way right?

You don't have to be contol over the wheel at all times. You can just sit back and let the car do what it's supposed to do. Eating breakfast on the way to work in the moring instead of wasting time at home. There countless amazing reason why this would sound like a marveless idea but then again you have to sit back and think about you and everyone else around you saftey.

Technology will always need a humans help for anything. Think about your phone wouldn't opperate without you assistance, computer, even a stero the list goes on and on. Think about your car driving by itself, what if you take your eyes off the wheel for about thirty senconds thinking your okay to grab something out the back seet real quick. Then something with the car went wrong? The you most likly would be ending up in an accident. Just for taking your eyes off the road for juts thirty senconds. Think about back into the stories it says to get the driver's attention quickly is to vibrate the drivers seat or flashing lights on the windshield to alert the driver but what if the driver doesn't have a quick respond like right away? Then boom, you crash and now you want to blame the manufactoring company. It woul just be better if you were awear on what's going on, on your own.

Technology isn't always perfect like just like humans, they tend to malfunction here and there. Looking back into the stories it talks about sensors being out on the cars. Have it ever came across your mind if a sensor read wrong? For expample, your pulling out of a parking spot and your car doesn't alert you fast enough that there is a car coming and the other car isn't paying attention. Now whose fault would that be? You'd blame the manufactoring company even if it was probaly your fault. It would just be a better idea to not put yourself in that situation.

People in other states are still waiting for the law to be passed like California, Nevada, Flordia, and many more. They're not even allowed to do test driving and stuff like we do everywhere else that's legal. They made it illegal for a very good reason and I believe it should stay that way. There are too many poeple on the road driving everyday and they would like to feel safe. They don't want something going wrong with the cars and accident everyday. They're doing fine with regular cars now, just be better off if everyone stayed that way.

You always have to be thinking about the poeple around you instead of just yourself. The car might be driving smart but poeple drive like idots. Think hard about your safety before getting these cars. There not a one hundred percent guarentee. Yeah the cars sound like a really good idea and a fun new way of driving but it coould be really danergous as well. Therefore, you have to put your saftey and anyone elses safety first.

If one day the systems controling the cars crash everyone will be forced to walk to get to where they need to be. Self-driven cars will lead to lack of attention on the road which in turn could lead to accidents.

As a young teen the one thing everbody looks forward to most is getting their drivers license. Everyone looks forward to the wind in their hair as they drive around without the company of an adult. If cars become autonomonus teens will no longer get to look forward to acheiving their licences or get to experiance the thrill of driving a car for the first time.

If cars become able to drive themselves millions of people will be out of a job. New jobs will have to be persued, and quite honestly there aren't enough jobs out there for everyone that would need one. The unemployment levels will reach an all time high, pushing America further into dept.

You call several friends and they inform you that the same thing happened to them. The system is down and there is no way for you to get to work. Systems crash, it's inevitable, all it takes is one crash for people to realize they rely to strongly on these vehicles. What if the systems crash while on the road? Hundreds of accidents will take place resulting in hundreds of deaths and injurys. Autonomous cars are a major accident waiting to happen.

Along the lines of accidents, self-driven cars will allow riders to not feel the need to focus on the road. Attention will be on their phones or on the ""in-car entertainment and information systems."" If attention leaves the road many accidents could occur. Say a car malfunctions and shoots out of a side road right into the side of the car your sitting in. Your car slids into incoming traffic, right into the path of an autonomus semi that doesn't have time to stop. Doesn't sound very safe, does it?

The text say that a Toyota Prius was modified with numerous cameras and sensors to make this driverless car mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Buying a car made with all those modifications will cost you. Also, adding more systems in the car such as, entertainment and information systems, will cost money too.

Driving was always fun to everybody, but with the idea of a driverless car, the fun goes away. ""The phsychological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" To fix the problem, BMW project manager says that they have to interpret the driving in a new fun way. BMW says they will add entertainments systems. That is a dumb idea because you need to be paying attention to the road.

Driverless cars, will become worse thorughout the course of its production. There will be failures within the car itself and the technology inside it. There will also be more problems to worry about, such as the systems breaking and the car breaking down. Do you really want to sit and watch a computer drive you to your destination?

B0E2A499FC5A,"The development of driverless cars pose no threat to anyone. Driverless cars are not completely driverless. The cars will still need assistance from the driver. ""Special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" (p7) It has been said that the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all of these cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

The cars that Sergey Brin forsees would use, ""half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" (p1) Driverless cars have been well tested and have been modified repeatedly. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (p2) Google'sdriverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Although Google's cars are not truly driverless, meaning they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents, not crashing when having driven half a million miles is miraculous.

Really, there is no danger that really stands out when speaking of driverless cars. They were specifically engineered to do one job; that job being to get its passengers to and from their desired designation without crashing. The most important bit of technology on Google's modified Toyota Prius woul have to be the spinning sensor on the roof. ""Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" (p4) The combination of all that has been modified and manufactured for the driverless car is necessary for it to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

Car manufacturerers are not starting from scratch recently. ""In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" (p5) When getting in a driverless car, it will not me like getting in a wagon at the top of a hill and being pushed. You will be in as much control as the car if need be. The car itself will give you far better chances when it comes to not crashing. ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" (p5)

This has been said repeatedly but once again none of the cars that have been developed so far are completely driverless. Human skills are still needed when driving these cars. As long as you get into one of these cars knowing that you will need to be alert, there is little to no chance of an accident occurring. ""Special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" (p7) Being alert when in a driverless car will not be as hard as it may sound due to the modifications that have been made to these cars. ""This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenevera problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" (p7)

You may be asking yourselves why anyone would want a driverless car that still needs a driver. No one likes to be completely helpless or bored and waiting to take their turn. Some manufacturers hope to keep drivers entertained and awake by, ""binging in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver is needed."" (p8)

This information goes to prove that driverless cars pose no real threat when driving other than when a driver gets in the car and is deliberately irresponsible and not paying attention. When in these cars stay alert and all will be well.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
3D3D96AFD65A,"I'm opposing the idea for driverless cars because, although it's a good thought, I wouldn't feel safe driving on a road where there is a car without a person. I was intrigued by the question in paragraph 9 when it asked, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fauly - the driver or the maufacturer?"" I think the maufacturer is to blame because they're the people putting these cars on the street although people are buying them and giving their lives to a computer I just wouldn't feel comfortable doing it.

I could see why people think that driverless cars are a good idea because in paragraph 2 Google states that their cars have driven half a millions miles without a crash, but those cars aren't truly driverless, they have a human sitting in it ready to drive and the car alerts them when there's roadblocks, when the driver has to pull out of the driveway, and when there's traffic issues.

Google and many other companys have been trying at this idea for years and have been very succseful with the expirement. The idea of a self driving car has snagged the attention of many people and especially Google who have acaully made this come true in 2009 when they made the first self driving car. These cars a have drove all over without a single acident reported.

So as you can imagine this sparks the question, Are self driving car safer on the roads then normals car? Well self driving car all based on sensors that detect anything and everything in the road. They keep with the speed limit adamatically, stop at aproprited time and also slow down when is needed. Adomatic cars will reduce the amount of accidents we have on the road by a lot. Accident are moslty caused by a driver, with adomatic cars, they will stop quicker than a person has time to react. But this plan will only work if everyone gets a smart car. Say if three out of four people get a smart car there will still be some normal cars left on the road, which with those cars an aciddent can be made. Self driving cars can avoid all the natural accident such as an animal running in the road or bad weather conditons. In addition to that many driver become sleepy or distracted when it come to driving, when self driving car are machines that will not do that.

With self drving cars there will be no need to get a license. Many teens struggle with passing the lenglthy test to get your license. As people age one of the most common things to get bad is eye sight. This self driving cars elders can still do the things they need to do such as go to the store or visit family with have to relie on other people for tranportation.

Self driving cars are going to be the safest option on the roads today. They aviod accidents, reduce the cost of normal veichals and are more efficent than normals cars. This is why these self driving google car should be developed.           ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F733B1C8CB49,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" should there be driverless cars? There are a lot of negative and postive things about this movement. My opion on driverless cars is that sometimes it could be good and sometimes is could be bad like for an example. when your very tired and you need to go somewhere your car can take you were you need to go without you having to drive it. If you are ever in a hurry your car can drive you without you being late.

Now for my opinion on the bad things about driverless cars. Driverless cars are also bad because you could be texting and you would'nt here your alert that the car gives you when it can drive at that certain part in time and you end up crashing into something or hurting someone. This means a human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.

I think that driverless car would be a good experiment because we would be able to see who could handle it and who can't handle it. Some people might think that they can handle it and they go and bye a driverless car and go to start it and dont no what to do but the other half would no what to do right off bat. I also think that the car would be more expensive than any car that has ever been made because if what it does this car is basically the future.

But why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver half of the time? Well i guess ill tell you why. Most of the people think that it would be fun sometimes because not often you get to drive a driverless car its interesting in my opinion. But in a way the car system is really a saftey system if you pay attention to what all that you are doing but if you don't it could be hazert.

Most of the driving laws focus on keeping people safe but what is you arent the one who crashed who's to blam? Traffic laws will even change new laws will need to be reinforced. If you crash into someone who also has a driverless car who crashed into who.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A32818600684,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming the author displays positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Although driverless cars are very fascinating, they pose several negative aspects including safety hazards, liability issues, and the car's technological abilities.

Safety is the most important thing when it comes to developing a driverless car. Right now driverless cars ""... can steer, accelertate and brake themselves, but all are designated to notify the driver when the road ahead required human skill, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" The driver must remain focused on the road, even in a driverless car. According to Dr. Werner, this poses a psycological hazard because a driver is prone to get bored while the car is normally driving. This can result in an accident due to the driver's faliure to respond to the driverless car (that needed human support, while navigating through a problem in the road). If driverless cars still need a driver, the car is still not safe enough to be out in the public because it is a risk to both pedestrians, passengers and drivers.

Furthermore, driverless cars can also lead to issues in traffic laws and liability. Since now traffic laws are made based on the assumpution that the car is under the control of a human, if driverless cars became available it would lead to problems in deciding what traffic laws will apply to what people. One very important issue posed in the article was that ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?""

Some people may believe that the development of driverless cars is a positive thing since our technology is capable to making driveless cars that are safe (to a certain extend) and have a ability to mimic human skills. Although this all sounds very exciting and futuristic, driverless cars are still not driverless. They still need human support , and regardless of the smart technology, any technology has the ability to malfunction, which will then lead to other issues.

To sum it up, driverless cars seem like amazing vehicles that can make transportation easier. However, if you look deeper, you can undertstand how difficult the development of these vechicles is. In this case, the negative aspects of driverless cars definately override the positive ones.             ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Right now without driverless cars their are becoming way to many accidents. More and more people are getting tickets by speeding and or texting while driving. With driverless cars, their will be a lot less accidents when texting. Also since the car is driving for you, it will go the right speed limit. Driverless cars still need some work, but in a couple years it will be fixed. Each generation is becoming smarter and smarter. So if we have started to make the hard part of the driverless car, imagine what we will be able to do in a couple years! Driverless cars can also help with traffic.

It could also possibly be good for the economy because the less fuel the car intakes. Another probable benefit would be non-use of oil since the cars could be controlled by electricity. It could be, with the right type of technology, safer than a regular car.

These benefits can be shown when the author says, "" The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" The author also says, "" Without the option of smarter roads manufacturers turned to smarter cars-but how much smarter did the cars need to be?

This is significant because these drivelrerss cars can use gas more efficeintly and possibly stop the use of oil. It is also significant because with all these sensors, maybe in the future, the driverless car can be safer because it will act as if a human were actually driving a car, and it could mimic the way we drive more accurately.

They can kind of help drive when someone is tired and can prevent accidents.

They help take people's lives out of danger.

I think the development of these cars is a good thing for the world.

To start off, the fuel needed for these cars is half of the fuel amount we use right now on regular cars, stated in the first paragraph.

That is saying that the amount you are paying now for gas would be cut in half.

There are sensors in these smart cars that have been placed everywhere around the cars.

In places such as the mirror, the wheels and on the roof.

These sensors may not be new, but they have developed into something amazing that helps protect.

The driverless cars have many functions that can help protect people in many different ways and situations.

Some of those functions include, antilock brakes and driver assisting.

They have come a long way in developin this driverless car.

Theses cars can now steer themselves, accelerate, and brake by themsleves.

There are some things that the cars may need done to make it perfect, but it is still one step closer to making our lives a little easier.

These cars will have in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.

These displays will be turned off when instantly when the driver needs to take over.

B8FF5353E626,"Yes, the driverless car has its ups and downs but in whole I truley belive this car is wonderful. I think it is a great oppertunity for people who don't always like driving, I can say for my self I don't always injoy driving because sometimes it gets confussing or makes me frustrated.

I think that having a driverless car will show weather people are responsible enogh for stuff like this. Obviously if a driver buys this car just so they don't have to worry about driving, or so they can text and drive, you can tell that they aren't responsible. But there are some people that acually care about rode safty and would treat this car with the same responsiblity as the other car.

There are a lot of ways that we can make sure people are paying attention, I really like the idea of how we can put cameras up to make sure the driver of the car is staying alert and paying attention to the road. Like the artical said, ""While the driver watches to road, the car watches the driver.""

With the cameras we can catch people wh do the wrong thing even if they don't have a driverless car! The cameras will be able to see people who look like they are speeding, they can see people that text and drive, they will also be able to catch the people that are under the influence of drugs and alchol. So there are postivies to the driverless car and making more driver safty to the other cars.

Like i said the driver still has to stay alert to the road, and one thing that will help that is how the seat vibrates when the car is in danger of backing into something. This will help if a person if having trouble see behind the car if they feel a vibration they know to take charge of the car. The artical asked, ""What if the driver wants to drive the car and take charge?"" I think with the vibrateing seats this will helps the driver to take charge.

And what I think is most imporant is, ""Who is held responsible if there is a car accident and someone gets injured? The driver or the manufacturers?"" I do know that car accidents are going to happen, weather you mean it or you don't. Even if you are driving a car that isn't driverless you can get in an accident, because there is awlays going to be that one person that drinks and drives or is texting someone, so accidents happen. On this question, I think it would be both the manufacturers and the drivers fault. I think this because, yeas the drivers should be alert to everything that is going on, on the road, even if they aren't driving. And it is part the manufactureres fault because they are the ones that trust us with this type of car, know that there are people out in the would that will take it for advantage.

At first when I read the title I thaught, "" A driverless car? No Way! I would never buy one of those."" But now that I read this I can say, that a driverless car would be great to have. So why don't we make it happen, because I know one day i would deffinatly buy one. And I will be one of the people that pay attention to thr road, and have ddirver safty.

These cars will never happen, and if they do they will cause many accidents in the future.

Say you were to get in a wreck while driving a driverless car, and the car wouldn't use its break so you went through a stop sign and hit another car and someone was killed in the accident.

It is cool that they drive themselves but there have been lots of accidents in the past and it would be harder for driverless cars to be able to dodge them or take a different route if its a recent accident. For example if you are driving down the highway and a car crash happens right in front of you, the driverless car would not be able to just detect it that fast and stop or move to the left or anything. If a dog runs out in the middle of the street and you run him over would you feel guilty for that even though you had no control over the car.

Even though it says cell phones are turned off while trying to drive people would find a way for the phones to not turn off.

It sounds like a good idea to help the environment, would you less fossil fuel but there are still risk that can happen with the technology.

The introduction of this article about Driverless Cars Are Coming talks about how if you can see the future where no one buys cars. Well the Google cofounder Sergey Brin is trying to do see the future with public transportation system that are driveless.

Sensing the World in the late 1950s General Motors created a car that could run on a special test track, but how is it going to help in the open road with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car on each highway that the only why that car would be able to run. In the the smart road systems it worked but they need a lot of upgrades to existing roads, something that is to much to pay for. Without the smart road there is no driverless car on the road.

Another issue driverless cars present is that it is illegal to test computer driven cars in some states. How can anyone be sure that driverless cars are safe if they can't be tested. What if the car's technology were to fail and someone getting injured. This also ties in with

Legal issues that will produce more conflict, for example who would cover liablility if there were to be an accident. In additon to that who's fault would it be the ""driver"" or the manufacurer?

If a car drives it's self then it would be no fun for people who have cars. This development is crazy because it will change many things. We should keep cars the way they are instead of changing them to something different that not everyone would like.

Many cars are already having many problems so why make a car that can drive its self? We should fix the problems in todays cars instead of worrying about trying to bring something new. People are putting to much in cars, such as sensors and computer hardware. These things might help but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. However it could be a good idea to always add safety things to the car, but not everything can be sure to always work. Anything can fail at anytime.

Technology is really advanced! Everyday people are working on something new because of how well technology is. If technology keeps on advanving people will make more things and come out with incredible things. Many of these things won't be safe. People have to think in the safety of theres and others. It is not a great idea If you let a car do everything for you because that could be dangerous. You should be able to control the car whenever you want . Imagine if you come to a stop sign and the car doesn't stop? that could seriously cause a problem. Somebody could get hit and that will not turn out good.

Other cars like BMW's and Gm have developed mny different things for cars. In the article for example says a BMW has a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" whitch means the car can handle driving funtions at speeds up to 25 mph. What if the car was to stop working and keep going and not being able to stop? what would happen ? Nothing good would. GM has developed driver's seats to vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. What if you trust this vibrator and you wait till it vibrates to stop backing up and the vibrator fails and you hit something? that could be dangerous. You could back into a kid or person and run them over. You could also hit an object and damage your car. That's why i am stating my opinion on why i am against the development of these cars. We should stay with what we have until we are 100% sure about things. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
12C8131C5758,"My thought on drivless cars is that they can be a help but then again they could cause promblems.

I think driveless cars can help because it could help do things a lot faster, and help a lot with other things. It has some good thing like warning you, help on gas miliage, and drive it self. you really wont have to drive ou just sit and let the car take you by it self.

i think it will make promblems because you wont need alot of gass and if u dont need gas no one will make anymoney because you wont need all of it and there will be alot of oil in the ground beacuse no one is bringing it up because no ones needs it to make gas because of these new cars dont need a lot of gas. It will make more promblems because you dont have to drive the car will drive for you and if the car is driving for you and all you do is sit you will forget how to drive and if something happens and you have to take over you will not know because you forgot how to drive beacuse you sit for so long and let the car drive it self.

My thought on driveless cars can be both prostive and negitive. i think more on the negitive because more people will not have jobs that you have to drive because you dont have to drive because you have a car thaat will drive for u. so i think it can be a good thing that we have them but at the same time a bad thing to.

718D01BE7367,"Who doesn't like the idea of sitting back, sipping on your coffee while reading the paper as your car whisk you to your destination? Sadly, as wonderful as it may sound, that is not the case with ""Driverless Cars."" Driverless cars are not really a grand idea as they may seem because even though they say that they are driverless and are suppose to be safe, you must always be alert when driving them, there is a chance that the car maybe unsafe, and without a doubt, they are more than likely going to be expensive.

These suppose driveless cars are said to only handle driving functions at speeds up to twenty-five mph, but it carries sensors that make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel. And although the car is designed to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake for themselves, it is designed to notify the driver when it requires human skills on a road ahead. Which then require the driver of this ""driverless car"" to be alert at all times and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. This makes the term driverless car pointless.

Having to always be alert while being in a driverless car isn't the worst thing in the world and it isn't the only thing that people have to worry about. In many states they have banned the use of computer driven cars because they believe that humans are the only safe drivers. Although in many cases this may not be true, a human driver seems more truthworthy than a computer that may or may not short circut at any moment. Humans seem to be more reliable but if people ever see to change their minds and laws change, it will still come down to one question as stated in the text, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?

Other than these cars being unsafe, what most people seem to not realize is that these cars are going to probably cost them an arm and a leg. Seeing as how these smarter cars are suppose to be smarter and more high tech. Which leads to the next question, what makes a ""smarter car"" smarter? Well according to the passage Google had modified a car to use position estimating sensors on a left rear whieel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, an intertial motion sensor, and a dubbed LIDAR, not including the things inside the car. This all sounds like materials that cost quite a bit of cash and as time progresses and technology improves, so will the sensors and as things get better, the preformence will go up but so will the value, making the car more expensive to make.

Ultimately, these smarter, driverless cars, don't seem so smart or so driverless because they still require a driver to be alert, they don't seem so safe, and they will probably cost a ton of money. So they require a drivers assistance everytime it can't do anything on its own, making the name driverless car pointless. Another human being would seem more trutworthy behind the wheel than a computer. Then lastly they probbaly cost more than a colege students yearly tuition. Need there be more said about why driverless cars are just a bad idea? ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
09FF4F0D2B79,"Control your life or let it control you. Since technology has improved significantly since the past decades, In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" humans are able to create vehicles that drive themselves. They have their pros and cons but the cons out-shape the pros. Driveless cars are lethal, illegal, and time consuming to manufacture.

The first reason on why driveless cars are lethal is that they are not tested fully and can injure the driver very severely if not handled right. This is evident in paragraph 9 where the author states, ""manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe."" This is a perfect example of how the driveless cars are still unstable and should be tested. Overall, companies still need to improve on some aspects on the driveless car to have it be a safe to use.

The second reason is that the utilization of driveless cars on testing is illegal. Evidence to support this claim is that the author states in paragraph 9, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" This makes the invention difficult to find it's short comings and hard to sell. More evidence is found that alot of people can get in trouble due to this technology failing, which is found in paragraph nine again, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This can both harm them because of the injury and the company's reputation. Overall, driveless cars are suited to test because of the law.

Finally, the last reasoning on while driveless cars are suited for the market is because of time. It takes a long time to produce; this is stated by the author in paragraph 5, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" It takes the company TEN YEARS to only create one component of the device. Overall, driveless cars take a long time to produce.

Driveless cars can be conducive and negative to the consumer but the draw backs out match the pros with its dangerous to control, legalization, and time consuming process to manufacture. The technology is not ready yet for this device to hit shelves in markets and is best to wait when there is more money involved for this project.  ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B64B9CDA1E54,"I think having driverless cars is a great idea. I support it alot because it will make road trips very easier and more exciting for the driver. If taking a long road trip, the driver will be able to sleep as well as the passengers. But the con about that, is that the driver might have issues trusting the driverless car. If the driver dont trust the car, he/she might stay awake as the car have a long trip to where ever the destination is located. Another con will be how might the driverless car react upon other driverless cars. Will the sensors be too hype from every car causing a traffic jam, slow traffic, or maybe an accident. Thats why i also support the driverless cars to let the driver take control at certain points while driving. Eventhough the driver would have to still keep watch of the rode, thats what he or she have to do anyway. So as of right now, ill just say that driverless cars would be good for drivers who like to text while driving and maybe talking on the phone while driving. That is what i think about driverless cars untill they can approve the use of the cars to sleep in while driving.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Our everyday lives have been simplified from machines that have been designed to do our work for us. Something people use everyday are cars. So, is advancing cars the next step for improvement or will it be best kept as an idea?

Driverless cars has both pros and cons, but overall will do more harm than good. Car wrecks are very common and can happen to anyone. If we drive our cars by ourselves we feel as if we have more power or control over the car and its actions. A car designed to do the driving for you could be helpful in some ways, but would you want to put your all of your trust into a machine that has the power to take your life? Just like our cellphones and other everyday devices, they mess up. Failure in technology will always occur no matter how nice the product or idea might be. Although driverless cars will not fully be completly driverless. You still can have the ability to take over the driving, but then what is the point? People have been driving cars for years and years. It is better to not fix what is broken, than to adapt to a different lifesyle.

In conclusion, the future may be rising, but sometimes it is better to leave things the way they are. As time goes on, more advances will be added to cars to enchance the way we drive. Until then, a car needs its driver.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

A car that would go the speedyou would tell it to go and let you sit back relax and let you enjoy yourself. Although i have always wanted one in the future,I realize that they are very dangerous and require a lot of cooperation at some times

The driverless cars could make a great impact on society if people started to obtain them. They use much less gas and not give off as much pollution. For example, the first paragraph states ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" But although i see the many pros that come with the driverless cars, i aslo see the cons. Paragrap seven states ""This means the juman driver must remain alert and be ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. The quote shows that although the cars are technically driverless, if they get in a complicated situation that they can not handle themselves, then the driver must be able to quickly react to change the situation. This would lead to lots of dangerous accidents. For example if the driver falls asleep and the car needs the humans help, the human may not be able to wake up in time befor the problem occurs. Also im guessing that the car would not have much time to alert the driver before a problem or accident occurs. One last thing that is bad about these cars are that if they get into an accident then the driver is fully responsible for them. Why should the non driver be blamed for the vars theat are suppose to be ""driverless.""

Driverless cars can bring many new things to us such as lower gas milage and less polution but overall, the driverless cars are not needed and can cause many problems. The car can get into accidents that humans are not responsible for and require a lot of human assistance which really would make the car ""driverless.""So if the problems could be fixed with the current condition of driverless cars then i would be happy to see them on the road, but until then I think it is much better to use the same cars that we have been using for years.

6D68DBB7AC32,"In the article, the author does present a lot of postitives and negative aspects of driverless cars. In my opinion, i am for the development of these cars. technology keeps growing and spreading wider each day. In the article it says how these cars are already on the way of being developed, Goolgle has had cars that could drive indepedently, but only under certain conditions. Googles cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash, so you know that the ""Driverless Cars"" will be safe.

I personally think that these cars would benifit people and the world in many ways. Gooogle cofounder Sergey Brin says that the cars he foresees would use half of the fuel of todays taxis and that it could offer way more flexibility then a bus, these cars would fundamentally change the world. Plus driving would be at at a way lower risk of car accidents, because it is a smart computer telling the car what to do. The ""driverless cars"" have already made alot of progress and alt of diffrent companies are trying to make these, as safe and as fast as possible.

The company BMW announced the develpoment of the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013. The car can Brake, steer, and accelerate all by themselves. The person in the car has to have his or her hands on the wheel at all times because they are not made completly driverless yet, but they are getting more advanced every year, and i believe that someday driverless things will be a thing, and i hope it is. More lives will be safe. Less gas will be used so its better for our enviroment. If people are angry or have had to much to drink they can get home safley and with out an accident.

I can imagine a future where no one buys cars. Many manufacturers are already working towards this pursuit. They are developing vehicles that operate with very little human input. Various sensors are used to assist the cars in reaching their destinations. These vehicles can operate as public transportation and allow for very efficient travel. I believe autonomous cars will become a thing of the future because they will make driving safer and less tedious.

Safety is a huge concern in almost all aspects of life. With driverless cars, accidents will become a thing of the past. Since 2009, cars developed by Google have been able to drive more than half a million miles without a single crash. They only require human input during traffic issues, which will become nonexistent. If all cars were driverless, none of them would crash or cause otherwise perilous situations requiring human input. There will no longer be any injuries caused by automobiles in the future.

The current state of driving is very wasteful. Both the earth's resources and the driver's time are needlessly wasted. Sergey Brin has predicted driverless cars will use half the fuel of today's cars. This will have a huge impact on saving the environment by causing less pollution and removing the need to create as many dangerous oil rigs. The passage states that heads-up displays are a possibility in the future. These allow the person who would have been driving to do something productive. Instead of a long commute spent staring aimlessly at the road, a worker could finish a decent portion of his or her daily work in the time spent travelling to the workplace. Autonomous cars open up a huge new world of efficiency for everyone.

Critics of the concept believe computer-ran vehicles can reach nowhere near the skill or safety of human-ran vehicles. This is simply just not the case. Autonomous cars have been proven to get in very few accidents. They are equipped with sensors all over, giving them vision far beyond human eyesight. If all cars became autonomous, they would be able to communicate with one another on the road, removing dangers due to lack of communication we currently see in human drivers.

Driverless cars are a huge and vital step towards safety and efficiency. They benefit all aspects of human life, not just the road. Being able to reach destinations sooner allows for more productivity and easier human contact. For these reason, I believe autonomous vehicles will definitely become widespread in the future. With how far companies such as Google have made it in the race to build driverless cars, it would be insane to try to imagine a future without them.      ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
54DEEF555082,"The advancing of technology is unstoppable. When the driverless car is fully driverless, it will be revolutionary. That's why I believe that driverless cars are a great thing that will be fully added to our world one day. The driverless car could benefit the people of this world in many ways, it conserves gas, it's more safe than other ways of transportation, and it would cost less.

One very important thing about the driverless car is that it conserves gas. The world is already in a mild gas problem as oil is a nonrenewable resource. This is because the people of the world use way too much gas every day for driving. These cars would use half the fuel that cars today use. That would make the price of gas go down and it would help our gas problem and make gas last for many more years.

Driverless cars will be extermently safer than the cars we have today. I say this because it would cause less accidents. Let's say that someone had a little bit too much to drink but he or she is still alert enough to drive. Instead of taking the risk of crashing, he or she can get into the driverless car and only control it at a few moments. There would be a way less chance of he or she crashing and would make the roads way safer for every one else.

The driverless car will save many families a ton of money. Instead of families buying their own car, they can call a Google driverless taxi when they need to go somewhere and not have to worry about the cost of gas. They also wouldn't have to worry about the price of buying a new car. The only places that would be losing money out of this is car dealerships. When the driverless cars become mainstream there wont be much need for car dealerships or even man driven cars.

Driverless cars are going to be one of the biggest inventions in human history once they break their way into the mainstream. They would help out the world in many ways by conserving gas, making the world a safer place, and it would save familes a ton of money.

90EE6A7C4D27,"Somethings that I have observed is that when taking long trips by ground vehicles often times the driver will get tired of driving so they put their vehicle in cruise mode, now that is a nice aspect to the vehicle. Taking it one step further so that the vehicle can steer, accelerate, brake themsleves, and alert the driver to take over when nearby problems occur such as navigating through work zones and around accidents now that is even cooler. Like the article says the system has a warning system so that the seat vibrates or a light on the windshield flashes to warn of problems that are nearby. Now that sounds great but there should be even more safety like the article says installing a camera so that the vehicle is watching the driver while the driver watches the road. I am all for the driverless vehicle but some factors are necessary to take in terms of safety.

The vehicle may have a warning system which is great, but what if the warning system fails to warn. I get that there are complications that can occur such as the driver less system failing to work properly. When accidents do happen like this whose to blame is it the driver or the manufacturer. If say a mother has her children with her and the system fails and crashes does the driver have the ability to sue the manufacturer. Now if something like this does happen and it goes out to the public how many people are going to purchase the vehicle.

Is a driverless car really a good idea? Manufacturing a driverless car has not even been a succeding task. Cars that can drive on their own still require an alert driver at times. If the self driving car was manufactured laws would have to be changed, the company and the owner would have issues if a crash did accure, and the owner possibly needed to be alert may not stay alert. The self driving car needs more time before being tried out with actual costumers.

The driverless car manufactured by google has made it half a million miles without a crash. However drivers still are alerted to take over the wheel when parking, navigating traffic, or road construction. What could happen if a ""driverless"" car alerted the owner but they weren't alert and did't take they wheel in time? Major accidents could be caused from this. A driver not focused on the road could put in danger themselves and other drivers around them.

If the driver was'nt alert and an accident did accure, both the company and owner would be in seriouse trouble. Certian laws would have to be made or changed to solve this issue. If there was a crash with two cars would one of the drivers be of blame as they are now or would both companies be blamed. Technology has instences when it doesn't work. Everyone has yelled at a phone or T.V before. Though when that technology doesn't work properly it's not a life or death situatiuon. Also how expensive would this be? It's well known how expensive a phone, T.V, or new computer can be. It would be too expensive to make them the sale price would have to bring back the money spent to manufacture one and the sales person would need money to actually make for the work. How many people could ctually afford it. The people it would help most likely can't even come up with the money to get one.

With the rate of accidents now drivers barely stay alert when they have the wheel. But knowing, or thinking, they have the freedom to do as they please while the car drives itself they will lose focus. Drivers won't pay attention to the road. People have way to much trust in their technology they wont even think of what would happen when they have to drive. How owuld they react if they tried to take a nap and was awaken to take the wheel? they may not have enough time to even think of what they need to do to avoid an accident.

What would be the point of a driverless car? Reduce the number of drunk drivers on the road maybe. Or give people who can't drive the transportation they need without public transports. This would all be great! But what would happen when the car needed them to take over. Of course you'd still need to go through training and so on to get your liscnes so people who have the inability to drive may it be physical will have no prevail in it. Also if a drunk driver was alerted they would still be driving after drinking. The only ones that coul use this technology are the ones that can already drive.

Driverless cars, yes it would be nice to have but are they really safe as they say they are.

In paragraph 9 it states ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good question. Who is at fault? It depends on the situation. If the driver was too careless to pay attention it could possibly be the drivers fault, but what could have caused the driverless car to not work as properly.

In paragraph 9 it states that ""if traiffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" Yes, what if there are new traffic laws added. How would the auto piloted car know if something has changed or not. It's good how car manufacturers implemented the fact that a driver can take over if something were to happen.

Who would be responsible for crashes? Will they be as safe as regullar vehicles? Will they be able to be hacked? Even though the autonimous car is possible is it really safe?

First, how would autonimous vehicles respond to a wreck? It is clearly stated in paragraph 7 ""but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". So what happens in the event of a crash? One car wrecks and it causes a huge domino effect. One car after another, pile up because they do not know how to deal with the situation.

Second, in the event of a wreck who is responsible? The owner of the vehicle or the manufacturer? While the vehicle does belong to the owner and he did know about potential problems, the manufacturer should be able to deliver a completely safe vehicle to a customer.

That brings me to another issue. No one can confrim 100% that an autonimous vehicle will not wreck. There wil alway be human error in the manufactoring process. Now you might say; but they will be assembled by robots, so there wont be any human error. Well: who assembled the robots, who programmed them?

Another thing to be worried about is terrorism. Will these cars be able to be hacked? A terrorist could hack into an autonimous vehicle and use for whatever he desires. He could drive a bomb anywhere he wants. No place would be safe or out of rech of a terrorist.

The futuristic automobiles could revolutionize the country. Drivereless cars are a fantastic idea, and could create several benifits for the country.

Driverless cars have the potentiol to drastically reduce fuel usage. In the opening paragraph of the article, the author states, ""the cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" Less fuel used for automobiles would empower the United States to spend less money on oil and natural gas imports. Additionally, less fuel polution released by cars would help make the enviroment a safer place for current and future generations.

In the article, the author talks about the use of GPS and sensors used in the cars. Relying on computers to transport us is a much safer alternative compared to the current option. The driverless cars, that are largely computer powered, leave very little room for human error, which would drastically reduce the number of automobile accidents.

Oppontens of driverless cars may argue that these cars are not safe in the event of unforseen circumstances, such as accidents or road problems. However, driverless cars, as stated in the article, ""are designed to to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill."" Thus, in an emergancy situation, the driver can take over the car can advance past the situation and continue to move along without any issue.

In conclusion, driverless cars could be the best thing to happen to automobiles since automobiles were invented.

Driverless cars would have more faults than benefits to the road.

People just want to upgrade everything without seeing the faults in evolving. For example, the car still needs a driver to manage it, so why do you need to upgrade if it doesn't even fulfill its own namesake? The limited automotive use really just puts the driver at more risk, because of the possibility of a malfunction. On that note since the cars are lined with high tech equipment, and whatnot wouldn't the accident in that kind of vehicle be more severe? Something could explode, and injure much more than the drivers. This also would make one of these cars far more difficult to replace as it states in the article. With it being filled with sensors, and other high tech equipment this could lead to 100's of thousands of dollars being thrown out the window for repairs.

I feel like having smater cars is nice but at the same time its not. Have you thought of, what if the car doesnt funtion the way its suppose to and it causes an acident. Also what if you command it to take you some where and it gets you lost. What if the police tries to pull you over and the car doesnt stop.

Im going to talk on why driveing less is bad. Well for 1 reason when you are kind of stress you can go out for a drive to distract yourself for a little. Also if we wont be able to drive as much people won't like that because they like to control the car while driving. Also like if you want to take somone on a date it wont be as romantic as if it is for you to drive.

Im going to talk how it wont work for part of the world sensing the world. First of all some people are poor and they wont be able to afford a smart car. Second of all there's people the like to be able to control the car rather than driveing less. Also its very expensive for the people to put new roads and that means the taxes are going to be higher.

In conclusion i think we should stick to normal cars. Its to much money to do all that. Also its going to be a waist of time if it doesnt work and a waist of money. I feel like we should be able to control the car because you dont know what can happen. Also its a way to get out of the house if your stressed . Also not every one will be able to get a smart car.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
EFCF81F38226,"Driverless cars, am I for or against the idea of them? I am against the thought of driverless cars for two main reasons. One, drunk drivers and two, kids using the cars.

Technology has been becoming more advanced over the years from phones all the way up to cars now. In paragraph four lines one through two says, ""Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars.""

Smarter cars are not going to make the world safer because not everyone will be able to afford the new ""smart car"". These new ""smart cars"" will probably be hybrids running on electricity instead of gas. Which will make gas prices for normal cars sky rocket.

Now thinking of driving safely that means no drinking, texting, or sometimes even eating. With these driverless cars more than likely people will go out to drink and take there driverless car with them thinking it will still be safe to drive even though they have been drinking. Just because the car drives by its self you still have to hold the wheel. ""special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" paragraph seven line three. Thinking of safety also includes the protection of kids. Teens will think that it's okay to take their parents driverless car because all they will have to do is hold the wheel which is wrong because in paragraph seven lines six through eight reads ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" In conclusion the driverless car would not be safe for this generation. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
37E0CC5A4DFA,"Driverless cars are not in the best interest for humans. People like to be in control. Men and women won't want to give up their freedom of driving their own vehicles. The feeling of being proud to drive yourself around will over power the easiness of having a car, just drive you.

Driverless cars are not even close to being ready, some can only go up to 25 mph. With highways and freeways a 25 mph car serves no purpose. The article states, ""... but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. If you have to hold on to the wheel, then you might as well drive yourself.

Now, with the popularity of driverless cars growning, some states have outloud the driverless cars. ""In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" Being able to drive from state to state is a great privilage in the United States. Having a driverless car would only be good for a state that aloud it. Vacations across the Us would become much more difficult, if you weren't even aloud to ""drive"" your own car.

Finally, Computers have been gettign hacked sense the first one was invented. A hacker hacks it, the computer malfunctions and all files are erased or it acts on terms that you can not control. Driverless vechicles run on a computer based system. It only takes one terrorist or criminal to figure out how to hack it and crashes could occur within a push of a button. But, these cars could be useful to get a good nap in, or rest so someone isn't tired and driving. They could also help out with drunk driving. The only problem is, that there are to many difficulties that come with these new products and they will never be in the peoples good interest if they are not solved.

This also would be a lot more flexable than a bus because, the driverless cars could take us to our exact destination. Plus the driverless car idea would use half of the amount of fuel we use today.

The struggle we face on saving up to buy a car would not be a problem to us anymore. Multiple teens who already stress because of school have to also handle a job on top of that just to buy a car. Some even have to give up activities they love because of their jobs. Adults spend thousands of dollars just to buy cars and then have the risk of having to spend even more money when they break down to repair them. Cars are expensive items and the money we spend on them could go to other things like vacations, bills, and food.

Buses today have a certain route they follow on a daily basis. They are only capable of taking you to the closest bus stop to your desired location, this could still be a mile walk away from your destination. With driverless cars it would serve to you more as a taxi that takes you where you want to go. This saves us a lot of time because if you are late for the bus and have to wait on the next one or you still have a long walk even after you are dropped off.

The polution fuel causes would decrease by 50%. The driverless cars are projected to use only half the amount of fuel cars and buses are usuing today. This makes earth a lot healthier and safer to live on for you and your family.

2DBFE64834A2,"I am strongly against driverless cars. I feel that whoever came up with the idea must have had some bad food or something. I wonder what encouraged them to even have the thought of a car driving itself. Having driverless cars will most likely end the human population. I am saying this because it makes me think of the movie Wall-e.

In the movie Wall-e there is a robot named Wall-e and earth is deserted or so wall-e thinks. One day Wall-e was doing his normal routine when he stumbled upon a pretty robot named Eve. Wall-e and Eve go on a journey to find her home/ ship, and when they do it is filled with humans. Wall-e is suprised to see the humans he thought they all were dead. Every human that he sees is sitting in a chair that can move them aournd to where ever they want, and get them whatever they want. They don have to get up for anything or physically move their musles. All of the people are obese. People die from obesity, obesity can cause heart problems which can cause a heart attack. Which can make you die. This is only a chair, imagine what it would be like if it was a car.

It would be pointless for adults and teenagers to get lisence. It would be pointless to have rules of the road. Everything that has restriictions, or policies on drivers and their driving would be pointless and useless. As of now we our try to stop drinking and driving. If a car drove itself few crashes but the number lives that are taken will be the same. Peopel can die from alcohol poisoning. Even now cars have malfunctions, what if the driverless car runs into another car because it couldnt stop. A few years ago a lady was on the interstate and her breaks weren't working. The emergency break wasn't even working, and she was going aroung 70 miles per hour. She only had control over the steering wheel. People wont have control over the steering wheel of the driverless car descides to malfunction. Many lives could be taken because of it. This is why i am against driverless cars.

F6BDEF0143F4,"I think drivless cars are great to our future, Having to hold onto the steering wheel while driving this car is accurate , the safety in this car should be built great if not better than a automatic car we drive everyday. This car is a serious and deadly situation , you have a car driving you around and you are not doing just about anything. This idea would benefit alot of drivers for the future , espcially older people that do not long to put there life in danger nor others.

The greatest of our future is evolving with new things as in this car. It will be half the price for gas because it will only be like half a tank price as now days. Genreal motors has a made a test track and it seems to be doing great. In order for this smart car stuff to happen though we will need smarter roads to deal with instead of the roads we have today. These cars will be built and ready for your safety.

The driveless cars will have a video camera mounted on the rear wheel which is safety right there. These cars will have a lot of sensors as in for safety. But today the word is all about safety just image the future as in how much safety will be a concern. For the General motors to come up with such a smart idea we should take this idea and see how great it is. This future car should stop car accidents also. Not to sure on how the car will do on ice or other probiems but im sure General motors will figure this out and get the show on the road.

D485BE90E01E,"It just seems like yeasterday that technogoly was interdouce to our culture, from the telephone, to the probabily the most useful thing in out daily life, cars. For decades companies have been trying to perfect the whole idea of car from hybrids, to eletric power cars. But now the next big think coming from our generation is driverless cars oming from companies like google. Already other compaines are building driverless cars and sayign they'll be release by 2016. But I know if they carry out on that idea fro that release, its going to be a disaster in every way possible, here's why.

Before we I go into the mees that is driverless cars, what I can say is a great system that was added was a combination of still having the driver in the drivers seat with his hands on the wheel, and being able to perfect a error thats happen in the progam of the car. Becuase at the end of the day, technogoly was made by fulad people and will make tech fulad no matter what. But the compaines are praising this as if nothing is going to go wrong. The stats do show barley any crashes occur, but the one problem is were not talking about mutiple people having one by just one car in a certain area.

Lets say its 2020 right now, and everyone has a driverless car. You go cars from different companies and all running at different severs from that compainies. How are two different branded vehicles are going to react to each other with hundreads of cars running at the same time, the sever is going to crash. Althought a situation like this might not ever occur, theres more problems that still ned to be speak of the driverless cars.

Every if this was never a problem in the first place, in this future there going to be people with vehicles that still need to be manualy driver, and vehicles that are driverless. What the problem is in the situation is when reading the text, these driverless cars hit a max of 25mph. Althought these cars will most likely be block of on going on hight ways, just on mains roads this is going to cause alot of road rage to certain. just for these car only going 25mph, soem people are going to be block off from going to their destation right on time.

So it seems driverless car are going to cause any more problem unless states outlaw car that arn't driverless to the public, but that would just be a stupid idea and would just make a problem all by itself. But in many ways that's what companies are think to do, make a system that would be too complex for anyone to understand. Changing the basic law of roads is what companies are thinking about. This would elemate many people do to the major change in the system. Most likely people would have no choice and be forced to buy a driverless car under their will.

This whole situation of saying this is going to be the next big thing is somthing we've seen before every decade. If I had to piredict what would happen if driverless cars do release in 2020. Pretty much any new like this is going to have problems now just becuase these cars now need to be quickly made which can lead someone to question the quality of these car. Not to mention the poor millage these cars will have, and pretty much these cars are going to be over price and not worth the vaule at all. The trend of these driverless cars might died around the mid 2020s and will have to wait until the tech is perfective to be re-release to the public. In a nutshell, theres going to be some major flaws with these types of vehicles if release in 2020. All you can do is don't buy then right as they come out, becuase I wouldn't be surprise if the next days theres numerous of crashes in the coming days.         ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F9D68CC43263,"People are getting smarter and technology is getting more advanced. One of those technology is the driverless cars. The development of this is a bright idea. This will change the world in a positive way. The vehicles will come in handy and will be useful for multiple situations. It would decrease the amount of accidents there are by a huge amount. The driver can make the choice, whether they want to drive or for the vehicle to do the job.

These automobiles will have tons of sensors. Before the year 2000, it was hard to turn these ideas into reality. The author said, ""the sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there."" But, it is now the year 2016 and the world has developed and changed. Making these cars wouldn't be too hard of a work.

Driverless cars would mean less accidents. One of the top cause of accidents occur while people text while driving. If they do develop these cars, this wouldn't happen anymore because the automobile would do the job for them. So, they'll be able to send messages and do whatever, whenever. This plan includes a lot of safety for people in the car and out of the car.

Also, drivers have more than just one choice. Even though the car itself can do the steering, accelerating, and braking for the human, the human can just turn on the in-car system and drive. This system exists to entertain the drivers. There are people out there who just drive for the fun of it, so why not include this option along? This can be turned on and off instantly according to what the driver wants.

In conclusion, if people want to increase the population of the world, they would to agree to this plan. Driverless cars would make the earth a safer place for every human being. The car is in control of itself. There are many sensors to warn for cautions and dangers. Automakers want to make these cars that only exist in movies to come true for a good reason. Also, it's not like people will never drive again. There are choices. The driverless cars would make a great amount of difference.

A82574587C82,"in the article ""driverless cars are coming"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars and that means im against the development of these cars because there are so many negative aspects and not a lot of positive aspects which mean that the driverless car is not that safe. some of the positive aspects of driverless cars are: 1. googles cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. 2. within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. 3. the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowinging far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. some of the negative aspects of driverless cars are: 1. these smart-roads systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to exisiting roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical. 2. the sensors werent there, the computers werent there, and the mapping wasnt there. radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. 3. presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. as a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. this is why im against the development of driverless cars because they arent that safe unless they have a human driver in the driverless cars at all times. the driverless cars would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus but the cars would still need a human driver to have control at all times. the driverless cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents, but so far, google cars arent truly driverless. without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? for starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors. googles modified toyota prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a gps receiver, and an inertial montion sensor. the most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. the combination of all this input is necessart for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own. it costs a lot of money to make driverless cars actually driverless.. they have to spend two hundred million dollars on a radar that is on top of a hill. the car can handle driving funstions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. in fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselver, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready yo take over when the situation requires.",1,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Youre not just going to want to just sit there akwardly and do nothing while your car does all the work. Many people are going to think that this is a great idea till they start to understand the actually danger it puts you in. Driveless cars need to be put to a stop before many people become injured.

This is a horrible idea. Why would someone start to put many lives in danger? All they are doing is basically saying you just have to sit there and let the car do the work. What happens to the people if they accidently fall asleep because they're not doing anything? They're going to die or get seriously hurt.

You have to be alert at all times because the car cant make it through a traffic jam or any other roadblocks.

in conclusion, the driveless care wouldnt be a smart idea. It could end badly for both the person who buys it and the company who sold it.

the cars wouldnt be driving themselves, they would only do simple tasks. such as, steer, accelerate, and brake. humans can do all of that, and more, just fine. the cars ""heads up display"" can work miracles. yet, if the driver isnt paying any attention to them, then the whole thought goes down the drain.

if one of these ""smart cars"" where to get in a road accedent, would it be the manufacturers or the drivers fault. i beileve that it would be the manufacterers fault. if the car has a faulty sytem. then there may be more danger in these cars, than any good.

A3C3844D53EB,"How do you feel about driverless cars? What do you think theyll be like for you in the future? Are they better than cars that have to be personally operated by the human? Well, they named a few good and a few bad things that would come with the driverless car. They told how you will still have to keep focus on the road in the driverless car because it will need to be hand driven when it comes to work roads and accidents that have happened or even traffic jams. THe good things they said about it would probably be, that it is sensored so you dont hit nothing or it tells you when something is wrong and where your far is at and how its driving itself.

The things that are good about the driverless car would be, it could drive itself, you could relax and chill while its taking you where you need to go. Also, its good because it has all these sensors in the car that it can tell when to brake, or when to slow down. This could be a good thing kind of , when it is driving itself you should always be prepared to take over. But it said in the article "" While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" So if they ever got into a car accident they could probably go back and look at the cameras too see what the driver was doing and how they crashed.

The things that are bad could be that whenever the car wants to go down the company could shut your engine off at any tme and at any place. Whether its still driverless or not you still have to pay attention so you might as well just stick with the divers car. the other bad thing could be your car can decide when to brake and that could be at any point and you could brake at the wrong time and someone could hit you. One bad thing that could also be good is the sensors , sometimes they could go out and your car could start messing up.

In my opinion i think driver cars are better because there is so much that could go wrong with the driverless car. Like the car going out and the sensors messing up and you just break down and you wouldnt know how else to fix it, because it has so much technology. But with driver cars you can know when there is a porblem, you know when and where you need to fix things under the hood or on the car in general. The driver cars are better i hink because the person in the car should always have their eyes on the road. If we have driverless cars what was the point in the drivers licence and permit if the cars will drive us? you know ?

With a drivers car where you have a person driving 24/7 you know how to operate the car. You know how to change the oil or how to change the breaks so they dont go out and you get in a wreck. I mean yeah you could do something wrong with the car and it mess up but im sure if you're working on a car you have done it before. But drivers cars you dont have to worry about the engine reducing power on you, you just fill the car with gas and your good. But driver ccars you gotta worry about the car breaking down etc.

But there are always to fix your broken down car unlike you can with driverless cars.

So if i had to choose any car whther it was drivers or dirverless, I think i would go with the drivers car. Because , for the fact i know i could trust the car and i could have the car checked to see if its good for running and driving unlike you could with the driverless car. The driverless car could be good for so long then something bad could happen and you not know what was wrong with it. So if i had to get a car of my choice between drivers and driverless i would most definitely choose drivers. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BECA14914CFB,"In my opinion, driverless cars are a good idea. Having driverless cars can help us in many ways, including preventing crashes, and increased safety. However, driverless cars can also hinder us because technology can always fail, which could have catastrophic consequences.

Firstly, numerous crashes can be prevented. General Motors once created a concept car that ran on a track, therefore creating smarter roads instead of smarter drivers. The only forseeable problem with this is that it would be extremely expensive to redo all of the roads in the country. Another way that crashes can be provented is by improved sensors. Google modified a Toyota Prius with many new sensors, the most important being a spinning 3-D sensor on the roof that scans the surrounding area to see the road conditions. This scanner can inform you if a car is coming at you way to fast and inform you if you need to sspeed up or slow down, or it can have the car do it for you. Both of these are adequate reasons to standardize driverless cars.

Another reason that driverless cars are a good idea is that they improve people's safety. As previously mentioed, the improved sensors will increase safety. There are all kinds of sensors that sense all different things such as the 3-D sensor, position estimating sensors, GPS reciever, and many more. all of these sensors can tell you if you're to close to the edge of the road, if you have a caar in your blindspot, if you're driving to fast, or to slow, the road conditions, and many other things. All of these sensors are so helpful in informing your car upon what to do to keep you and your family safe. Also, driverless cars take away distracted driving. Recently, a friend of mine recieved a text, picked up his phone to reply, and ran over a trash can. Imagine if that trash can had been a child, or a car containing you and your children. If he had a driverless car, then he would not have hit that trash can, in fact he would never run over anything again. Having driverless cars would infrease the safety factor for everyone.

On the other hand, having driverless cars could be a bad thing. Technology could fail, leaving a catastrophic mess in its wake. The GPS system could misjudge a distance, causing the car to turn to soon, and run headlong into a building, killing people inside. Another thing is that the self-driving system could fail all together, leaving someone who doesn't know how to drive eiter stranded, or having to drive themselves. Therefore, driverless cars could be a bad thing.

In essence, driverless cars can be both good and bad for mankind. They can reduce the liklihood of crashing, and increase safety, but the technology can fail, and harm many people.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A20FCA71F224,"My thoughts on driverless cars are not necessarily against it but I think the world can do without for awhile still, in other words there's no rush to get them out into the public streets. Although it would be very luxurious to have a car the drives itself, the safety issues & tedious appliances still need much work. Google has had driverless cars since 2009 that drove more than half a million miles without crashing but these cars still require human occupation in complicated traffic situations & driveways. I think the smart road system working in hand with the driverless cars would be more efficient but too expensive & requires ""massive"" upgrades to the roads so the idea was disgarded. So being that the smart cars would be driving on the roads we know of now it would need a pretty excessive amount of sensors to mimic the skill of a human behind the wheel. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating senor on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, & the LIDAR on the roof that uses laser beams to project a 3D image of the car's surroundings. This is all so that in can mimic human driving ability as closely as possible & there's still much work to be done. BMW's development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013 was the 'better way' to go about having 'driverless' cars. This car was designed to drive itself standardly & notify the human driver inside when he or she needs to take over the wheel. Some might argue that having a driverless car that still needs you to drive is pointless so the ideas of in-car entertainment & information systems are going around. The ideas of these cars definitely are revolved around luxury & safety but new traffic laws would have to be made for these automobiles driving themselves because if an accident happens who is to blame? I believe there is still more troubleshooting to be as far as having a driverless car on the streets. Most states have even made it illegal to test computer-driven cars with the exception of California, Nevada, Florida, & the District of Columbia who allow limited use of semi-autonomous cars. After these cars are proved to be safe overall, then they will be introduced into the public streets. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
8B3961172163,"I think that it would be a good idea to make driverless cars. I am going to tell you a few reasons why I think it would be a good idea. It would be ""Sensing the World."" It has its own way of drving. It could assist you in many ways. These are the three reasons now in the next three paragraphs I am going to give you a few deatils on each one.

The first reason is sensing the world. Google modified Toytoa Prius uses postioin-estimating senors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor, a video mounterd near the rear view mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an intertial motor sensor. These sensors make it much easier to drive by itself. If it can do it by itself then it won't meed the human to do it for it. The most important bit of technology would be the spinning sensor on the roof. It shows you a 3-D model if the vehicles surroundings. The combination of all of these accessories would show how the car could be driverless.

The second reasoning is it has its own way of driving. The car could handle driving up to 25 mph, but certain driving functions makes sure that the driver keeps their hands on the wheel. They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themselves they notify when the driver needs to put their hands back on the wheel.

The last reasoning is it could assist you in many ways. There is a car lest the driver know when they need to take over the driving when they are in certain areas, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The human driver must stay alert at all times. The car has a vibrating seat that lets the driver know if they are about to back into something. The manufatuers are thinking about putting cameras in the car to watch the drivers and make sure they are focused on the road.

Those are my reasoning on why I think the Driverless cars would be a good idea. My three ideas were ""Sensing the

Someone may have a child on board and they might need a diaper change or they need something, well you can help your child while your car drives for you. Say you're about to crash and your driverless car saves you with the sensors it has. There are some good reasons to have a driverless car as well.

In conclusion driverless cars is a no for me but there is also good reasons. Such as a hacker, hacking your car ans making you crash and ending up in the hosptial. There is a good reason too is for when you're in accidents. Last is the joy of learning and driving a car. This is why I am against driverless cars.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A9D54990F59F,"Driverless cars often seem like an abstract achievement that man has made that allows for drivers to be reckless and lazy. Many people believe that when a crisis may occur, people will be too lazy to take control of the situation and avoid tragedy, resulting in injury or even death. Or, they can even argue that driverless cars may seem like the world will begin to rely on technology. But, this is not the case. Driverless cars will hold a positive effect on the upcoming future because the cars could make up a very flexible bus or taxi system, only use half of the fuel that is used today, and allow far better response and control than a human driver.

If in the future there are driverless and self-managing bus systems, there will be much less need or demand for every person to have their own car and this could save many families a lot of money. Buying cars can be a very tough ordeal for families that have a hard time affording the lives that they live, and by creating a standard bus system, there will be less of a hassle for these families. Also, if the bus and taxi systems are standardized, the busses will all come and depart on a schedule, causing the busses to be more on time and more efficient than having humans drive.

Secondly, if there were a large increase in the stadard bus and taxi systems, the usage of gas and oil will drop substantially. Again, this wold help to eliminate one of the pesky bills many families have to pay for but through standard bus and taxi systems, paying for fuel will no longer be a hassle. Also, it is common knowledge that oil and gas are not reusable or nonrenewable resources so by cutting back on the amounts of these resources that are used, there will be a much more stable supply of these resources. Additionally, burning oil and gas has been causing terrible problems for global warming and climate change so by reducing the amounts of these resources used, the climbing rates of global warming will begin to decrease and this problem will then be a thing of the past.

Lastly, due to all of the technology and research put in to these cars to make them as smart as they truly are, these cars are more able or better suited for life on the road compared to a normal person. In order to make the cars able to drive by themselves (with the slight help of a person) they needed sensors that could determine where it was safe to go and when there was danger ahead. As stated in the passage, ""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers"". When faced with a dangerous situation, these cars have the ability to quickly fix itself and avert from any danger or hazard there was. Because the driverless cars are adapted with this information, it is said that, ""The information from sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"". In a time of a crisis or need for diversion, driverless cars are much more suited to take on the situation than cars driven by humans. Driverless cars have features that regular cars cannot manage such as the ability to brake each wheel indiviually. No human could ever be so perfectly ready or able to take on a dangerous situation that they could control each wheel. So, by having technology drive the cars instead of humans, it is considerably safer for the passenegers in the vehicle.

In conclusion, not only is it more intersting to say that there is a car that can self-drive itself, these cars are safer, more efficient, and are more able to create a system similar to taxes or busses. It helps the environment, it helps the needing families, and it helps in the case of a dangerous situation.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4676279E486E,"In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. A positive aspect of driverless cars is Google cars have driven a million miles without a crash. The passage states, ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" According to the passage, a negative aspect for driverless cars is ""Theses samrt-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they require massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical,"" so they would be expensive to upgrade.

My position on driverless cars is they would be more of a positive affect in the world. In passage states, ""He envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" Brin believes that the future's public transportation systems will all be driverless. Brin also believes such cars would fundamentally change the world. The passages states, ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves.""

To make the cars smarter, they need to have newer systems put into the car. The text states, ""they needed a whole lot of senors."" Google modified a Toyota Prius with position-estimating senors on the rear wheel. They also put a senor on the roof. Google had placed cameras and the rearview mirror. They placed four automotive radar sensors in the car along with a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion senor.

The passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" states, ""Senors are nothing new, of course."" Automakers have been using senors for cars since the 1980s. They put them on the wheels for the creation of antilock brakes. The text states, ""Within 10 years, those senors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the dangerof out-of-control skids or rollovers."" The information from the brakes caused the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine.

The negative aspect of driverless drivers is why would anyone want a driverless car when that car still needs a driver? Huber states, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" So some of the manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. The radar is a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. All-in-all to make a drverless car, it would be really expensive.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Many car companies are considering this new technology for their own car brand, but is it really in the best interest of the drivers? Driverless cars are a dangerous creation because driverless cars are not soley driven by humans, the technology of the car is not guarunteed to be cooperative at all times, and there is the danger of law suits going against the people who manufacture these automobiles.

Automated driving is projected to be driven by the technology that it is equipped with most of the time. This is an unsafe idea because technology has proven to be faulty with many other inventions. This technology also encourages texting while driving. Not only is this against the law, but it is creating detromental habits for the drivers of the car. The car is in autopilot, but if the car malfuntions the driver may be too distracted by their phone to correct the mistake.

The technology of the car is the same as any other technology. New drivers may learn only how to drive an automated car. This can lead to carelessness and irresponsibility. If the innovative technology were to suddenly stop working, run down, or go into hyperdrive it could leave the car completely abliterated. This new technology is in no way completely trustworthy and will require many tests to prove the sucess. The technology of the car will also more than likely come with an extremely high price which few will be able to afford.

Lastly, the dangers of this car are high. Not only are they high because of the safety gear price , but it may also come with a price for the manufactureer. There is the chance of large lawsuits and sueing against the companies creating these cars. If a human was to gets injured in an accident created by the car, or if the car was bought with faulty technology, these companies could be facing extremely large law suits with multidigit numbers in cash.

Overall, driverless cars are an unsafe idea. This car could leave a lot of damage to many. Driverless cars a bad idea because they are not soley controlled by humans, the technology of the car is not guarunteed to be cooperative at all times, and there is a danger of lawsuits going against the people who manufacture these automobiles.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
926706BFA109,"Technology is the future, and with the advancement of technology comes the addition of responsibility for the people using it. One hundred and fifty years ago, we had a thriving textile industry, and the long awaited introduction of railroads and canals. Today, we are advancing with the hopes of creating a cost efficient self-driving vehicle that people from all reaches of the world can use. While this task may prove to be difficult, it is definitely a task that we should take on. Self-driving cars are a beneficial gateway to mastering concepts like artificial intelligence. Continuous experimentation with self-driving, or driverless cars will only prove to be benefical to humanity. I believe that the development of driverless cars will make driving safer, create opportunities in transportation, and lead on to greater advancments in technology.

Think of a world where technology is what gets people from one location to another. One would get in their vehicle, speak or type in a few commands, and be on the way to their desired location. If scientists can master driverless cars, the road would be a much safer place. Driverless cars would make many less mistakes than the average human being. With the use of the advanced sensors, GPS, and radars that have been developed, cars will be able to communicate with one another and make decisions faster than any human. Every vehicle will be on a network communicating with one another, allowing for the safest and most efficient driving. The mental and physical aspects of humans play a huge role in driving conditions. A human's driving capabilities are hindered by mental and physical feelings like anger or fatigue. These feelings do not have an effect on driverless cars. Driverless cars can only make the road a safer and more efficient place, as they are able to communicate with one another and eliminate common human mistakes.

Driverless cars are a stepping stone for greater transportation. With the developments of these technologies, improvements will be made in all aspects of transportation. Bus travel will become safer and more efficient. When this technology hits the world of aviation, planes and other aircraft will go beyond what they are today. Flying already uses extremely advanced technologies, but scientists can definitely push it to be better. When a well-made driverless car is developed, doors are opened for all types of transportation. Driverless cars will not only revolutionize all aspects of transportation, but it will also open doors in other areas of technology.

With the advancement of driverless cars, comes the eventual advancement of other technologies. The investment in the development of driverless cars will yield a great reward. Scientists will be able to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, which plays a huge role in driverless cars. Artificial intelligence pushes for a greater future, as it allows for robots and alike technologies to complete tasks that would be difficult or time consuming for humans. Radars and sensors will also improve. People see radar technology in the weather, and GPS systems. With the advancements of radar technology, there will be a day when scientists can detect a tornado hours before it is going to touch down. At that point in time, there may even be technology to stop natural disasters.

In conclusion, driverless cars will take time to perfect, but driverless cars will be worth it when this perfection comes. There is a plethera of advantages that driverless cars bring to the table. They make the driving world a safer, and more efficient place. The technologies used in driverless cars also open doors to new types of technology. The benefits heavily outweigh the consequences when it comes to the development of driverless cars. When the world wanted to reach the stars, we did, so now let us reach for a technology that will make the world a better place.           ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
D332F4EF5948,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it has driven me to say that I am all for driverless cars. Using details from the article I can tell you exactly why. I think it is very helpful to people who could use it. Driverless cars would have to create new laws, but then again they would be helpful. Technology is coming far in this world, driverless are only the beginning.

My position on driverless cars are that I'm all for it. I believe that they would come in handy in the future. Even, if they are assisting you , who can't use a little extra assisting? The article says, "" The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" (stated in paragraph 4). Having that there to help you, would be so helpful and useful.

Having a driverless car would be so helpful in many different and wonderful ways. As I mentioned in the last paragraph it's laser beams surroundings of the car. Not only that but, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" , also, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves.""(both stated in paragraph 7). Those are two of the many ways that driverless cars are very helpful.

With new cars come new laws, and with these new laws come safer roads. Some new laws would have to be laws that cover liability in accidenys because who's fault would it really be? In paragraph 9 it states, "" If technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"", and they have a good point, but it would automatically be the manufacturer because the driver does not have full control over the car. The article also states, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times"", which is why they wouldnt know who's fault it would be. Therefore, the laws they crete are only meant to keep people safe.

Coming to a conclusion, I still believe that driverless cars are very helpful to people who could use them. Despite creating new laws, they are very helpful to keeping people safer aswell. The driverless cars are very helpful and wonderful in many and different ways. In my opinion, driverless cars could possibly help the world in ways you wouldn't even think they could.

5E259D12208D,"Driverless cars are coming. Now imagine a future where everyone has a driverless car. In some movies driverless cars are shown. In 2009, Google created a car that drove more than half a million miles without a crash. However, Google, BMW, and GM cars aren't truly driverless. The cars still need a human controling them. Their cars need features like a vibrating seat, flashing lights, or a camera that alerts the drivers when to take control of the vehicle.

One of the features that some driverless cars have is a vibrating seat. GM developed a seat that vibrates when the hevicle is in danger and it needs a human to take control of it. For example, When the car is backing into an object the drivers seat vibrates and a human has take control of it to prevent a crash.

Another feature that driverless cars have is flashing lights. Some cars have this feature. The lights start flashing when the car needs someone to take control of it. For example, In a workzone the car can't pass, so it needs someone to control it. The lights start flashing to alert the driver that it needs to control it in oder to pass.

The third feature that driverless cars will have is a camera. Manufactures are considering using cameras. Manufatures wants to use cameras to see if drivers are focused on the road. For example, While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.

I acknowledge that some people don't want driverless cars. However, those who don't like the idea should stay away from driverl. ess cars and leave the concept to people that want it. Driverless cars are not for everyone. Driver less cars are for people that can aford it.

It isn't so much not wanting these cars to happen, but rather it's about what this development is. it has essentially just opened up another way to be lazy. While automaton cars aren't a bad thing in the least, their existence could begin a new era of trouble.

Obesity is a big problem, and let's face it, it's because of typical american diets just exaggerating the calories we don't burn because of how lazy the general population is. And on top of that, it still requires a manual driver, in case of something it doesnt recognize that needs to be maneuvered around. If a bad driver happened to be behind the wheel and such an event occured, disaster would surely follow. I don't mean to be, well, mean, but introducing a new car that can drive itself would have horrible backlash in the future, when the newest generations would know only the self driving cars.

It could have all been prevented with the introduction of driverless cars. Autonomous cars are more reliable, more effective, and safer than modern vehicles.

Autonomous cars will be much more reliable than common cars. Google has had cars out that have been semi-independent sine 2009. While the cars do have drivers for some issues such as complicated traffic the car does the majority of the work. With slight developments the cars have the potential to be fully autonomous. One easy solution to this is to simply have the cars GPS connect to the local news studio and hire people in that building to update the GPS to show heavy traffic and road work so the car can just avoid them.

Recent developments have made the cars more effective as well, for example they would offer much more flexibility than your avarage bus. The bus has a set route of stops and pick ups, wherein the car could pick people up at the bar and take them safely home. This not only reduces the amount of tickets, but it also saves lives. Think how great the world would be without people dying to drunk driving. Not only that but the cars also consume less gas and require less people.

Speaking of people, The cars would be much safer than your avarage taxi, people never know the whole story behind a cab driver. It's possible that a cab driver isn't a certified cab driver, found the taxi sign at a junkyard, painted his car yellow. This leaves people in a dangerous spot when calling a cab on the streets of new york. A driverless car could pick people up and there would be no danger for the user. Another part that makes the car safer is that it can sense things better than a human can. This cars are outfitted with a massive quantity of sonars and sensors to check for other vehicles. Not only is the car safer for the person inside it is also safer for everyone else. A smart car will never have road rage, as it is a computer, without the capability to feel it will never get angry. A smart car won't run people off of the road because its feelings got hurt.

In conclusion, Autonomous cars are very reliable, effective, and safe. Think of all the Bobs in the world who because of one bad decision have not only lost their life but ruined the lives of those who loved them. it is possible that autonomous cars can prevent it from happening in the future.

Would this car be expensive to produce? Do we really need a driveless car? This concept needs to be tossed away and we need to focus on the now instead of the later.

Safety is a big concern we have in our country. how do we keep people safe? Driveless cars will only add to this concern. In paragraph 9 the author states ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" this statement sparks a concern for people. What if the technology fails? how will we be able to stop an accident in a car that drives it self? We need to think that if there is a mistake in the programming of the car or the production, that a person life is at stake. This is a good reason why these cars shouldn't be produced and that is for the risk that we could lose people to somehting we won't have control over.

Another safety hazard is the unthinkable accidents. Anything can happen, and when somehting occurs how will this driverless car respond? In paragrph 7, the author states that the car will alert the driver to take control if there are work zones or to move the car around an accident. Those are things we can expect to happen but what about the the things we may not expect? How will the car alert us if the unknown happens? If there was a construction mishap and a beam falls down to hit the road, the car wouldn't have enought time to alert us.

We wouldnt have the time to react to such an event quickly enough.\

When an accident happens, who will be at fault, the driver or the manufacturer? As a new way to get around comes out, we need to make laws for the driving speed limits and other things. If a driverless car came on to the scene, what would happen in a accident? who would be at blame for the accident. It's a serious question that needs to be answered. It cant be the drivers because they had no control. At the same time it can't be the one who made the car either, depending on the accident. This car isn't safe for us. How will we even decide the laws for driving if its a car that drives it's self?

The idea of a driveless car is interesting and it's futuristic. We may someday have the capablities to even construct a car that can. Even so, There is too much bad that can happen and to many questions on how will we even react to these situations.

The car would be moving somewhat out of your control especially if used as a public transportation vehicle. This would make the older generations worry about their kids and grandkids since they realize it could break down anytime anywhere.

The vehicle could easily be labled as dangerous since the text states, ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"" 500,000 miles is good but you have to be under certain conditions. How good would the car work if you can't or live to far away to drive under these special conditions? The car might malfunction or go crazy, it could just simply blow up. Due to these statements this car could be labled dangerous.

The car could also be labled dangerous for its inability to pull in and out of driveways. This could be a hazard for the young kids who are just learning how to drive and think the car can do everything for them like Google makes it look like it can. Backing out of a driveway can be a very dangerous action to accomplish because if there are obstacles blocking the view of the road you can not see cars going past you.

The car can also be a dangerous vehicle because if you are driving and get drowsy or something with nobody else in the car with you, you could run right through a construction site. This is obviously a big concern for a lot of people because a construction site can have many hazardous tools that could kill you instantly even with protection of a car. Its a dangerous car for you and also the people around yo.

Safety? Everyone wants to know how safe they are and how reliable they are. Many people have developed semi-driverless cars. In fact Google ""has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditons since 2009"". The key words are ""specific conditions"". No one has developed a car that is fully driverless.

The cars that have been developed still need a driver. What's the point of having a driverless car, when you still need a driver? Some people who don't fully trust the concept, like me, need some control. That's why some manufacturers are ""bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays"" to alert the driver when he/she needs to take over. Many manufacturers have developed an alert system, GM ""has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object"". Some others include a simple announcement and flashing lights.

The law has also made it hard to develope these driverless cars. What would happen if someone was to wreck in a driverless car? Would it be the driver's fault or the car's?

The ""traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driverin control at all times"".

If thats the case then i dont think there is any point in making driverless cars because no matter what someone is always driving bad on the streets.

The feeling of not having to drive your car and being able to sit back and relax in your car is nice but, I dont see how that could possibly work because if you were to get into a accident then whats coming back on you, what are you first to do? Sue the manufactuer or is it in your fault since you own the car. The last thing , If driverless cars were to be on the streets you would think everybody would have one? I would think the pricing would be a ridiclous amount of money because of how much time they invested in making driverless cars succsessfull.

Driverless cars was defeintly a brillant idea but at this point in time i dont think they have a strong enough impact for it to workout. Transportation has become a huge impact upon the nation today because without it people would have to walk everywhere and that would be time consuming. I think this essay has a great arguement wheather or not that this is a good idea but in my postion i think the best way to go is just to try and be as safe as possible on the roads and pay attention at all times on the road.

The development of driverless cars would be an amazing thing.

So many bad situations could be avoided with driverless cars because the human drving a car is an enormous variable.

The payoff of using driverless cars would be giant as well.

Granted, it would be expensive and the period of time it would take to completely phase out regular cars would be lengthy, it would be a worthwhile investment into the future.

The development of driverless cars would be an amazing in incredibly helpful step for society and the car manufacturing world.

Every year hundreds of thousands of people are killed in car accidents.

Many of those accidents are a result of neglegence on the fault of the driver.

Driving while under the influence, driving and texting, driving and making calls, driving and eating, driving and putting make-up on; all are things that cause car accidents that could be avoided with driverless cars. With driverless cars, passengers would be able to go on the road and not have to deal with the stress that comes with driving around on busy roads, or the stress that comes with taking into consideration bad drivers, other people driving under the influence, or just other drivers in general.

Driverless cars would eliminate the biggest variable regarding cars: the driver.

A driverless car would be beneficial to many people, but they would be even more beneficial to the companies and factories that construct and sell the cars.

They would be expensive to buy, but would pay off themselves every time an incident is avoided.

Not to mention, eventually the regular cars would be phased out.

This means that car companies who build and sell the driverless cars would be making a sensational amount of money.

Finding the equptment to build all the driverless cars would be expensive and time consuming, but the process would be worth it to have all the new cars made and on the roads.

Driverless cars would change the way the world works.

There would be no ""new driver anxiety"" when teens get their liscenses.

There would be a dramatic decrease in the death-by-vehicle statistics.

It would not be suprising if one day people no longer needed to buy cars, similar to the article when Sergey Brian said, ""...such cars would change the world."".

There are so many options that arise when considering such an invention.

What is a city decided to have fleets of taxis and buses with driverless cars?

Driverless cars would be an added benefit.

Then no one would have top buy a car and spend the money to take car of it with upkeep, and car companies would still make a lot of money.

With driverless cars, the impact on the environmet would be very much less than those cars of today.

The options and pros are endless when it comes to driverless cars.

The world would experience a shift in function if driverless cars were introduced.

The number of deaths and accidents involving automotives would decrease exponetially and life would be a little less stressful for many.

The attack on the environment would be lessened, and roads would be safer.

There are pros and cons for any situation, but in the case of driverless cars, the pros seem to greatly outweigh the cons.

The quality of life would increase, and the variable of the human driver would be eliminated. Driverless cars would be an excellent addition to the car lots and would be an amazing tool for people in everyday life.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E059AC481E5D,"Driverless cars are a smart idea in my opinion. There are multiple benefits of having a driverless car, and even though there are disadvantages as well, the pros out weigh the cons in this case. The inventors of these types are cars are extremely bright people and know what they are doing. There have been studies shown how beneficial driverless cars can be and I agree with them.

The next new thing in technology car wise would be a driverless car. Sebastian Thrun said that it would not have been possible to make something this interesting before 2000 because we did not possess the equipment and tools we needed to accomplish much. However, as time has gone on and technology has become better, we are able to make driverless cars now. The people that are working on the driverless cars are making them as safe as possible. The cars contain many sensors to warn the driver when assistance is needed. For example, in the passage it says, that the drivers seat will vibrate in case the vehicle may back over something. There are also flashing lights on the windshield as a warning sign. The inventors have also created cameras to make sure the car can watch the driver to be sure they are alert. A driverless car would be an amazing accomplishment but as of right now the car cannot do everything by itself. The drivers would still need to pay attention and be ready to take the wheel at any moment. Since the driverless car is still a work in progress, it cannot drive through construction or accident cites easily. The inventors of the car are making it safe with all the sensors and warning signals needed, but sometimes that is not enough, accidents still could occur. If an accident were to occur I do not believe that the manufacturers should be blamed. They have made the car the best they can and would not allow people to drive it without warning them about how the car works. In my opinion it would most likely be the drivers fault for not paying attention or neglecting the warnings of the car. A driverless car will be a fantastic accomplishment to be made. However, we as the potential drivers have to take caution and understand completely how to handle the car.

I know that someday there will be driverless cars that can travel through accident and construction cites without any help. However, until then we must work with what we have and try our best not to jeopardize the chances of building an actual driverless car. We as drivers can accomplish this by being alert when riding in a driverless car and being understanding if an accident were to occur. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4102DC08CA36,"Driverless cars are the future of transportation. The technologies that we have right now limit us in what we can do in the field of driverless cars but sometime in the near future we will have fully driverless cars. Car engineers are already pushing the envelope on what they put in cars as far as technology and computer systems. There has also been a rise in the number of cars that are running with electric engines, which will be necessary to driverless cars. These three pieces of evidence are all reasons why cars of the future should not require an active driver.

The technologies that we have today are amazing to older generations that thought that having a car was crazy. Even with our advanced technologies we still do not have advanced enough technolgies to have fukky driverless cars. As the passage stated, ""Google cars arent truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This statement shows that even companies that have the latest and greatest technologies are not able to make a truly driverless car. Even though we are not able to make a fully driverless car today, our technologies are still advancing at a higher rate than ever before.

The technologies that we have in cars toaday are truly amazing and extremely advanced compared to what the standard of technology was in a car ten years ago. That is because car engineers are working their hardest to put as much technology as possible in the cars that they are making. The 2017 Ford Focus is supposed to be able to park for you and it is able to tell you when you are okay to change lanes on the interstate. Tesla has projected for a car to come out this year that is supposed to be 90 percent driverless. These are just two examples of car engineers trying there hardest to put the most technology in vehicles as they can. As you can see this is being done by both luxury brands, such as Tesla and BMW, and by everyday brands, such as Ford. One of the main problems with running a carr that is completely driverless is that there needs to be a main frame that the cars computer systems can run off of, and that main frame starts with an electric engine.

Almost every car company now a days makes at least on vehicle with a completely elctric engine. This is good that electric engine cars are starting to be made usable and can now start to be perfected because electric engines are necessary to a fully driver less car. A fully driver less car will have a lot of computer systems that are necessary to opperate the vehicle. These computer systems will all need a main frame to run off of which means the majority of the car is going to be elcetric anyways. Wouldn't it make sense for the engine to be on the smae page as the rest of the car. Just think, instead of you have to go fill up your fully driverless car with gas and then having to go charge it, you could go charge it and refuel the engine at the same time.

The technolgies to make a fully driverless car are not avalable to us yet but they will be in the near future. Car engineers are already making cars partially driveless so it is only a matter of time until they are fully driverless. Electric engines are already found in a lot of cars and they would be necessary in a fully driverless car which means we are going in the right direction. It is only a matter of time until we will have all of the technologies necessary to have fully driverless cars. So the question is, will you be picking up your next car from the dealer ship or will it be driving to your home?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E81B29CC415E,"Driverless cars are too expensive, trivial, and dangerous to be developed for public use. The development of these cars would require extensive funding, and this money could be much better spent. Some of these cars would only be partially automated and would still require a capable driver at all times, so what would be the point? Finally, driverless cars would be concerning from a safety standpoint - would these cars really be able to safely maneuver out of dangerous situations?

First, the development of driverless cars would be expensive. Automated cars require many sensors and cameras that regular cars do not need, and even with these sensors, the cars are not capaple of completely driving themselves. In order to achieve a reliable driverless system, all of our roads would have to have electricity or magnets installed, which even the article admits would be ""too expensive to be practical"". Furthermore, the money spent on developing these cars could be spent to help those who are less fortunate rather than creating new things for ourselves.

Another issue with driverless cars is the idea of cars that only assist the driver. These cars would drive most of the time, but they would, ""notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". These cars would certainly be helpful, but what would be the point of having a self-driving car if you still have to watch the road as if you were driving yourself? Some manufacturers talk of adding, ""in-car entertainment and information systems,"" but if the driver were focused on these systems, would they be able to react quickly enough if the car approached a dangerous situation?

This question leads to what is probably the biggest issue with these cars: many developers of driverless cars claim that these vehicles would improve public transportation and, ""use half the fuel of today's taxis,"" but what about the safety of the passengers? A truly driverless car would leave its passengers helpless in the face of an impending accident, and the addition of entertainment systems for part-time drivers would likely not give the drivers enough of a warning to react in the case of an emergency situation.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be developed on a large scale. The huge amount of money that would have to be spent to make these cars safe would be much better spent helping those in need. Furthermore, cars that only partially drive themselves seem to defeat the intended purpose of the driverless car, as well as raising some safety concerns. It would be extremely difficult for the car alone to avoid dangerous situations, and the addition of entertainment systems would limit how much time a driver would have to assess and respond to danger. In all, driverless cars are far too expensive, needless, and dangerous to be developed or produced on a large scale.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
49E99CF77032,"I beleive that the development of self driving cars would better our future. The introduction of self driving cars is a positive because they give the driver more freedom to do other productive things, they still give the driver some control over the car incase bad condition come up, and they use many different sensors to ensure the passengers safety.

Self driving cars give people the freedom to do more productive things instead of driving. This is helpful because people could get more work done in the car. Which in some cases people can commute many hours, giving them valuable time to work. A concern with this could be distracting the driver from being alert incase the car needs assistance. Although as stated in the article ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up display. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over"". This means that drivers could use the systems already put in the cars that are regulated by the car itself so that if there is an emergency, the car can shut down the devices.

The cars are smart enough to know when they should let the passeneger take over. This is important because it shows you that the cars still give you control in certain situations, and they only drive in conditions that would otherwise be easy. Stated in the article, it says ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". Th car can handle driving functions at speeds of up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless"". This means that if the car starts to lose control or go into bad conditions, the passenger can take over.

The cars that are modified to be self driven are highly equipped with technology to help the car. Stated in the article ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and a inertial motion sensor... The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings"" These sensors all make the car have the important information to make decisions just like a human would when behind the wheel.

I think that self driving cars would be a positive because they give the driver free time to be productive, they still give the driver control in certain situations, and they use many sensors to ensure the safety of the passengers. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Creating driverless cars can waste a lot of money. Everything a car has now you'll need triple that amount.

So the car company losses custemers. The car always needs a real human to drive the car.

Most states have driving laws that make it illegal to drive or even test these electronically driven cars, manufacturers are getting hopeful that when these cars are ready, safe, and fully advanced the laws will be changing.

First, todays trffic laws are ""... written with the assumption that the only safe cars has a human driver in control at all times."", which means that the manufacturers must make a car thta keeps the driver, passenger, and any pedestrians safe. Manufacturers believe that once these cars prove more reliably safe that more states will grow onto the idea of driverless cars. Having driverless cars is a good idea because they also will only use around half of the fuel used in todays average taxi. So far Google has had these cars drive half a million miles without a single crash!

In conclusion autonomous cars should be a part our future. These cars have been test driven around 500,000 miles without a single crash.

Right now developers across the globe are working towards a Self operating vehicle, one that could change the lives of people everywhere for the better. These ""Driverless Cars"" could prevent dangerous accidents, allow the driver to enjoy a safe and easy trip, as well as save precious fuel while cutting down polution.

Driverless cars programmed to obey and follow the rules of the road all while keeping its passengers safe. The average licenesed individual has been in or witnessed an accident, and they know how horrifying and potentially hurtful one can be. That can be stopped the new technology being developed can allow the cars to follow all driving laws, allow the passenger to take over in a state of emergency, and if the streets are filled with these law abiding vehicles there will be virtually no violations that could result in a fatal or harmful accident. Where as drivers today panic, drink and drive, as well as text and drive which leads to several hundreds of innocent lives lost every year.

Imagine sitting back relaxing listening to a great song that just came on not having to worry about other cars around you beacuse the one your in can handle itself. If these new revolutionary vehicles are allowed to take the streets constant worry of unsafe drivers will be deminished. Crash and acident rates would be at an all time low and travel would be so much more enjoyable. Yes these vehicles in there current state may ask for the drivers help every once in awhile, but the Google car drove 500,000 miles accident free, Remarkable.

Finally they would allow us to save and cut down on fuel use, and with supplies fading this could be a huge factor in saving what reserves we have left. They also could be powered by electricity which would remove the fuel factor as a whole and reduce polution rates to a minimal.

I am against driverless cars because the cars aren't completely driverless, there will have to be new laws made for these vehicles, and there would be confusion for who to blame.

In the article, the author gave examples as to how the cars were given features that'd make them seem driverless. There were, of course, radar features and motion sensors, but at the end of the day the author of the artilce said, ""..None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" Now of course they can still do the things needed to drive i. e. steer, speed up, and break, but there are still special sensors made to make sure that the driver still has their hands on the wheel. The author of the article then says, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Meaning that the driver must be focused at all times.

Other than the fact that the cars aren't completely driverless, there would have to be new laws added for this new technology. In the ninth paragraph the author says, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe...traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This means that the laws now do not include anything regarding driverless cars, basically making them illegal to put on the road.

There are many positive aspects to having driverless cars. With the improvements in software cars can now handle more driving tasks on their own. These cars can steer, navigate, and brake themselves.

Now, the big issue is creating driverless cars. This idea is extremely terrific and can cause a breakthrough in modern technology.

With driverless cars, no one needs to worry about buying any cars anymore. Sergey Brian thinks that ""driverless cars [can] form a public-transport taxi system."" This taxi-system will be able to take people to and fro wherever they like. Also, these cars will most likely only use up half of the fuel that regular taxis take.

Driverless cars will be more efficient than humans because of their faster response to driving situations. This is possile by sensors that ""can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine."" Many sensors will have to be placed on the car to provide the safest driving possible. Google has put many sensors on their modified version of a Prius, such as on the wheel, roof, rearview mirror, and even a 3-D camera ontop of the roof. All of these sensors help to mimic the actual driving skills of a human, but better.

Some people may argue that the driverless cars are not safe because they still need some help from the passenger for emercency situations. They are wrong because humans can manage to stay alert while the driverless car is still driving. The car can manage to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.""

This is only because the car has not been programmed to handle crashes, or roadside dangers yet. However, manufacturers are making new ""in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" These will help keep the driver alert at all times and enjoy their ride.

The passage gives many reasons why driverless cars would be good and why they'd also be bad. In my opinion they'd just cause more trouble than regular cars already do. In the passage it says how they have a lot of sensors, and gadgets to make them ""safe,"" but what happens when one or a two of those sensors go out? And then the owner of the car doesn't have the money to go out and buy a new one. They're going to be driving a car that not only is putting themselves in danger, but also the people around them.

Another reason why I believe that driverless cars wouldn't be a good idea is because of what was stated in paragraph 9. What's going to happen when the car gets in an accident and causes damage to another driverless car? We already have laws that go along with regular cars, and to whom is at fault when an accident happens. These cars are going to cause so much more drama than there already is! There are going to be accidents, there is no way we can avoid it. There are going to be malfuntions in the driverless car. There are still malfunctions in the cars we drive today and you see how long we've been dribing them around! Driverless cars are only going to cause more problems that we don't need.

How exactly are people going to be able to determine whether or not they're going to be safe on the roads if a car is doing all of the work for them? I just don't see how people expect this all to work out, but then again this is probably what people were thinking when they were transitioning over from hourse and buggies to automobiles.

I believe driverless cars are a bad idea. There are dozens of details in this article to back me up on this. I've always believed why change something that's already good? It's like your mom making your favorite apple pie. It's the best apple pie you've ever had in your life. And one day your mom decides she wants to change it up a bit, and that change just completly ruins it for you. It'll never be the same again because of that one time that she decided to change it up. And that's how I see driverless cars. I see them as something that'll just ruin it for everyone. Manually driving a car gives you such a rush, it's the first thing in your life that makes you feel independent. It makes in feel like you're finally in control of your life for the first time. I feel as though it would be a shame to take that away from the people who haven't experienced it for themselves.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
905A76FFA540,"When driverless cars come up in convesation must people will be like ""wow so cool"", but most people do not know what they are talking about and they think they just want to look cool in front of people with their cool new gadgets. Driverless cars are easilly a good thing, but why? Most likely driverless cars are safer with more advanced technology than we have now and they also can prevent some pollution that the public transportation system gives off in the major cities. Most people think that driverless cars are dangerous or they think they are just some cool technology.

Driverless cars are a good thing to come, but not anytime soon. Driverless cars can prevent accidents from happening. Teenage drivers are the leading cause of accidents worldwide because they are knew to it or they are on their phone while they are driving. Just think if teenagers had a driverless car the accident rate would go way down and the teenagers that are so young would stop getting killed. Driverless cars are not just for teens, but for everyone think of the elderly, in some peoples opinions old people or senior citizens should not be able to drive. Driverless cars could help get elderly to their bingo games safe and on time. Paragraph nine states ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" Now people know that teenagers are never going to listen and put their phones down because they think they are smarter than the last person who was texting and driving. It says that ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe.""(9). Well one way they can do that is with driverless cars.

Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that driverless cars can replace public transportation such as taxis or busses. Major cities in the United States have the highest pollution globally and that is to blame the public transportation system along with many other things, but public transportation is one of the main factors. Sergey Brin envisions ""a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system.""(1). We do not know if this will be happening some time in the near future or years down the road. Sergey claims that the driverless cars would ""use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""(1). Well since we know that major cities usually have some sort of public transportation system now they are letting off huge amounts of pollution and using a lot of fuel each and every hour of the day. Something has to change Sergey Brin says he wants to cut the taxis and busses feul in half by using driverless vehicles instead. He states the vehicles would ""offer far more flexibility than a bus.""(1). We do not know what this statement means, but if it means that he can make driverless busses that recieve better fuel economy than a regular bus that is polluting the earth. That would be a really big improvement if he could accomplish that. Stopping global warmming should be a big topic of discussion and driverless cars could have a big impact on stopping global warmming.

Most people do not think about how the impact on society that driverless cars can bring to the table. People do not think about how the cars could potentially save teenagers lives or their family or anyone for that matter. Also, they do not think about the fact that driverless cars could replace the public transportation system and stop one of the main factors contributing to the pollution or global warmming. Some instances driverless cars could be a bad thing in our world and some people just want to look cool. Citizens have to look at it from a different prospective and imagine a safer and less polluted place. Driverless cars are the future and they are only going to raise more conflicts.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
0204D8150596,"Driverless cars would be cool, but they're not safe enough to have around. The drivers have nothing to do, the driverless feature in the car could get messed up, or even the things that alert the driver that it's their turn to drive. There are so many dangers to having driverless cars, this is just a few.

For example when all the driver has to do is sit there, it will be takenadvantage of. People could fall asleep at the wheel and not be able to take over the driving when they're needed to. A lot more messing around would occur so the driver would not be focusing. Drivers need to stay focused on the road so everyone can safely arrive to their destination.

Never know when the driverless feature could have a glitch or break down. Cars break down all the time, what's any different about the cars systems? Nothing, these cars could have been manufactured incorrectly. The GPS could also stop working or hit a glitch and you could end up 20 miles away from where you want or need to be.

Imagine. You're in your driverless car, somethings coming up that you need to take over for, but you're just talking away and having a big jam session with all your friends. Your car means to alert you but the system is broken, the car keeps moving but it thinks you're driving, you hit a construction worker. Now you have a huge fine to pay plus you have to get your car fixed.

With these new driverless cars their drivers aren't going to be paying enough attention, your car glitches out, or you're to busy having a jam session with your friends. So many things could go wrong. These cars would be teaching the youth they don't need to pay attention, the car will do it for them.

A34932BEDFA2,"When people thing of the future they think of the movie ""Back To The Future"" hoping that one day the society we live willone day become like that. Technology has advanced and scientists have found ways to make the movie fantasy of the 80's come to life. But, are driverless cars really a great thing for this society?

I believe that a driverless car is a frightening thing to see, even thought there are great pros that come with the idea, cons win in my belief. For example, car accidents happen almost all the time and they can be deadly. With a driverless car would be even worst. Who is it that we are to blame? The driver of the manufacturer? This also, questions new traffic laws if they were to be put in plan. It is already worst enough in my belief that we as amaericans have to go to a court a argue our arguement, to then have to sit infront of a judge that decides wether it is my fault of the fault of the manufacturer. It believe that it would not be a fair fight.

Car accidents, and court dates can be deadly both physically and mentally. But you know what is more deadly? Obesity. Did you know that the United States of America has the most Obesity rate in the whole world? Now, do we really want driverless cars that just take us anywhere we want, to the point that the only walking I would do is from the parking lot the the inside of the store? Children are the new face of America the futurte is held in our hands.

It would be insane to see a young adult dead at the age of just twenty-one. We are already fighting obesity and trying to lower the rate, but if we add more to the problem instead of helping it, America's death rate will be massive. More that it already is.

Obesity is one thing but going bankrupt is another. In our modern society today. Our world is surrounded by technology, we thrive off if it, we live, it. We breath it. It is like an addicting drug that not even a reheb center can fix, but it just takes self control, that people today don't seem to have. Techonology is so expensive that people are willing to give to great lengths to spoil their children with. There are more important things that driverless car, that could cost up to more than your house. For example, utility bills, they have to be paid without them you don't have much to live for then, they driverless car is not going to feed you. What is even worst in my belief is if you go bankrupt and loose everything you've worked up for just to then waste is all on a car that could later kill you or make you fatter. Either way you die, right?

In conclusion, driverless cars will be a bad impact on our society, and I believe that if we agree to an aburd thing such as a driverless car that our ecomomic system will have such a downfall. with obese children and poor people walking around that we will enter such a horrible downfall in health, money and large amounts of death rates.

006E0B604E93,"Thinking about a future with self-driving cars make me think about shows and movies I would watch growing up. The fact that driverless car might be avaliable in the years soon to come get me really excited. For as long as I can remember, there has been films out about the future and they always seem to have some sort of driverless car or things similar to that. Since the late 1950's people where already starting to come up with concepts about self-driving cars.

My position on the whole driverless cars in the future is that I am pro self-driving cars. And, here are a few reasons why. The cars they plan on making in the future would use up half of the fuel today's cars use. Using less fuel will put us on the right path of working to reduce the use of fossil fuels , and help cut down on pollution as a whole.

Another reason why I am pro diverless car, is because self-driving cars have been tested to drive more than half a million miles without crashing, when compared to humans driving cars. They have also added many saftey feature to these type of cars. Like, sensors that can help prevent skids and rollovers. Overall, driverless cars while have many, many saftey feature to create safer roads.

Now, like anything else there is cons to the pro's i have just mentioned. One of them being that, they will just cost so much money, wway more than regular cars. Like wise, in some states there are laws put in place that will not even allow for such cars like self-driving cars to even be tested. Another thing that was brought up is, "" What if the driver gets boerd having to wait for their turn to drive?"". Meaning that, car prototypes have a feature that will drive for you but, you have to have your hands on the wheel and the car will swich over to the drive incase of the event ther is road work or acciedent. And, one of the most important things that was mentioned in the article is, ""what is the driver where to get in an accident while in a self-driving car?"", would the car manufactuer be at fault or the person in the driverless car. Cases like this will be hard to solve due to the many factor involved. All in all there are some negatives aspects to the self-driving car.

To reflect back on everything, having self-driving, or driverless car would be an amazing accoplishment for the human race. There are some cons and some pros to the whole situation, but for me, I am pro driverless cars. Think about all of the inventions that could come from the driverless car. This will open new doors of opportunity for the next generations, as well as this one. This could all impact the quality of life drastically. Everything we do will have an impact on the future. So, we should continue work on protypes to make the roads a better and a safer place.   ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
3648A95056F3,"In the article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨ it gives us information about how the future is coming up with a whole lot of knew technology, but they have there downsides. Although there are still some problems with the driverless cars, I think it would be a great invention. Driverless cars could reduce car crashes, it would be less expensive, less pollution and many more great features. There are some small bugs at the moment, but anything can be fixed.

Driverless cars could help cause less accidents because of all of the sensors it would have. Google´s modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimation sensorson the right wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. These are the recent added technologies and if we wait a little longer possibilities are endless. They would help lessen the amount of crashes because the sensors tell you when things are around or in the way of the car. Driverless cars could help avoid accidents and although they aren´t fully capable of reducing all accidents they could reduce most accidents.

Gas prices have always gone up and down. No matter what car you drive it requieres fuel. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a public transportation system that use half the fuel of today´s taxis and offere more flexibility than a bus. Driverless cars would be less inexpensive, they could economically help us. Gas prices will most likely not change but instead of spending 50$ on gas wouldn´t you want to spend 25$ on gas or maybe even 30$. Although buying a driverless car would be expensive and mostlikely cost you two arms and a leg in the end it would be worth it.

Lastly I feel like it would be the technology we need to better our future. It would look nice having cars that potentially save pedestrians lives and help the driver stay safe. Some manufacturers hope that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. They also hope that some of the in-car systems could help reduce the amount of people who are on their phones while driving. This type of technology could save endless amount of lives and help better the world.

I feel like driverless cars could help many people. Especially as a teen and driving is new to them it could help because all the sensors would be there to help. Creating and legalizing driverless cars could help economically and safety wise. The world will never know whether this will be an actual thing or not but only the futere can tell, and I wouldn´t mind driverless cars driving around my home.

BF5253224A44,"The topic on driverless cars and be very controversial and tricky, and there are many different views on it. And this is rightly so, as there are plenty of possible positive outcomes from making automated cars, but there are plenty of issues regarding safety, laws, and money as well. As for my opinion, I think they can be very helpful in the future, but still need more testing and time to work out the many problems that come along with this topic.

I personally believe everyone could benefit from automated vehicles. They could help prevent accidents, as even if a drunk driver were to get into one, they could still avoid trouble if the path home is simple enough. The cars could help the elderly/disabled majorly because it could save their lives as well as the lives of others if one were to have any kind of accident whilst in the vehicle, and could also bring the convenience of not having to be transported by others. This applies to teenagers as well. We would not have to worry about reckless driving as much, and transportation could be cheaper and more reliable in the end.

A major disadvantage is that there is still a large risk of an accident occuring. For example, if a passenger gets bored and decides to stop paying attention to the road and the car comes upon an obstacle it can not get across, there is a large possibility of a crash. There are an abundance of ways to counter this though, as shown in paragraph 7. The cars could have sensors in them that automatically flip on the brakes when it detects something, or the vehicle could have some kind of alert that notifies when the driver should take over. Automated vehicles can cause conflict between the manufacturer and the consumer as well. Also stated in paragraph 9, issues could arise if the technology failed.

In conclusion, I believe these vehicles have an astounding amount of potential, but are still rough around the edges. I think we should give it time for the concept to mature more, and for more laws regarding safety to come out related to it. If the dedication is large enough, we could very well have much safer roads in the not-too-distant future.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
D454C44928A5,"Driverless cars are cars that will drive on its own, but they still need a driver right now for problems that happen and that needs a human, but are quickly become less reliant on humans for parts of the driving. Many different companies like Google and Volvo are making and testing driverless cars and there are some that we pass by everyday and we don't even know it.

Driverless are a good thing for everyone, for example you are a busy person and have a long drive to work? Well you can work one that long drive getting mroe things done, and when the car needs your assistance, you are there. They can help the enviroment because they can find the shortest route to the place you are going by GPS. And car accidents will decrease by a large amount if everyone, or almost everyone, drove driverless. Right now all of Googles car haven't crashed once except when another human driver hit them. Also if someone is a long road trip by themselfs they will get tired, that is a big cause of car crashes, but if driverless cars then the driver won't have to drive the car while tired on major highways, also reducing accidents. If we adopted driverless then there would be a taxt/ride-sharing for everone, just say you need a car and one will come and pick you up. Another big casue of crashes and deaths if drinking and driving, but with driverless car it will keep people under the influence from driving on roads and making the roadways a safer place for everyone. As our lives keep advancing, so does technology, and this technology and help us learn, live better lifes, be safe, and so much more. And driverless cars are just part of this technology push. Cars are another step to making our lives better. Most rockets and other veichles that go into space that carry people, supplys, and other objects are mostly automated by computers. If a computer can take a veichle to Mars, Pluto, the Moon. Then why can't it take us down the street. As time advances driverless cars will get better and safer for everybody involed. So why hasen't the world adopted driverless cars for the better of everybody? If more money was put into the research and production of driverless cars then they would be even better and safer.

All in all driverless cars are for the betterment of people and the advancement in technology. With more research going into driverless cars with big names behind it like, Google, Apple, Tesla, Volvo and more. Then why does it seem like the world isn't fully behind driverless cars yet.

75852347F2EF,"I think that driverless cars aren't an appropriate idea for this time period. There are multiple reasons why I believe this. We would need to do a lot more developing on roads, we would need to put an abundance of sensors in the car, there would need to be new laws made, and there's no practical use to a driverless car.

Firstly, there are very few roads in America, let alone Indiana, that would be suitable for a driverless car. Many roads have unexpected twists, turns, and dips that no sensor would be able to make a fast enough reaction time. If the sensors stopped working, or if there wasn't a fast enough reaction time, it would cause multiple wrecks. If we had to fix a majority of the roads for driverless cars, taxes would go up to pay for it. Nobody would want to pay that kind of money, especially when most people wouldn't be able to afford a driverless car.

Secondly, there would need to be an abundance of sensors in the car. Sensors aren't necessarily a bad invention for a car, but people shouldn't solely rely on them. Multiple things could go wrong with the sensors, sometimes without the driver or car even knowing. If the driver doesn't know that a sensor isn't functioning, they could be relying on it to mimic them at the wheel. Multiple wrecks could happen this way, and the only person to blame would be the driver with the driverless car, because they're the car who had their sensors malfunction.

Thirdly, there would be too many laws that would need to be changed and added. Paragraph nine says, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" A human driver is needed to make these laws and to enforce them. There would have to be new liability laws, and there would be conflict with the manufacturing company. Technology is the not the subject that should be at fault in this situation. The person who should be at fault is the driver, because the driver would be putting themselves, and everyone on the street at risk for driving a car that they are not in control of.

Lastly, there's no practical use for a driverless car. Driving is a privledge for young adults and adults. People are not given the right to drive, but they're given the privledge. There couldn't be anything more important for a driver than to focus on driving. If driverless cars are released to the public, what would people do while their car is being driven? They could sit on their phones or do something that wouldn't be worth their life or someone elses. Manual cars have been around for an abundance of years, and they've been doing just fine.

To sum this up, I believe that driverless cars are not worth the risk, or money, in people's lives. There would be too much developing roads and laws, and there would always be the risk of the driver not being in control of their car. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

With these new technological capabities the progression toward a new era of transportation seems inevitable and it is entirely possible that are advances will progress much faster than the legal regulations themselves. There are many reasons why autonomous cars will present a challange both from a technology standpoint, and a legal point of view, however I would maintain that this is just the simple nature of enlightenment or advancement and that if it is indeed possible then we should allow it to move forward. Right now the technology exists which would allow driverless cars to be on the road and probably work just fine 90% of the time; if the goverment or legal system set in motion for corporations to allow these vehicles to go to market once the demand icreases so will the technology itself. The one thing that is almost definitly clear is that based on the assumption that almost all the technology to acheive this feat is already in place the question is not so much if we will acheive it, its when? Or more specificly how quickly can law makers decide on a reasonable way to regulate and allow the technology to move forward. After all the advantages to such an indevior would be incredible especially if it were implemented on a national scale. For an example over time it could get to the point that autonomous cars could reach a level of sophisticatian would allow the computer systems to communicate with other cars allowing them to perdict and avoid collisions all together. There would also be no need for setting speed limits on roads which would divert public resources to a much more useful endevor. As mentioned in the article there may not even be any need for many people to even own cars this would probably be the case in many cities where a new market system would be in place where people could simply lease cars out for the day and the car could return itself back to the shop. There would also be little or no liability to the user of the car because of the software would have complete control over the system 99% of the time. However this does raise some intersting problems especially for the manufacturer and the legal system after all if an accident does occure who is liable for it? There are also some interesting ethical and philosophical questions that could be raised. For example if a driverless car is placed in a situation where an accident is unavoidable and its given a choice between either having a collision with party A, or B which one should it choose? Or if the only way to save a group of 5 or 10 people is to make a manuver which will almost certainly kill the driver should the car make that manuver if on the other hand not doing so would almost certainly guarantee the drivers safety but would possibly kill 5 people in the process.

I agree that the idea of a car driving itself is really cool and would be benificial to humanity, but a fully automated car just won't do. A car that moves on its own all the time is bound to mess up, especially when there is something unforseen in the road like a car you have been tailing for awhile suddenly brakes to avoid hitting a deer anf you smash into the rear of his car because the computer couldn't react fast enough.

That is why I propose we make cars that are half automatic and halfhuman controlled. That would be great, imagine that same scenario, but this time instead of trusting the car to brake on its own, you stomp your foot on that brake and the car stops.

A8766C1690D5,"Driverless cars can have many different positive and negative aspects about it. Yet people only tend to look at the positive. A person's brain tends to ""shut-off"" after being told the good things that can come of something new, that they don't really hear the bad of the product. Salesmen use this same technique. Sure having a driverless car can have some purcks, it is still just a acciedent on wheels.

What is really the point of owning or even making a car that doesn't allow the driver to even drive? Especually when there are so many things that would have to change in order to make room for the new vehicle. The law was originally made and planned out for cars that are originally driven by humans, but once you get a car that can drive itself, then those laws will have to change. In paragraph 9 it clearly states that ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will need in order to cover liability in the case of an accident"". It proves that the laws would have to change, not only for traffic safety, but also what would and should happen in case one of those driveless cars were to malifunction and cause a serious accident. Even then who would be at fault? ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, then who is at fault?"" The manufacturer could be the at fault if it had to do with the malifuntion of the car's interior of the engine. Or it could be the driver's fault if he or she didn't properly check their car's buttons.

Yet the car would still be able to control itself so that the driver is allowed to do many other things. In the case , to say, that the driver has been drinking that night and is in no way in shape to drive for a certain amount to drive. The car can ""handle driving functions of at speeds of 25 mph... they can steer, accelerate, and even break themselves"" (paragraph 7). This just shows the car's many capabilities of what it can do. Also the car has a feature that can allow the driver to turn of the autopilot and allow the driver to take control in case it is needed. Since ""the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern"" (paragrph 8). This goes to prove that drivwers are safer in this type of car.

As safe as the car may seen, It can be a real challenge to not only operate it, but also it can just be a rea challenge in itself. Dr. Werner Huber, who is a BMW project manager, admits that ""the psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way"" (paragraph 8). Even a BMW manager admits it's a challenge to handle such a car. Plus should the resoncibility of controlling a vehicle really be taken away from the people? Those who are learning or know how to drive should know that they should never have the privilage to be on the cell phone. People need to learn that their actions-such as drinking and driving or texting-do have concequences that they should learn from. In paragraph 8 it states how ""something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone"". Well that is something that no one should be doing in the first place. No wonder it wasn't available to drivers before.

Driveless cars should not be driven at all do to the fact that there are just to many risks that are being taken when such a car is being driven on the road. It just creates immature and irresponsible people and is too much of a hassle to deal with. Even for the Government. That is the reason why some states in the U.S. are making it illegal to even test the computer driven cars.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
494E74E149B0,"Technology involving computers, smartphones, and even cars are slowly but surely taking over our lives. Cars are one of the most purchased and used items of our world and without owing a vehicle or having other means of transportation, life would practically be hard. The world around us is constantly changing and with change comes new and fresh ideas. One of the new ideas that is thought to help improve our lives are driverless cars. Driverless cars (also known as taxis) are cars that can drive themselves around while the passengers are at rest as they wait to arrive at their destination. Although driverless cars sound exciting and fun, are they really? These new driverless cars are not completely driver-less, take the fun out of driving, and will cause several issues down the road dealing with accidents and injuries.

Google has created cars that are driverless and that can drive themselves under certain conditions. However, these cars are not completely driverless. Driverless cars tell the driver to take over the wheel when the car itself cannot perform human driving skills. Such as pulling in and out of driveways,going through accidents and construction sites,and on certain roads and streets. Driverless cars can acccelerate, steer, and brake themselves but overall these cars are still not completely driver-less. The point of having a driverless car is being able to simply enjoy not having to drive, not wait until it is your turn to take over the wheel.

Take a look around you. We have smartphones, computers, and even elevators to help make our lives easier. Studies have shown that the country that has the highest obesity levels and that also happen to be the laziest are Americans. Technology is the creation of something that helps make doing ordinary tasks easier and according to many doctors these new inventions involving computers and phones have made us more and more lazy. So what's next ;cars that drive themselves? What happened to taking a drivers test at the age of 16 and praying that you passed ? What happened to the thrill of being able to drive your parents car (legally) for the first time? Is that now going to be taken over by these new driverless cars? Driverless cars would in fact take the fun out of driving.

Overall driving has become the worlds' ""norm"" for our way of living. Yes, having a car that can assist you while driving would be very helpful, but having a car that drives for you would not. In that case, what would be the point of owning a car when you could instead call a taxi? Everyday our world is changing. Ideas and inventions are growing bigger and better by the second. Driverless cars are smart and creative inventions but cars were created to help make our lives easier;not live our lives for us.                       ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Today in our world of driving there are many people that don't care about the security of our kids and their ownselves. Many Adults and teenagers are always on their phones distracted from the road and putting theirself in danger. Especially teenagers, teenagers are the most irresponsible on the road today. A lot of teenagers like to go party and get drunk. Well unfortunately for us that is a big problem for drivers and parents. Teenagers drive drunk and text on their phones while driving. Well with Cars that dont need drivers, Teenagers will be safer more than ever instead of putting their life and someone else's in danger.

In Conclusion, if we have cars that don't need drivers, teenagers will be less likely to get in a car accident, and aldults including teenagers won't be on their phones because they're not driving. So if we had driverless cars today there would be less accidents, deaths, and we could also save money on gas.    ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
466992CF855A,"If it was possible for people to get driven around, majority of the people will ask how. With advanced technoloy and the development of driverless cars people would only need to drive if they wanted to. Driverless cars are being tested to drive safely with the help of all kinds of sensors. Driverless cars can help prevent a lot of accidents and dangers on ther road.

Most accident happen because adults and young adults are constanly texting and driving or they are checking things on social media. Most of the time when people hear a sound notifying them of nonification they are quick to respond to it. With help of driverless cars you will be able to do that and won't have to worry about watching the roads much.

Since the cars will be driverless automobile companies are testing out diferent types of sensor and how they are going to work for the car. Toyota Pruis is using sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera attached close to the rearview mirror,four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motion sensor. Even though sensors are already used for car, they are being developed better so they can do more specific things. Companies are testing the driverless cars with the new advance sensors to help improve our road systems.

Although the driverless cars are going through diferent tesing to avoid dangers on the road, companies realized that people will have to be ready to take over at any time. Most of these cases would happen if there was a car accident and the car would need help to safely get around the accident or when pulling in and out of drive ways. Eventually people will think about getting a driverless car.

Driverless cars sounds great and all but people will still have to pay attention at times. Car companies are trying to advance the driverless so much that when driven the car is not to much to hande. With the alerts from the the different sensors people when know when things are about to get bad. The sensors will also warn people when they are too close or if they are going to hit something. Soon everybody would be safe and happy in their driveress cars.                     ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E418CA5F2D7A,"Driveless cars are becoming a new idea and have been an experiment to try and make a perfect driveless car. Many different people have worked to come up with a flawless car that doesn't need a human behind the wheel. Although the idea is intriguing, i am not for driveless cars. There are many pros and cons of a drivelss car, however the cons out way the pros.

Pros of a driveless car: less human errors, uses half the fuel of today's taxis, far more flexibility, and they're just cool. Less human errors would occur since they wouldn't even have to touch the wheel in the first place. In the article it discusses how less fuel would be used which ulimately helps save our budgets and environment. More flexibility would occur because wherever you desire to be, your car would be able to tke you and pick you up. Now, driveless cars are just plain cool. Who wouldn't want a car to make all the decisions while you just relax until you meeet your destination? Although there are pros, the cons are just to great.

Cons of a driveless car: more accidents, not totally drivelss, disputes between manufactuerer and owner, expensive, too many chnages need to be made. Having a car that can drive for you is cool but the danger is just too high. The name of the car is very deceptive because to this day they aren't completely driveless, some still alert the driver when it is unable to drivve throug hcertain condidtions such as roadblocks or accidents. More accidents would occur because humans would rely on the automobile to drive itself when in fact the human must still be alert and awake. In paragraph 9 it discusses how there would be disputes between who would be responsible if the automobile system shut down. Should it be the manufacturer or the human in the car? Too man y laws would have to be instilled just because someone wants to make a new invention. Even with all these cons, the list could go on and on.

Many people would love to have a driveless car, however they wouldn't want all the risk and cons that come with a driveless car. The invention would be cool and unique, however it just isn't practical. In my opinion driveless cars should stay in movies and not be out on the streets. They are dangerous and there would be far too many disputes brought on by owning on. Driveless cars would indeed fundamentally change the world like the article implies, the change just wouldn't be for good.    ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E42790E7177D,"Driverless Cars is good way to help a driver when they are tired and they can take a break from the stairing wheel. The good thing about Driveless cars is that they can drive by themself under specific conditions. Google has had driveless cars that have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.

I think it's a good idea to make drivelss cars because it's interesting and this will help people out a lot especially when they are tired of staring the wheel and they need to sit back and relax, but I mean they will still be alerted to take over the wheel when they are dealing with traffic and accidents the care will warn them.

No matter what, theirs always going to be an accident and you can't blame the car for it, accedents happen and it can either be the other person in the other car or you. If you have a driveless car and you are taking a break but you still have the responsibility to stay on tract and have an eye on the road and not be texting it's still dangerous even though if it's a driveless car. Driveless cars can steer, acclerate and brake themselves but they are all designed to notify the driver when its neccasary.

Driveless cars can also help people who don't know how to drive it can help them out if the person is going to fast it can slow them down.

In 2016 Telsa is realeasing a car that is capable of driving outopilot 90% of the time. In 2020 their will be cars like Mercedes, Benz, Audi, and a Nisaan that will be alble to drive by themselves I think have driveless cars is a good idea. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
22B9F726FA89,"If people in the world can make a car capible of driving around elders, alchoholics, druggies, unmobilized, and more; that car deserves to be given a chance. The ""Driverless Car"" will reduce car crashes, gas, money on transit, and will be able to mobilize the unmobilized. People's lives around the world would change for the better; and that's why this car should be used.

There are hundreds of car crashes everyday around the world due to careless drivers. Using the ""Driverless Car"", crashes could be be significantly reduced if not gone. This car could also take a normal tank of gas and cut it in half. With these two benefactors, pollution would be drastically reduced due to less fumes in the air due to gas and leakage when a crash happens. These would all be important factors people have to think about when buying a car and they should want the one that has the power to help the Earth. In the reading the narrator tells the readers that ""He believes such cars would fundementally change the world.""

Using this car means that the average person can now save money on transit. Then people wouldnt have to spend as much money filling up the tank of their cars or spend half of their paycheck for a car payment just to get from point a to point b. The narrator exclaims to the readers that, ""He envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" If these cars start being used, buses would soon disapear; making the air safer to breath due to the Diesel gas and the pollution buses set off.

Lots of people who are not able to drive take the bus, this may be because in their town there are not taxis. There are people who are unmobilized due to not own a vehicle because they're too expensive; or that they could have a medical condition where they cannot drive. These people now will not have to worry about making it to the bus stop on time or making sure the bus is going where they need to be. People could then save time of being on a bus for an hour, to go somewhere 10 minutes away; and be able to be picked up at their doorstep and dropped off at their destination. The narrator tells the readers that, ""The cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

These cars would make the lives of everyone a lot more simple and efficient. Imagine a world with no traffic because there are no accidents; a world without pollution due to less gas use and buses, and a world where everyone has more money to spend on their families and on themselves. Unmobilized people could then feel more independant because they could then get themselves around. The world would be much better off using the ""Driverless Car"", it would be a perfect way to keep the Earth revolving.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Many people over the years have had sudden mishabs of something that wasnt there fault or maybe someone elses. driver less cars are starting to become very too expensive. Driverless cars are starting to mess with peoples mind, maybe having scensors and cameras everywhere along with automatic breaks but has anyone sat back and realzied how much this would cost. many people need to pay attention to whats going on, on the road and not just have a car do it for them.

82B3CF7114C7,"Most people who reach the age of 16 are elated to be able to learn how to drive. When they reach that point in their lives, they feel independent, responsible. They would not like to have that priviledge taken away from them. In fact, though most teens start to question authority more around the age of 16, they would do anything to stay out of trouble and would never risk the chance of having their driving priviledge revoked. Driverless cars would eliminate the entire experience of learning how to drive and all the pleasure one feels from it.

Driverless cars are an brilliant idea and would reduce the number of casualties and deaths that are caused by car accidents every year.

They would also, however, bring up new problems that would need to be solved. Not everyone would be able to afford a driverless car, as they would no doubt be extremely expensive, therefor not everyone would have one. If there were to be a mix of car types on the road, there would be the issue of accidents caused by cars with drivers. Would the person with the driverless car be considered faultless everytime just because it is assumed that the driverless car has everything under control? Would the person driving their own car be to blame because they should be responsible enough to watch where they are going and navigate the roads safely?

Another issue that would arise would be NASCAR. If driverless cars became the norm, what would be the point of racecars? Many people would lose their jobs because they had only worked in one position for a long period of time. The men and women in the pit stops would lose their jobs, as well as the drivers themselves. Companies that are funded by NASCAR would be in trouble as well because who would they have to help them out?

Driverless cars would eliminate some jobs, but also create some others. Companies that make computer-driven cars would have a ton of business, therefor increasing the employment rates. That also increases the chance of theft by the companies' employees. With the new demand of different, more expensive parts, employees would more than likely be tempted to steal from one company to help another if it meant a larger paycheck. Which ever company was doing the best would have to be extremely careful and might even have to hirer extra security to protect themselves and their products.

Driverless cars would both solve and cause problems in the future, should they become the norm. If not everyone could afford the new, expensive cars, who would be blamed for the car accidents that are bound to happen? Sports that include car racing, such as NASCAR, would be eliminated and thousands of people would be left without jobs and, potentially, on the streets. Though the new cars would create new jobs as well, they would also cause new thefts by employees in companies to better the flow of there income. Driverless cars would cause more problems than they would be worth in the long run.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
152858C2282B,"When i heard about driverless cars i was shocked that they really were coming up with such a thing , yeah its cool but at the same time it is extremely dangerous.

As you can see the automobiles are still having to alert the drivers ! How can it be a driverless car an still need assistance to get out of certain situations? I feel they shouldn't be realesed on the car lots, they can put many adults and children at risk.

The pasage states ''wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive."" The main concern is would the driver actually be alerted by the methods they have,when it's their turn to take control of the automobile. Also in the passage it states the car will look for any road trouble but will the car or driver be prepared for any kids darting across streets or any citizens on bikes .

I believe thats another reason why this car should not be realesed is because in the passage it says ''and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.'',''Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" There are to many flaws in these Driverless cars for them to get on the main roads just yet.

DB180FC0D3EB,"I think that the idea of driverless cars is terrible. I don't understand the point of it and why it's needed. Why would people need those cars if honesly the easiest and safest way is to just drive your own self? Technology is actually dangerous now and these days. I am against driverless cars being made for our future.

First off technology is extermely dangerous. Their are very many things being made right now that are exploding and seriously injuring people. Imagine what a driverless driver is capable of; such as recking, exploding, and or even just breaking down in the middle of whatever is going on. Who will be blamed if any of those happened? As it states in paragraph 9 ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"". Either way something wrong goes on and it's all because of the ""driverless car"".

Then the driving your own self is easiest way because you don't have to deal with all the malfunctions or any problems the driverless car has. Don't risk your safety for that driverless car, all it'll do is just cause problems for the people. It's a lot easier driving your own then having to turn off all the heads-up displays and then taking over to drive on your own. It exclaims that in paragraph 8 ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over..."". That is too much work when all you can do is just drive on your own not using any of that new technology. All that is just pure laziness.

The last reason on why the driverless cars shouldn't be made is because of your own safety. Your putting yourself at risk because you never know what can happen to the driverless car. As it states in paragraph 9 ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" It clearly states that human drivers should be in control at all times because it's the safest way and you aren't risking your life and safety for the car.

To conclude my arguement all i really have to say is don't risk your safety for this technology car that can't be trusted. I am against driverless cars being made for our future.        ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

This cars speed goes up to 25 mph, meanwhile in cars that we can drive go over 100 mph. This car can also notify the driver when the car needs to be taken control of. Vribrations are one of the notifications the car will give to you if there seems to be a problem with backing up into something. The Google car can announce itself when the car should be taken over. Flashing lights on the windshied is another way for notifying the driver. All of these simple, small notification symptoms are meaningless if you fall asleep while sitting in the car seat while your car is driving for you, This will be an all new crashing scale for the records.

Think of all of the possible ways that this manufacture driving car can cause so much harm. The casualties would be off the charts. Television shows have displayed a driverless car many times in the past, and people have yet to seem to realize that those are movies, not reality. Movies are works of art created by ones mind of imagination, If it's in a moive or in a show, then there should be a reason why it isn't real already. Not to mention the price. Having a driverless car would cost a lot of money. Why, you ask? They're new, rare, and there's a lot of sensors built into the car and a GPS reciever.

Driverless cars are dangerous because there's still a lot of mindless drivers out there in the world and driverless cars can simply comprehend the speed and damage another person can do within seconds. These types of cars and stop if there's something in the way behind the car. But what can the cars do when there's a speeding car coming right towards you? It can't drive and spin off somewhere.

For instance , Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. They aren't completely driverless, they send alerts to the driver to take over when things like a road block or an accident occurs. This just means the driver must remain alert at all times while in the vehicle. The driverless car is the same kind of function of an autopilot for a plane. While the driver is waiting for their turn to take over the wheel , it wont give them enough time to text, or use their phone. This can reduce the crash rate around the world.

Millions of people will die if you provide them with these cars. If you think harm is done only to you, then you are wrong. You can injure lots of people with only one lifeless car.

And this driveless car being controlled but not by its driver is a false fact. You will eventually drive it too. But this new experiment may be the cause of not returning to your home and giving your mom that nyquil that she wanted so badly because she was dying.

Driverless cars have been discussed and shown in television and movies, and this may become an everyday thing outside of Hollywood. This could change the world and our future drastically, however, is this a positive or a negative change? In this situation, the outcomes turn out to be more negative.

One example of negative change is that the cars would not be completely driverless. What is the point of a driverless car that is not ALWAYS driverless? Drivers would always have to be anticipating their turn to drive, which could cause stress and anxiety. During this time of waiting, drivers could get bored and find something to distract themselves with, such as a cell phone. By the time the car needs the driver to take control, they may not be fully attentive or ready. This could result in a crash or unsafe driving.

Next, safety is key when it comes to automobiles. Right now, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driver cars. Only California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have legalized testing driverless cars. Although more states may follow, traffic laws are very strict, and even if they change, new laws will be made in order to cover liability in case of an accident. Technology can fail, and if that were to happen, who would be responsible? The driver or the automaker? This could result in disagreements and chaos.

Finally, this could be expensive. Google has a modified Toyota Prius that contains position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camers mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motion sensor. This technology all works together to produce a 3-D model of the cars surroundings. If this car is not even driverless, how much technology would be needed for a driverless car? It could get very pricey.

Driverless cars are a new and upcoming idea. The results turn out to be more negative because of them not being completely driverless, the safety, and the price. This could change the future if they end up being produced. Technology leads to new discoveries every single day, and in a few years, we may be accustomed to not driving anymore.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless cars are not safe! The only way a car and the person in it are safe is if there is a human driver. In most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars. it is also very dangerous because whos to say that the care will funcation right all the time if there is not a human driver anything could happen. technology could go out and cause an accident. i just feel that sensors ans motions are not good enough to control a car we need actually people who can see and understand a car to be driviing at all times. also it could be not safe because whos to say that accident rates dont go up all becase driverless cars. Who would be in fault.

Who would be infault of an accident of a driverless car? That would be something hard to point the finger at the technology of the car could fail and lead to an accident. Whos fault would that be the driver or the manufacturer? If there was to be an accident the driverless car would not be able to talk or even tell its side of the story. it could even be hard to detect what casued the driverless car to be in an accident if that was the problem. Even for the human driving that hit the driverless car whos to say that they could afford the bill an insurance of hitting a driverless car. You would have to come up with who fault it was the human or the car. Humans reaming alert is also a problem.

If humans had to stay alert of a driverless car then they might as well driver it. Who can actually look out for such a car machine if something was to go wrong they woul need to fix it. in oder for that to happen you would need highly trained people to know how to control the driverless car.

There shouldnt be a car that can help you pull out of your drive way. The artical states that having driverless cars would be more efficant but what if its not what if there are more accidents in the US due to driverless cars then there is involving humans, it also states that it can help drive its self by accelerating itslef, braking, and steering. Humans need to be alert when behind the wheel. Driverless cars takes that away.

The automotive companies really need to think this desicion more thouroghly, because yes they would be making alot more money by coustomers buying the driverless cars but if the cars truly arent driverless like the artical says then one persokn is gonna think that its okay to fall asleep or something else and then BAM!! You have gotten in an accident and whos fault is it? Its your fault not the cars fault.

Yes driverless cars help with paying more attention but that should not be a reason to just do whatever you want behind the wheel because you thing its safe. The artical states that the BMW auto motive company had announced the development of "" Traffic Jam Assistant"" the car can only handle driving functions up to 25 miles per hour what will happen if an accident occurs of that speed limit?

0C134FFBB4D2,"i dont believe that driverless cars would be a good influence on our population. I say that because i dont think people would use these cars as good use. People wouldnt use these cars for good reason because they would take advantage of it because it can drive on its own, I know it would have a built in camera for our eyes on the road but lets just be real here noone will even take a glance at the road. These cars are really smart cars and all but what does this car do for us? I really think these cars wouldnt do us any good because none of us wouldnt want to drive anymore because it drives on its own therefore that would make us all lazy drivers. im sure these cars know alot but they probably dont know the importance of driving under roads that are under construction, or bad weather, slick roads. Which concerns me of all of our safety, and all our lives at risk. What if the roads are very slick and its foggy outside? i dont think the car can drive through that type of weather because at times it is very hard for us humans to drive under that condition.

Most of us have children and passengers while driving with us all the time i am very concerned of their safety too, what if they are not comfortable with these cars, they want you to take control of the wheel. We all have our opinions on things but these cars i really dont like the idea of it. Like money wise the cars would cost us millions probably for it and there are more important things in the world to buy, we really dont need to spend all our money on these cars. Gas money for these cars what if these cars use a lot of gas?

We would have to spend like another 80 to 90$ on gas too. The car what if the car alert system or camera stops working?

We have no other choice but to take the wheel, it shouldnt take all that money for a car and for something to happen to it and we have to end up driving it anyways, so we shouldnt even have this idea of these cars in my opinion its a waste of money. In conclusion i dont think it would be a good idea for us to have this new source of techinology because most of us wont even use it right and it could cause all kinds of problems.

4C70917BE924,"Drivelss cars should not be developed because they can cause accidents, they can cause the driver not to pay attetnion, and they would cost more.

Drivelss cars aren't really driveless. At certain points they will need the drivers assistance. This can lead to many accidents. In paragraph 9, the text states ""most driving laws focus on keeping dirvers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" The sentence proves that driveless cars may not be completely safe. The driver could depend on the car to drive itself and not be paying attention which can result in accidents. In paragraph 9, it also states that it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. Something would not be illegal if it's comepletely safe.

Another reason driveless cars should not be developed is becasue they can cause the drive not to pay attention. Driveless cars would be like phones. They made driving and texting illegal because it made the drivers not pay attention and caused many death and accidents. The same result can come form drivelss cars. They can be a great distraction becasue the driver would think that the car can drive itlsef and they would not pay attention. From that conclusion, in paragraph 9, the question ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer"" would come up. Who would be responsible? If the driver belived the car can drive itself and the techonology failed, it can lead to death because the driver might not be paying attention. The driver would think the car doesn't need a driver and when the techonology fails and the car spins out of control, many lives could be lost.

Driveless cars would also cost more money in many things. The cost to buy would most likely be more expensive. If drivelessc cars started being in use, there would need to be new signs that fit those specific cars. Driveless cars would aslo need specific shops and equipment. If something goes wrong you would need to get it fixed and the technology used makes it more expensive. Fixing a car is already expensive. You have to buy whatever it is you need to fix and then take it to a shop. If something in the techonology of a driveless car goes wrong and you need to get it fixed, it will denifitely cost more.

Causing accidents, causing the driver not to pay attention, and costing more are reasons why driveless cars should not be developed.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FBC72F5358BE,"I believe that driverless cars should not be built. They seem like a good idea at the first look but imagine there would be so many downsides to owning one of these vehicles. First of all they would be extremely expensive to build and buy and the delicate snesors used in these vehicles could easly be broken or damaged. Also people would have the ability to hack into the servers that would run these vehicles and essentially make them do whatever they wanted, whether it be to wreck or cause an accident. And what would happen if one of these vehicles were to malfunction and cause the death of a driver, passenger, or pedestrian. I feel there are too many risks and downsides to be producing these vehicles.

Even if we were to make these vehicles mainstream and sell them people would find something wrong with them like they always do. And if not that they would find ways around safety measures added to the vehicles. For example preasure sensors could be added to the steering wheel to only allow the cars to drive if someone has there hands on it, but someone could just tightly wrap tape or something else around the wheel instead and cause an accident. This is why I think these vehicles should not be produced and sold.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
C44019DF831B,"One big milestone in a person's teenage years is when they have to take a driver's test to get their license. Many people often become stressed behind the wheel during the driver's test because they are afraid of making mistakes. The people of our generation are just as nervous about these test as our older generations but what if that were to change in the future? What if, instead of driving cars where we have to be driving one hundred percent of the time, there were cars out there that allowed the car to do the driving for us? Many companies have been working on the idea of ""driverless cars"" in hopes that they will reshape the whole concept of driving. However, that does not mean they are a good thing. Driverless cars should not be used in the future because they could take away the focus of the driver, the future generation wouldn't know about driving basics, and they are illegal in some states.

First of all, they could take away the focus of some drivers. As these driverless cars are being invented, they allow drivers to meerly sit back in the drivers seat and enjoy the road. Sitting for thirty minutes in a car will not be enough to satisfy the boredom of some people. There are people out there who can not deal with sitting in one place for a few minutes and have to do something to keep them busy. Therefore, their focus could easily move to something else other than the road, like a fellow passenger or at the scenery around them. Driverless cars are not entirely driverless. As said in the article, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" What if the driver is not prepared to take over when the situation requires? These new cars may have features of notifying an individual when they need to take over but if they are not ready because they were focused on something else, then the results could be disastirous. This is why it takes away focus from drivers.

Next, the future generation would not know about driving basics. Many teenagers today have to take drivers ed classes as they attempt to obtain a license from the BMV. But what would future generation drivers have to go through for their driving exams if we have driverless cars. As stated before, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. The newer generations still have to learn to basics of driving even if they will be driving in a driverless car in the future. If this does not happen, then they could be in trouble if their driverless cars malfunction or they are forced to drive a regular car instead. The future generations will probably not know about the driving basics because they will think they are too far advanced for it. For example, not many people know how to drive ""stick"" or even know what that means even though it was vital for driving long ago. If someone were to enter a car that needed that kind of function, they would not know what to do. And the same thing applies to future generations if they would not know the driving basics.

Finally, these vehicles are against the law in some states. According to the article, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control ata all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" With the government concerned about the safety of a driver behind the wheel, they will not allow driverless cars on the roads. The safety of the people is more important than to advancement of technology. Until the driverless cars have been updated to the time where they are safe for everyone, there is no way that driverless cars will be seen on the roads with regular cars for quite some time. This is why driverless vehicles are against the law in some states.

In conclusion, driverless cars should not be used in the future because they take away the driver's focus, the future generations need to learn about the driving basics that we use today, and it is illegal to use computer-driven cars. Of course, in the future, new technology will arise to give people more mobility and ways of transportation but that will not happen until everyone is safe. Many individuals are in car crashes every year from lack of focus on the road. Driverless cars can add to this problem just like any other and until we have to tools necessary to ensure they safety of the people using driverless cars, there is no way that they will be seen among the streets.

9022E3076084,"I'm against driverless cars and trucks. I'm against driverless cars on the road because everyone woud have to buy the car at the same time or this wouldn't work.

This wouldn't work because the first half of people who get the driverless car will be safer. But then the half that doesn't have the smart car will run to the smart car and we are still back to square one. As it says in the story ""sensors are nothing new."" Sensors are always going to fail there is no way to stop technolgy from failing on point in time. Everything is too new. When one of the parts need replaced on these smart cars its going to cost a fourtne to fix. You already see how with all the technolgy in our cars now its getting to expensive to fix. The problem is the flaw is that they are going to have to keep updating cars and maps in the cars so the car to know the fastest way to the destination. Also if there is unexpected road work it will be try to go right threw the road work and i dont see that working.

The next problem i invision is that all the laws will have to be changed to meet the critera of the car. This will in a way force the people who dont want to buy a smart car to have to buy one. As stated in paragraph 9 the car are not reliable enough for the laws to get changed.

This is not a safe idea at all because there will always be that one parent that who will program there car to do something for the child and they will expect the car to get to that destination safely. But the risk of a malfunction is very great. The parent doesn't see the risk until it is too late and the child is either hit by another motorist or the car malfunctions and the kid runs into something and the car has gotten wrecked. I also don't feel like it should be the manufacturers fault for the stupidity of the parent.

Another problem is that if a person wants to stop at some where or at a gas station for a snack or for a restroom break they can't. They can't because the car was only programed to go to that certain place. So in other words you would have to go to the destination then turn right around and go to the gas station or store.

As of right now i still think that humans are way more reliable than technolgy. I feel like there will always be accidents. There is no way of stopping people from running in to each other at least once in the cars lifetime. You need alot more research fome me to go along with the idea of having smarter cars.

Sure the driverless cars are going to have advanced technology and have a ton of motion sensors on the body of the cars but all that technology, including the crucial sensor on the roof of the car that constantly processes 3D images around the car's body can cost millions of dollars to produce.

The cost to manufacture the cars aren't the only problem, The psychological aspects contribute to the driverless car aswell stating that the fact that drivers may get bored when they aren't driving. The drivers could also doze off to sleep and miss all the warning displays about the car needed to be taken over by the driver which can lead to more accidents.

Driverless cars are also illegal to test in some states becuase the safety of the public is concerned. The hardware in these cars can easily fail and traffic laws will need to change in order who will be the one to blame if the car malfunctions- either the manufactuer or the driver. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that a car can olnly be safe if a human driver has total control. The advanced technology can throw the driver and the manufacters through a loop, which may result that the whole situation will turn into a mess and the manufacturers will be sued because the driverless cars didn't meet the highest standards for pedestrian safety.

Yes, having an extra pair of eyes in the car is very usefull when backing out or to prevent an accident thanks to the automatic brakes and sensors, but being in a car that is driverless can be very dangerous if the driver is not alert and prepared to take the wheel when there is a work zone ahead. Also the driverless cars may be very expensive because of all the technology that is enhancing the safety features.

First, I think driverless cars shouldn't be relsed becuase there still to dangerous. The passage states that, ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This means you can't trust the car driving by itself because it's not ready to be driven by itself yet. A human still has to take alert when they're backing out. Another reason I think driverless cars are to dangerous to be relesed is because they might not have everything it takes to drive by itself.

Second, I think driverless cars shouldn't be relesed because they are to exspensive. The passage says, ""Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motaion sensor."" Having all of these sensors and be very exspenvise. And many people might not have the money to replace them if they get broken.

Finally, Having driverless cars relesed can take up to much time. In the passage, it states, ""There was no way, before 2000, to makesomething interresting. The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there , and the mapping wasn't there. Radar weas a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.""

I envision cats being used with less gas and being much more functional than other public transportation systems. Driverless cars were an option that was invented because the option of ideal roads were objectified, leaving only the option for smart cars. Smart cars perphaps are definitely seen as ""Smart Cars"" because they have apparent anneminities such as sensors that further promote the name of a ""Smart Car."" The spinning sensor on the roof of some smart cars is an ideal invention that is an important part of what makes a smart car smart. The combination of sensors allow the smart car to mimic the skill of a driverless car. Sensors have become more advanced allowing for a significant signal of apparent danger which in some cases is btweer than what a human can do alone. Sensors add for a safer and more productive car which has the qualities of keeping drivers and other passengers safe.

Smart Cars also have the capability of obtaining the antilock brakes. Sebastian Thurn believes that the technology of this generation compared to generations before us have come a long way, and that before Smart Cars, the was interesting qualities of cars we used before Smart Cars such as the absence of sensors, computers, and navigation.

The ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" was invented in 2013 which allowed the car to handle navigating at speeds higher than 25mph. This invention was a breakthrough, but also allowing for the driver to maintain control at all times. The ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" allows for the car to be capable of practically driving itself but also allows for the driver to take control in areas where humans are necessary for driving.

Cameras, drivers seats that vibrate when a vehicle is in danger, and flashing lights on windshields see all components that are possible to add to the already sustainable Smart Cars to make them more interesting, effective, and productive.

AFB2995F886F,"So in my opinion, I am definantely for the development of driverless cars.

I find they will be useful in the future for these reasons: 1) They will most likely cause less wrecks. 2) The will probably be safer for the community. 3) They might bring new ideas to the table.

I find that these three reasons will bring a positive outlook on driverless cars. I do however have one problem with driverless cars: carelessness, but i will explain my reasoning later.

I think driverless cars will be the future.

So as i said in my first reasoning, they will most likely cause less wrecks.

I say this because if everyone had a driverless car, the the programming in the cars will mostlikely correspond with each other and (in my thinking) they will react to each other as they get close to one another to prevent any damage that comes up.

This leads to my second reason why i think thety should keep working on driverless cars, it ill probably be better for the community.

Like i said, if the cars can correspond and react to each other, thanthey will have a greater chance of not hitting each other and causing less injuries to cars, the driver and passengers, and pedestrians.

This could definantely decrease injuries by cars per year and could possibly save thousands upon thousands of lives.

This is of course a goos thing and if driverless cars could prevent this, then i'm pretty sure anyone would approve and want this car.

Now my second reason for why driverless cars is a good idea and should be promoted is because this might bring new ideas to the table of creativity if you want to call it.

The reason i say this is because if they can create cars that drive on their own without human needs, then this might spark some new ideas for new inventions (doesn't have to all be car related in my opinion).

Like they could be at the verge of creating inventions that people might have never thought of before.

Now i know it does seem like that i'm getting a bit off track about the driverless cars thing, but for a second, just imagine all the possibilities that could come out of driverless cars and their technology.

This could bring about ideas one could only dream about.

This could be a serious change to the world as it is if companies can bring fully driverless cars to the world.

Now for the reason why I think that driverless cars might not be a good idea in the first place: carelessness.

Now what I mean by that is mostly two reasons: 1) problem with the technology.

2) Problem with the person behind the wheel.

About the problem with technology, If the company who makes the car provides a misshap with the technology they used to make the car, then there might be a problam when time passes along while driving the car.

Like there could be a miscommunication with the cars (Assuming that everyone has a driverless car with the same or somewhat similar technology that correspond with each other.), there could be a problem with the way it works if not made the way it should be, and the list could go on forever.

Now to the other negative of this reason, the person who is behind the wheel of the driverless car.

What I mean is that the person who is behind the wheel of the driverless car could cuase a problem with the inside or outside of that car like: Mess around with the controls, damage a part of the car through human or nature contact, shortage of a wire or battery or whatever is in or out of the car, and this list has almost unlimited downsides to it, but hopefully you understand my point.

So as I said, driverless cars in my opinion will become the future if made at all.

There is a certainty at the rate this world is going today because people these days have many ideas to come.

I know that there will be more problems to come, but as the saying goes ""There is always a solution to every problem"", and i think that people or companies that are creating this type of machinery knows that there will be new problems that they will have to overcome.

38CD6004BEFE,"The autonomous car- a dream of many people for years on years, but it seems that the time has come. We today have the technology and ability to make it happen. Though it may seem marvelous and a load off of the drivers shoulders, maybe taking a deeper look would be beneficial. Is it really as great of an idea as it seems?

Autonomous cars, or self driving cars, have truly been around since 2009 with the company Google. What may suprise people is that these cars do not completely control themselves. There still has to be a person alert and ready to take control at any given moment. The technology for these vehicles is very advanced, but they cannot maneuver through construction sites or back out of drive ways. As amazing as these vehicles are in theory, what is the use of a SEMI-self driving car?

Not only do humans have to be armed and ready to hop to the wheel (or in some cases, keep their hands planted on the wheel at all times), there is never any guarantee that the technology will not fail. If one of the cars were to fail, it would more than likely cause a large wreck and injure at least the driver. Not only is it a safety concern, but also the relationship between the buyer and seller is compromised. If someone were to be injured in a car that was supposed to keep them safe, who is responsible? Is it the blame of the company or the owner of the vehicle?

As many know, technology can only do what it is programmed to do. A computer cannot console you when your cat dies, neither can an autonomous car make spurt of the moment decisions on what to do. In situations such as somebody quickly pulling out in front of you, the car would slow down too quickly or possibly completely come to a stop. That could cause many safety hazards to the driver and the people around them. If presented with a different, more severe situation, who knows what could happen?

Though there may be some pros to having an autonomous car, they do not out weigh the cons of it. It is far too much of a safety concern to have driverless cars on our roads. Just like people, technology can make mistakes or fail. The idea of driverless cars should be abandonned, for they do not propose any true benefits.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

6262ED336DBD,"Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. To support my reasonings would include what Google cofounder Sergey Brin has developed and thought about. The cars that he foresees would use half the fueld of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. Secondly would be that of the Toyota Prius that uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel which would allow you to estimate how far away or close you are to a curb or another vehicle. Lastly would be the safety that the car would be capable of.

The first reason behind my opinion is that it would be less cost effective in the long run which means that over time, you will get your money back from the car. The manufacturers have thought of a way to allow the car to drive and think for itself and allowing the driver to relax until they get notified that they should take control. Cars that are smarter will allow you to save more money and cost less mechanically, as well as save on fuel.

Secondly, would be sensors and displays in the car that allow you to focus on the task at hand when you are driving. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver said, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" In the car that he is overseeing, it uses heads-up displays and information systems that will notify you of an accident ahead or a roadblock that calls for a detour. The displays can be automatically turned off which is something not available to drivers who are texting and driving. Another detail would be that of manufacturers consideration of using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention if he or she needs to take control of the car. If the driver is paying attention to the road, then he will not need to be notified and or have the company of that car be notified. It allows the driver to pay closer attention to the road and not his surroundings.

Lastly would be that of safety. Safety is a number one priority in cars and in life as a whole. If your car is safer to drive on the highway, it will reduce the cause of accidents and save you and others around you money. That is why manufacturers are considering using displays that will automatically turn themselves off so that the driver does not get distracted behind the wheel and cause a serious accident. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, which would then notify the driver that they are too close to an object and that they should stop immediately and look at their surroundings. All of the little gadgets that are put into this car as well as other cars, are allowing the driver to pay better attention to the road and the objects around him. Cars are getting smarter by the year which is reducing the number of accidents per day. Which is why driverless cars are a must for safety.

The reasons stated above show how and why that driverless cars are a must for everyday life as we know it. They save you money by not having to pay so much for gas everytime you have to fill up. The car is being driver by the hardware that is inside of it and it will notifiy if you need to take over and steer. The last reason is safety. If the car is not safe, it should not be on the road. Driverless cars are allowing the driver to pay closer attention to the road as well as what is happening around him better than if he had all the lights in his face and his phone placed in the cup holder or in his lap. The driverless car is being developing to become something greater and more useful for everyday human life. This shows how and why driverless cars are a must for everyday life and why I agree with the developement and manufacturing of these cars. ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
AFBEA4BA2D3C,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" The author stated both positive and negative stances on the topic of driverless cars. This topic is very controversial when bringing in the aspect of safety and the well-being of others around the driverless car. And, because of that I believe driverless cars are not a good idea to bring into society.

First, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel. In the text it stated that ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't(7). Which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again. But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless. No one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive""(8). And the most important question is, what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving. They could distract theirselves with their phones, music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation. This is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in. Missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians. And, this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits.

Second, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen. In the text it explained how new laws would have to be created to go along with the cars when they are proved to be ""more reliably safe""(9). But what would happen ""If the technology fails and someone is injured""(9). This issue could cause many lawsuits filed against innocent ""drivers"" and many lawsuits filed against companies who were not aware of the issue with the cars technology. Sometimes things happen and because technology can not be trusted 100% of the time these cars should not be able to exist. Lives could be on the line and many people who were not to blame will take the blame for this mishap. The car could just cause a million more problems instead of solving the laziness of humans will not to want to drive.

Lastly, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked. Anything in the world could be hacked. Anyones phone can be hacked, computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked. So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction.

These examples of recklessness, misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea. They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good.

5938A1C7C8EE,"Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you can be in a car with no driver? Well that may become a reality very soon. I believe that the idea for a self driving car can cause a lot of problems from who is responsible in a crash to how can the manufactures make the cars as safe as possible. There are three main ideas that may have you thinking next time you get behind the wheel. Those are how the cars need someone inside when driving, how they might not need someone inside in the future and how they can signal a passanger to assest f something were to go wrong.

The self-cars most likely need a driver today because of road blocks, construction, or any road problems that might cause the car to crash and not be able to manuver out of the way of the obsticals. The cars also need a driver because if the manufacures were to put the self driving car on the market then not a lot of people will buy it from it costing too much or they just think it's ridiculous. Also if a driver were to crash into a self-driving car and there was no-one in the driver seat then there would be some problems like how the driver would say that it was the cars fault just to get some extra money from the car company.

There also might be a way to alert the driver on stand-by to assest the car. If the car has a DVD player or televison screen and if there is an accentident about to happen, then the car can either shut down the devise or flash on the screen about the danger. The driver might be able to gain control over the situation. Also, if the driver does not have a screen and is using a cell phone as entrainment, then there could be lights instaled under the rear-view mirror and can flash when sensors detect danger.

Now lets say that it is a decade or two from the inital launch of the driving car and about everyone has one. then maybe there wil be no reason for a driver to be present when driving. There are some cars out there with sensors around it to tell the driver to move out of the way of an incoming car. Well I believe that it is possible to have it to where the sensors tell the computer on board the vechicule to move out of the way, eleminating the middle man. Also if there is road constuction then there might be a way to tell all of the cars about it so that they know about where to go and how to get around it.

I believe that it is possible to have a self driving car but it will take a long time. There will be trail and error along side it. But I believe that it is possible, from all of the technical advancements that have been accomplished over the years, i dont see a problem with a self driving car.

there are some postive and negative aspects of the diverless cars such as Sensing the world, Driving and assisting the driver, but beside that should we or not have driverless cars.

We should have driverless cars. Diverless cars are easy to use and any age group can use them. The cars can sense and warn the driver about the dangers and that will increase the safety of the drivers. In the article it states that "" Futher improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make drving safer are also leading to cars that ca handle more and more drving tasks on their own."" In this line it tells us that these cars will handle more than just driving. In fact it will also take care of the safety of the driver.

Do we really need driverless cars. Is technology taking over. If we really think about it do we even need driverless cars. If we have cars that don't need drivers to drive them that means some peoples will be out of there jobs. So does it mean in the future the cars will make humans more lazy and jobless.

No, we don't need driverless cars, because we are making people more careless. In the article it states "" The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" In this line it tells us that the car will mimic the skill of a human. Who will asure us about our safety in the car. Who will we blame for the technology. In the article it states "" laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" In this line it tells us that we still need laws that will cover the liability in case of a accident and one more thing to think about who will take in charge of the accident the car company or the driver if an accident happens.

In conclusion, there are some negative and postive aspects of driverless cars such as who will take in charge of an accident. An negative aspects of driverless cars is that if those cars come in the market, what will happen to the drivers who drive the cars and earn from driving an car such as taxi drivers. An postive aspect will be that the new driverless cars will insure the safety of the passengers and they will not be distracted. So there are many good and bad aspects of driverless cars.

7BCEA1F17A50,"Driverless Cars are the furture of the automoblie. No crashes have happened to googles smart cars so far. They take up less gas, saying ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" Those are just two of many reasons why driveless cars are going to change America.

The small amount that driverless cars have actully driven there hasn't been one issue with crashing into other objects. Yes there are still bugs that still need to be fixed. The cars can not at this time pull out or pull in a driveway, they also can not tell when road work is happening or when there has been a crash on the road. All things when they first start are a little bit buggy but that doesn't mean in two to five years that things could get fixed. When those bugs do get fix we could see a crashless world.

In the artical they are talking about a driverless taxi's sevice, that is more cost friendly and more flexable than the buses. Gas isn't high cost like it use to be but when you're driving people from one part of town to another side, the gas bill started to stack up. Driverless cars always take the shortest route and are just more gas friendly then your average taxi. Cutting that gas bill in half will safe more money to put back into your company or the communtiy. Gas had always been in high demand the driverless car could stop that.

The only thing keeping us from those driveless car in the laws and the bugs that they do have but again in two to five years both of those could have change the way we see cars forever.

8EB7CE98B8EA,"The driverless car seems like an interesting invention that could possibly keep drivers safe and form good habits, but what if it just makes the problem worse?

The driverless car is new to us and it might give us a hand on the road. There is also the possibility that the cars malfunction or don't respond to commands. These cars are part of the age of technology and we all know that it's not always helpful.

Smart cars take a long time to assemble and adjust to. With all of the sensors, motion sensors, and a GPS, there hass to be something on the car that hasn't been looked over. The GPS has to update to be aware of it's own surroundings. That may seem like a handy feature but GPS's aren't always right and this could lead to trouble.

The sensors in the car are able to detect danger on the roads but they can only detect a certain distance away. In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels to detect out-of-control skids and rollovers. They have advanced to be able to signal the brakes when this happens. These operations stilll need improvements though.

The big problem nowadays is texting and driving. The roads are a lot more dangerous with people constantly getting distracted on the road and this has caused many injuries and deaths. Now how would a car that can operate itself, help to get rid of these habits? The answer is, they don't! Allowing drivers to take it easy on the roads and be lazy isn't going to help anything. Adding alarms to the car can lower accindent rates but people shouldn't need to be alarmed of danger. Driver's should be watching the roads like a hawk does it's prey. Adding safety features can only do so much to keep someone safe. What is needed most is a feature that can break these habits of bad drivers. ""Some manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.""

That's actually a good thing to make sure people behave right when driving. If the driver forms better habits, then we wont have a thing to worry about. Sensors to detect pedestrians and other cars coming provide better transportation and lower accident rates. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe."" With these new advancements to personal transport, we are making the world a little safer.

That doesn't mean that we saved the world from the apocalypse or anything.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

There is really no point to having a driverless cars because, you as the driver, or ""passenger"" still has to stay alert when the driverless cars are is either around accidents or traffic jams.

The dream of not having to actually drive your car something every driver dreams about. Mainly because of the responsiblity and stress that is placed on your shoulder as you get into that drivers seat. Whether you're an inexperienced driver or not this could be very beneficial.

Not only do you have to be cautious of other drivers but you have to remained focused on the road. So for a student driver, or perhaps an elder who may be too impaired with medication to drive, this driveless car could benefit them. This could lower the emotional strain you have about grandma not seeing that vehicle pull out in front of her or your child crashing into another driver because they may have been texting.

For a driver education vehicle, I think this could be a good teaching device. If you look at all of the accidents that have happened while in the process of learning the rules of the road cpuld save a lot of lives. The benefits of the car, such as knowing how close you are to bumping into another vehicle, could help someone who maybe parrelle parking. The vehicle will know if you are too close to the curb you are, or may parrallel park for you!

So, in conclusion, what is my position on driverless cars? I support the idea of this vehicle however, referring to my first statement, I don't think we will ever have a vehicle that is completely driverless. Even if a computer takes over your driving, you still have to watch the road and navigate, as said in paragraph 7 of the article.

Yes, the fantasy of having a completely driverless car seems like a good idea for drivers, and teen drivers such as myself, but this could result in people revolting against the safe regulations required when you're required to follow when behind that wheel. Why wouldn't anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't they get bored waiting for their turn to drive? No, they wouldn't they still need to take caution to the road and be prepared to break, turn, and accelerate just incase the computer doesn't do it for them!

While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. They will go about thinking that the technology has everything under control. Forgetting that cars that require drivers have difficulties. Yet they will trust a car to drive itself and have no problem? The car you are driving could have miscalculations and make a turn where there is a building!

When in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond.

Do you want your life to depend on the driving of a robotic car? Although there would be reasons as to why these cars are useful, they aren't guaranteed to work. Driverless cars are dangerous because they are prone to malfunction, don't have a way to react quick enough, and is blind to certain things on the road.

Everything that is controlled by itself or some sort of robot is prone to malfunction. A car driven by humans is already dangerous enough! If one of these driverless cars was to malfunciton, the one to blame is the manufactorer. With the malfunctioning cars there will be conflict between an individual and the manufactorer. Not only does it cause conflict, but it could cause great damage to our society.

Most robotic things are quick, but they are not quick enough to react to something happening in half a second. If a driverless car were setup to react to an incoming car, it would just try to swerve around the car. If the car just swerves and there is another car on the left or right of it, the car would then hit one of those. If the driverless car just breaks to avoid hitting a car in front of it, and the car behind it does not have enough time to react and crashes into him.

First off this will obviously be overwehlmingly expensive and will be very time cosumming. Right now people should not be thinking about these expensive plans because roadways today are still atleast somewhat reliable. considering this will require many years of work, and ruin the routes for people making it unconvenient for some that have daily routines to get around to sum up their day.

The biggest problem that I see is money and how much something like this could very well cripple our economy, obviously the other problems are serious like getting the amount of people necessary to do something this bold. Dont get me wrong it can solve the shortage of jobs and could get people off the streets and give chances to those less fortunate and could also pay extremely well. At the same time aswell, what happens to the workers after they are done with the roads. They could possibly end up without more jobs after the fact and the prices in the economy in my mind will have shot up.

I also think its a bad idea because of where the money might be coming from. My biggest opinion is that it will possibly be coming out of the tax payers and this will bring a domino effect of poverty because the jobs people work for might not be able to keep up with the amount of money coming out of their employees checks. This could for sure bring a huge downfall in America's economy.

Time in my opinion will also not be on anybody side because it would be reguired for all streets, backroads, interstate highways, and country roads internationally to be remanufactured. Maybe even surrounding countries like Canada and Mexico might have to adapt to the big change in roads. This would also trickle down all the way into south america and maybe be impossible for some places to obtain the funds or resources to make these things happen.

These reasons in my opinion are very clear and understanable to most because of the situations countries go through on a daily baises.

Driverless cars are just what the name states, cars without a need to have a driver present. This could be a big part of our futures but whether it will help our future drivers or hurt them is the main importance. Personallly I do not think that driverless cars are going to do more harm than good to our furture drivers.

Today to get your drivers lisence you have to hold a permit for one-hundred eighty days and have to pass a writen test followed by a driving portion of the test with an instructor. These conditions you have to follow to be able to drive a normal car are intense because you are being put onto a road that could potientionally harm another humans life or your own life. The precautions you have to take are endless while driving and the risk you are putting yourself in is immense.

Having driverless cars where you still have to be in control part of the time just causes an even bigger distraction especially for younger, newer drivers. You could be talking and suddenly have to stop manually and not have enough time to make it there, because you were distracted by something else.

Another reason that driverless cars have a negative effect on the future is the economy. To make a normal car cost a lot of money but to make a driverless car would cost twice that or more because of the type of technology you would need to use to make them run proporley.

Having normal cars puts your life into harms way and teens are bad enough when it comes to staying focused, being attentive,and staying cautious with normal cars. By putting teens behind the wheel of cars that uses a computer, or a controling device to run it, is teaching them nothing but pure laziness, not to focus your one hundred percent attention, and to stay alert when it comes to driving.

Driving is a very serious matter that people already abuse laws and regulations for. To give people another excuse to why the accident happened or to why they wrecked into a pole should not come from our local car dealerships and manufacturers. We together as a community need to stop the driving problems directly and not give people more advanced technology, just so they have another excuse as to why an accident occured.

Others may agree to have driverless cars but I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars it may be safe to other but it is not safe to me because I wouldn't want to have a wreck driving in a driverless car. It is good to have motion sensored cameras on the back and front of some vehicles but it is not good to have a car that parks itself because you could maybe put the car in to driverless mode it may cause a wreck or crash while the car is parking or driving on it's own. it is not good to have antilock brakes either bc you could be on your way to work and your coming to a yellow light that is turning red you may not be paying attention and not have your seatbelt on and the car just brakes on it's own it could cause serious and major injuries to you or anyone else who may be in the car with you.,2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
CEB2127CDFEC,"I am against the idea of drverless cars. Technology is making our nation lazy. We have computers that think for us, radios that can read for us, calculators that count for us, and now we are creating cars that drive for us. It's unacceptable how we as a nation depend so heavily on technology to do everything for us. If technology is taking over everything, I would atleast love to keep my ability to drive. Driverless cars isn't such a brilliant idea anyway. Before we really begin to consider using this new advancement in transportation we should think of the best ways to insure safety. For instance with driverless cars how can we be sure that the person in control of the car won't feel the need to text and drive; if there is a malfunction in the car and the driver isn't eligible to respond in time to avoid an accident it can lead to many deaths or injuries. In driverless cars I'm guessing they would run on electricity, if the car short circuits and catches fire with a passenger inside, how can the manufacturer create a way for the passenger to exit the car before it exploids. The article stated that driverless cars are not completely driverless, they still need assistance from a human to take control during traffic issues such as an accident. The article also stated that safety is best achieved with alert drivers, making a car that drives for the driver makes it more of a challege for the driver to find a reason to stay alert. I believe the idea should hold off until we have a way to make sure there aren't any real concerns of safety. At the rate that technology is advancing I am more than positive that we will have driverless cars before the turn of the century. But I feel as though we are trying to walk before we crawl, we are missing important steps that will make sure driverless cars are necessary. There are still laws that need to be passed, and how do we know that driverless cars won't in some way negatively affect the regular cars that people who can't afford driverless cars.

EE54DEFF4571,"Driverless cars are swiftly becoming a viable possibility for the near future. They are capable of outperforming many human drivers, as well as being able to return control to the driver in the case of a more complex situation that requires more thought than the car can handle. This duality is the main factor that makes self-driving cars appear to be a good plan for the future of transportation. The car is manageable and not overriding the human input, and yet it still mantains a feeling of helpfulness and convenience.

When it comes to transport automation, control over the process, and the ability to halt or override it, is a chief concern. A system that controls itself and denies all outside input cannot sustain itself for long. That is why, to quote the passage, ""Google cars are not truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" In short, the car is not perfect, and therefore has to fall back on the driver's help in some situations. This prevents crashes due to the car's incapability to surpass a unique situation on the road, as well as promoting driver awareness even when the car is operating itself. By doing this, the self-driving car model itself promotes safety and good road etiquette.

While the car may not be able to do everything a human driver can, it has proven to be much better at the tasks it can do than an average driver. The cars provide ""far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" This can be coupled with the fact that these vehicles are being constantly upgraded in order to allow for ""more and more [automated] driving tasks."" Perhaps in the future there will come a car that is capable of doing every driver task there is, leaving the driver to sit back and relax.

In conclusion, while the industry has yet to truly take off, self-driving cars are a definite viability for the future of human transport. They provide comfort in the fact that you are in control, and they also perform better than most human drivers would on average. Overall, they promote a higher level of altertness and safety than the average modern vehicle. These facts together provide a strong argument in favor of the autonomous, or self-driving, cars of tomorrow.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6ECD533A72F4,"Driverless cars are the transportation system of the future. Their benefits greatly outweigh those of the current system. Driverless cars are easily possible to develop, much safer than regular cars, and have benefits for both people and the environment.

Driverless cars are already in development, and many manufacturers have already designed and created the technology which makes them possible. Driverless cars require sensors which allow them to mimic human reaction to whatever situation might arise while on the road. Sensor technology has been in development and in use since the 1980s, with the introduction of antilock brakes. Using this technology, Google modified a Toyota Prius with several sensors which allows the car to access a 3-D model of its environment. The proper technology to introduce driverless cars is clearly already available to manufacturers. In fact, in 2013, BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" which allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itself. The world is already well on its way to the creation of a truly driverless car.

Some might object to the safety of driverless cars, but in reality, driverless cars introduce more safety to the road environment. An operating system or machine cannot become tired, frustrated, emotional, angry, or distracted in any way; its judgement is mechanical, and there are no variables of human unpredictability. Most if not all vehicular accidents are caused by some sort of human error in judgement, and driverless cars eliminate this possibility, which is conducive to a much safer driving environment. A possible cosumer concern might be that with the current model of semi-driverless cars, which still require some human effort, people may get tired or distracted waiting for their turn to drive. However, manufacturers are developing an answer to this concern which introduces more safety than a regular driving environment would have. Some manufacturers are introducing in-car displays which turn off instantly when driver assistance is required, which is not possible with a regular cellphone or messaging device. This eliminates any in-car distraction during the driving task, With human error eliminated, driverless cars are much safer than regular ones.

Finally, the driverless car introduces benefits to both people and the environment. Driverless cars can allow people to safely engage in other activities besides driving, allowing them to achieve and accomplish more. Driving can be tiring, and driverless cars eliminate driving as a task for people to complete. Many factors can impair driving ability and prevent one from driving, but with driverless cars, mobility is always possible, and transportation is always accessible. A Google cofounder estimates that driverless cars can eventually eliminate the need for personal cars at all, by introducing a public transportation system of entirely driverless vehicles, and that these vehicles can use half the fuel of current taxis. This can have huge benefits for the environment.

Driverless cars are a much better alternative to the transportation systems of today. They can and are being devleoped, carry benefits to the environment and to people, and are much safer than regular cars.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Every year they are getting closer and closer to inventing driveless cares, in 2009 they started or were trying to invent a driveless car. They have been thinking and fascinated these cars in television and in movies. I agree o driveless cars being used because sesing the roads, driving and assisating, and it will be safer and thats what the law or the goverments wan't.

The car has sensors and will break by itself or know when there is danger or stuff behind you when you are in reverse.

Ever sice 1980 they started to use speed sensors but that was for the speed now they are putting break sensor when you push on the break hard the breaks automaticly turn on and they stop the car really quick to avoid crashes. These sensors will help out the human driver better controle and for he could manage the car and not to spin out. More and more improvements in sensors and cuputer hardware and software are being invented for driving could be more safer.

Driving and assisting people would help with being more safe on the road. In 2003 they announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", meaning if you are driving near a traffic jam or an accident has accured you cant pass 23mph. The car can steer,accelerate, and brake themselfs, but they have touch sensors the car wont move if it doesnt feel the hands on the stearing wheel and the drivers full attention. For tye drivers wont get board they brought in-car entertaiment systems that use heads up displays, displays will turn off when the driver needs to take ove, something no availablee to drivers trying to text will the cell phone. This assistance will help people that cant see good but need to drive and handlycapp people also.

The law wants safe cars and the drivers to be safe and they are giving them cares that will be safe and drive by themself. A lot of states like California, Florida, and Nevada do not think these cars are safe so they are illegal in these states. Alot of states these cars have been proven to be more better and safer than cars that are there so it is legal to have these cars there. They dont even let them test drive how safe they are. Still if the law is changed they will have to make new laws because in the case of an accident, if technolagy fails.

This is why I agree on on the development of these cars. They are gonna be the future they will help alot of people not crash and to be more safe on the road. They are planning to have self driving cares by 2020 so we wont have to do anything anymore just hop on the cars on point A and get off at point B.

For example: Your in the car and your in the middle of nowhere and your by yourself and the car stops driving and you dont know hpw to drive. most likey you'll have to leave the car there. Another example: Say your driving in heavy traffic and the car stops driving itself and you cant drive, it could cause a accident.

An accident can happen, or someone or people could get hit and killed,or the car can run off the road, or hit into a buliding or object.

I am against Driverless Cars. This is because you can't trust the computers in the cars to not make mistakes. If the car makes a mistake and the passengers get hurt, there is no one to blame. What if the car causes a wreck and kills someone? How will their family have closure? They won't. It's not like you can put a car in jail like you can a reckless driver. These are some things to think about.

People would use this car as an excuse to go out dinking more. This would cause an increase in alcholism, leading to more deaths from liver failure. It would make it easier for people to conduct drive by shooting and get away with it.

Crimes would extremly high and there would be no one to take the blame.

Another question is, who would be responsible? Would it be the maker of the car or the ""driver?"" How many people would get tickets, because the police can't be sure that it wasn't the car that was swirving in between the lines? What if there is a bad signal and the cars stop in the middle of the highway? You can't trust a car that drives itsel, it's just not safe.

D8F3209E84CF,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of cars that drive themselves. Although, there are bountieous reasons why driverless cars are a good thing, there are also myriads of reasons as of why this could also be a bad thing. From upgrading roads to the invasion of privacy, driverless cars are not looking too good for the future.

The article mentioned ""many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads."" What that piece is stating is in order to have smart cars or driverless cars the U.S will require ""massive upgrades,"" hence the mention of smart roads.

The roads will need to have built in radio signals to send messages, in binary code, to the car, to alert the car of road conditions or any problems. In response to knowing this the author states that this was ""simply too expensive to be pratical."" So now that smart roads are out of the question, it is up to technology to teach the car human skills.

Technology is being used to help the cars ""mimic the skill of a human at the wheel,"" as the article states. It has the proper sensors, but sensors alone could not possibly be enough. According to the article the cars are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. Everything about driving a car on the road is a human skill, not to mention technology is known to have loop holes and gaps hidden throughout it. Statistics most likely shows that there are many ways to hack into the technology and change how a company programs their product to work. If it is not being hacked into, technology and the internet is also known to malfunction often, which could lead to innumerable amounts of incidents.

Another concern with driverless cars is invasion of privacy. The article mentions that while the driver watches the road, the car will be watching the driver. An issue with that would be that if the footage gets out and private information is shown in the footage will the company be held responsible. This could cause issues as identity theft and more to rise. Wanting to be sure that drivers are focusing on the road is one thing, but if it causes a stir with privacy that could potentionally be bad for the car companies and the people in charge.

My position of driverless cars is no technology could drive a car better than humans. Driving is a human activity, it started with humans and should end the same way. I do agree the world would use less gas, but I don't believe it is quite as safe as it seems. There are countries and people who are already in debt, we should be trying to help them out before we try to spend billions on smart roads. We also can not just rely on technology to keep us safe, there are already an aboundant amount of technology malfunctions going on, adding this to the equation would not help. Lastly, one that will probably have more of a concern with everyone would be privacy, I do not believe most people would feel safe knowing they are being watched as they are driving, and knowing that fact could even possibly make them unfocused.

These cars seem to have many good things about them but actually have plenty of negative effects. The diverless cars ahould not be developed.

Driverless cars are not practical because the cars are not 100% driverless. The driverless cars can only be alone in 25 mph conditions. The car also can not be alone in traffic or near construction. As stated in paragraph 7 ""the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" The human in the car can not even relax while the car drives itself because he/she must still watch the road and be ready to drive when the car can not. Then the driver will be nervous waiting for their turn to drive when it is time. The driver will just feel much more stressed. Is it not better for the driver to just drive at all times and avoid stress about getting on the wheel on time?

Some might say that the driverless cars are great because you are much safer in them. These cars have a lot of new and smart technology that helps in making a car trip much safer for the driver and its passengers. Also it alows the driver to multitask while the car drives. Drivers can be on their phones or finish up their hair and/or makeup. When the driver is in a tough situation they can just let their cars get through it and take back the wheel whenever he/she is ready..

The driverless cars are not as safe as they seem with all its technology. The number one reason people get into car crashes is because they were distracted ,usally by their phones and encouriging drivers to be on their phones in a ""driverless "" car is very dangerous. With these new cars it will be very hard to try and even multitask. Since they are not self-efficient the driver must pay attention to the road at all times ,therefore making it very hard to safetly turn around and do something else. Drivers when trying to do something ,in a hurry will have to leave what they are doing to attend to the wheel when the car can no longer drive. Since the car will only be able to drive in specific conditions the driver must attend to the wheel constantly.

When I ask my self the same question I say yes I can Imagine it but am not sure of it's fact. I wonder about how the car can navitgate at night, who is responsible if a collision occurs, and how much privacy is lost when driving one of these self driving cars.

The car that can drive its self sounds right out of a cartoon or some kind of science fiction book and it makes me conserned about how relivent it would acualy be on the streets in the real world. How can I feel safe in a car traveling at high speeds on a dark night with winding roads, and the chance of a wondering animal or person to cross the path of the self driving car?

Their will need to be a fully functioning self driving car no assistance needed, so good the the probibility of a crash is small as getting struck by lightning. Until this thing is thuroughly fool proof they should'nt be able one public road, street, ave, or any other driving path. They say the confusion could posibialy be stopped by putting a camera in the car showing who was in control of the vehical at the moment of the crash but hoe much of the story would that tell?

Cars relating to the Google car will be a danger to many people,no one may see the problem if something of that car does not function correctly. Adding Entertainment inside of the vehical can cause many problems aswell. This will cause wreckage on roads and or unsafe usage of the vehical.

Driverless cars may have many uses ffor things such as going to work or going to places far and wide. But there can be consiquences if the driver or the programer does not use the the system of driverless car properly.

EAC6979C46E1,"Have you ever thought about the future? As a day gose by we have to start think about what will today be in 10 years from now. i can picture my self getting into a car that has automatic opeing doors and the car driving it self. We are living in a society where new thing are being made every day, just like the new cool hoverbored.

There are many pros to the new invention people are coming out with. Several of the ones i have herd are about how they will make life a lot easier. For example look at the new hover bored, a flat surface that can move right left back forward yes this make life easier but it also effects us. You could be walking places that will give you good extercise.

When you take a look at car driving themselfs that is kinda scary though. just imagen what could happen if the car took a wrong turn and there was a big trailer coming that could be your last day alive. We see on televison and movies that have long been fascinted with cas that could drive themselves but that is all but in reality that is all fanticy made by a computer. this world has taken it a step to far on how we are just being here for nothing why dont we just have computer do everything. Because that is what it looks like.

In conclusion I feel that this is a very hard topic to arrgue about beuase yes I would like to make life easier but at the same time I want it to be safe. I feel like we should be take life nice and slow and more car driving on there own for a bit firther in the future.   ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

There are many different ways that we could drive cars without using gasoline. The sun isn't there for no reason. I'm going to tell why i think i see cars in the future, but made different.

Earth does not have a life time supply of gasoline. We can desgin cars in different ways to make them drive. I think cars should be desgin to take over sometimes, but only at times when you need them. There are probably car crashes every day because someone has fallin asleep on the road, or texting, or drunk. Texting and drinking & driving have became a big thing these days for people these days.

Instead of using gas we could use energy for the sun to drive to car. such as solar power. but just imagine how much those cars would cost. Would they cost way more thsn the cars as of today? Would it have to have less people in the car because what if it takes a sertin amount of people bepending on how much people are in the car. Like i said before the sun isn't there for no reason. Many things as of today live off the energy of the sun's energy.

I believe there are so many ways we could drive cars in the future. I've seen videos where the car was suppose to stop on its on sincer in it. The main two things that i think we could use to keep cars running is solar power in water. The Earth is covered with 75% of water and pretty soon the ice up North is going to start melting and land is going to start over flowing with water in the future.

ABF9759CD8BF,"I support driverless cars. Driverless cars could make this world a safer place. Driverless cars drive for you if you want it to. If theres a construction area, traffic hold up, or its icey out you can take control of the car. If you ever feel unsafe in the car when you aren't driving you can take control. Its not like these cars are always driving for you. These cars are very impressive.

These cars would start out very expensive because they are so high tech. It would be hard for some people to afford them. If older people buy these cars it would be better for them. It could drive for them at night if they can't see as well. Or younger people that maybe aren't the best at driving. If your parents don't trust you with your liscense these cars would help. It would make your mom worry a lot less. These cars provide safe driving.

Driverless cars steer for you, the seat vibrates when you might be going into a hazardess area where you need to take control, and it has a GPS reciever. If you have an emergency and need to text someone this car provides safety. It will drive for you when you are texting. Hopefully people won't use this car the wrong way and text all the time because you still need to be aware of what's going on around you.

You don't need to worry about wrecking your car if this car is driving for you. If you are driving there is still a chance you could wreck it. Driverless cars have motion sensors and other things that make it safe in that range.

So all in all these cars provide safety. They have so many qualities that make them usable and great cars. This could be one of the best inventions in this world. It could create less crashes, less drunk driving accidents, less texting and driving accidents,and on and on. I hope they make this car to create a better world. It would help people in so many ways. Movies fanticize about driverless cars so why not actually have and use them. Driverless cars are coming no matter what people have to say about them.

38E6B2B33628,"I believe that driverless cars are and are going to be a great piece of technology development.

Driverless cars could give us a life changing future.

Driverless cars may sound questionable to some people but, I believe they could be safer than our vehicles today.

Google, BMW, GM, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have been working on creating safe, driverless vehicles for the last 10-15 years.

How far they have come in just this short amount of time amazed many people.

How far they are still planning to come will blow some people away.

Sensors alone have come a long way in just the past 10 years.

They are built to detect danger and respond to danger in possible accidents.

What the sensors can detect is far better than the response and control of a human driver

(ParaG 5).

The car is not totally driverless. I find this to be a plus for driverless cars.

Because technology is not always reliable, humans do need to assist with some of the things that technology can't be reliable for.

Just in 2013 BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Assistant.""

Then it could drive up to 25 mph.

Only going 25 mph, the car requires the driver to hold onto the wheel.

All the vehicles are designed to warn or notify the driver when it needs humans skills.

Companies are coming up with many ways to inform the human that assistance is needed.

Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009.

Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash (ParaG. 2).

Human drivers today have crashes daily.

No matter what, everytime someone gets in a car they are putting their life in danger. I believe that with the new technolgy advances in driverless cars, the number of car crashes would decrease tremendously.

Overall I believe that the advances for driverless vehicles have come so far in their development in just a short number of years. I think that driverless vehicles will be a safer and more efficient way of driving for our future.

They will be saving lifes daily, and saving money in the long run.                                          ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
75E9D43EB9E4,"My position on driverless cars is, that they wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. i believe this because they wouldnt know when to stop, they might go out of control, and they wouldnt be very surportive during deflict stiutions.

First i believe they wouldnt know when to stop because they might be road block and they wouldnt be able to identify the objects. Examples from the passage are, the cars will probably have a hard time navigating through work zones and around accidents. The cars will also have to deal with complicated traffic issues , such as navigating through roadworks or roadblocks that lie ahead for the autonomous car.

Second reason is, they might go out of control. The car might face some technical deflicties and someone will most likely get injured. If some dies get injured who will be at fault? wil it be the driver or the manufacturer. I believe it will be the manufacturer because they made the car and they didnt make sure if it was safe for the people to drive arounfd in or not.

My last reason is They wouldnt be as surportive during deflict stiutions. i think They wouldnt be very surportive because the car might not know what to do. For example, if there was roadblock and the car didnt or couldnt indenify them and the car crushes. What if the car was told to go somewhere and went to wrong way? will it be the cars fault. And if the car got broken down for no reason during traffic will it be okay for other people.

In conclusion i believ that driverless cars wont be as safe as cars driven by humans. i believe this because they wouldnt know when to stop, they might go out of control, and they wouldnt be very surportive during deflict stiutions.             ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E925DF5FD390,"Driverless cars seems like a great idea doesnt it? But think about it, people in the future are not really going to know how to drive a car. Cutting the past out isnt going to help in the furure.

First of all, Getting a driverless car you still have to drive. No one wants to drive a driverless car, and thats where a lot of crashes are goin to start. A lot of people are not going to be paying attention. Especially on the highway because the car can steer, accelerste, and brake themselves but cannot drive themselve through road work. Thats where the accdient is going to happen at, if the driver is not paying attention.

Additionally, most states have made it illegal to test computer driven cars. They say the law will be tooken down once the cars are approved. But what if in some states they dont take the law down, if the driver has to go through that state to get to another, there's going to be a problem. The driver then has to drive. But the driver doesnt really know how to and they only know parts of driving because the car did the rest of that.

Also, a driverless car is a very nice kind of car. they steer it self, accelerate , and brake themselve. It can function its speed up to 25 mph. Has a special touch sensor to make sure the driver has control of the wheel. Plus has an alert system to when there is a problem ahead the car can't keep control anymore.

I'm against driverless cars because hackers and the possible future that will come from this starting point. Other than that, I don't care for what it does or who gets it.

One of my reasons for rejecting driverless cars is hackers. I know not many people have hacker issues but the possibilty is still there. Hackers are becoming smarter each day as technology advances. What if hackers can get into the cars systems? I don't know about you but I find this very uncomfortable. Then there is the possibilty of technology rising up against us like the movie I-robot.

My second reason for rejecting driverless cars is the future this could lead us to. The movie Wall - E for explain. To me, I see our technology taking over what use to be our active lives. To be honest, this is the most laziest generation I've ever seen. We will start to become lazier and fatter because of it. That's what I see happening because driverless cars will start the chain reaction for that.

In conclusion, driverless cars are bad for an average human. Only reason I agree to have driverless cars are for those who are blind or have some form a disability.

A83ECE87ED2E,"My name is PROPER_NAME and i'am arguing about why I think driverless cars should not be built. My personal opinion is that people are the only thing that should be in control of a car so that there is not question on what happened if there was to be an accident. Is the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it even states that these cars warn the person in the car whenever they might have to take over because te cars can't move around an accident or for any other reason. The reason the cars do this is because they don't have the technology to navigate themselves through a car accident, around a construction site, or if there is major traffic ahead. I believe that these cars are unsafe and will cause harm to people because of the lack of fully advanced technology.

There are a few positives about the car such as being much more efficient on gas. The vision of these cars is public transportation. The insite on the cars is that they will be much more efficient than the everyday taxis that are used for transport and will be much more flexible that bus transportation.

Why would you want some man made thing ""helping"" you or driving your car for you? some people buy cars just so they can be able to drive thereselfs places if not they would take a bus , buses have other people drive other people places. plus, this new idea is a very bad one.. it sounds to me like a death trap like how could you have a mechine drive it self. it doesnt have eyes that can see whats going on in the road? i do not believe in a couputer to aporate my car for me. how would you feel safe if your not the one in control the whole time. i wouldnt want to ride or drive in a car that im not the one in control its different want its an actual person verse a computer.

What if you get into an accident with another car who's fault is it? yours or the cars or the computer aporating the car and if it hits another vehicle that is driving itself whos fault is it? it could be many different situations. another reason why i do not agree with this ""driverless cars"" is that they are paying money for this driver less cars when it still needs a driver but only sometimes.. you have to wait til its your turn or something? Dr. Werner Huber says ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" the way cars are made now are fine, why would people want to change it up? Making cars more advanced might seem like a good idea but its not. they said "" something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone"" or even when people want to talk on the phone we already have a safe way of doing it. some cars already have where you can contected your phone to your car with bluetooth. That way people can talk and drive while still staying safe and looking at the road the whole time.

lastley i want to talk about is after they make this driverless vehicles are they going to do away with other vehicles? how many people are going to actual want a computer driving there car for them. I think people are wasting there time and money on something that seems to be just a danger to any and all people and not even just people everything around. paragraph 10 states "" automakers are continuing their work on the assumtion that the problems ahead will be solved."" i hope all this time and money they are spending is worth it all. they are going to be not only be getting money from people who do decide to actually invest in this idea but they are just going to lose buisness.

Having driveless cars is a very cool and interesting thing, but it can also be very dangerous. I am all for having driveless cars but there are some dangers and questions that come with that. Such as ""How do we know that the technology is up to par?""and ""Will it know when to exactly tell me when i need to take over?"".

There is without a doubt some faults in sensatizing in the automotavies being created. There will never not be faults in some sort of new brand from phones to airplanes there will always be a fault somewhere so to completely throw this idea out is absurd and uncalled for.

In 2009, Google had already created a car that was almost completely independent and, many other companies such as General Motors had created similar cars. These cars have many unknown variables that still need to be worked out but, driverless cars will be a positive change towards the future.

Scientist have been working on creating a driverless car for years. As of 2009, Google created an almost independent car. The car could do almost anything. the downfall was that the car still relied on driver control in situations such as traffic construction zones. These cars have alert systems to alert the driver when human assistance is needed. Therefor these cars are still safe to operate but not completely independant.

The majority of the driverless cars being invented today have a great deal of sensors.

These sensors allow the cars to distinguish thier surroundings, giving the most amount of safety possible. These cars are also more fuel efficient and eco friendly. They will use less fuel and will be equipped with many safety features. These new features allow the car to see 360 degrees around the vehicle and keep the passenger as safe and comfortable as posible.

As of now, many of these cars still need human attention when driving. They are equipped with vibrating seats and sensors on the wheel to monitor that the human is alert. Eventually these cars will be able to navigate through all situations without any human support. This will allow passengers to enjoy the ride and drive longer distances faster. As well as maintaining confidence in thier safety.

These cars will allow passengers to utilize thier time more efficiently by allowing them to use the time they usually spend driving doing something else. People will be in less danger because there will be no room for human error. If all cars were self driven, then the capacity for safety would be maximized and there would be less polution because the cars are more economical, and less wasteful due to the fuel efficiency of the cars.

The driver has to be prepared at all times to be ready to take over the wheel. Drivers can not fully rely on driverless cars because drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, drivers are trusting a computer with their life, and the dangers of bordem behind the wheel.

Drivers have to pay attention to the road at all times, even if the ""driverless"" car is driving. The driverless car can not drive through work zones or around accidents, so the driver has to take control. The driver has to stay alert and ready for anything to come their way. The Google car announces when the driver should be ready to take control, but shouldn't a driverless car be able to drive on it's own? Eventhough the car can drive itself, the driver is still in position like they're going to drive too.

Drivers are trusting a computer based opperator with their life. What if the car was to get in an accident? Whose fault would it be? Drivers can't fully trust a computer to drive their car because they computer could mess up, and could cause an accident. What if a kid were riding a bike, and were to suddenly fall into the street and the driverless car did not read it? That would cause a big uproar for driverless cars. They are not proven to be 100% safe for the world around us.

The dangers of bordem of not driving could be very serious as well. The driver has to pay attention to the road at all times, but they are not driving. This could cause serious bordem, and could lead to falling asleep behind the wheel. At least when driving is occoured the driver has something to do.

Now a driverless car is not a bad idea. The text says that driverless cars use half the fuel that cars use today, and that driverless cars have driven half a million miles without a crash.

They can be used by someone from every age group that is able to drive. Young adults, middle aged people, and the elderly can all use the driverless car to help improve the roads in today's society.

For example, many parents might feel better knowing that their child is on the roads using a driverless car that is less likely to cause an accident. Teen drivers today are distracted when they first begin to drive. With a driverless car, however, teens could possibly get distracted but would not cause an accident. The car could continue driving for them. If the cars could accelerate for the driver, they could also prevent the driver from speeding. This would prevent many young adults who are less experienced on the roads from being pulled over by a police officer and given a ticket. Many parents may also become distracted while driving with young children. Young children need attention from their parents, and while in a car children tend to distract their parents more often usual. When a parent looks away from the road and to the backseat where their child is sitting, even if they are only looking away for a few seconds, they could run into the oncoming lane of traffic or possibly a ditch. With driverless cars, these accidents could be prevented. As long as the parent or teenager has his or her hands on the steering wheel, the car will drive itself. With BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", the driver would be able to look away from the road and the car would still be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Incase of a work zone or accident, the driver would be notified and they would assert their attention back to the road. This ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" would be useful while a mother needed to tend to her child in the back seat or while a teenager talked on the phone to their friend. The driverless cars would not be justt for teenagers and middle aged people, they could be used by elders as well. Often you will hear on the news or radio about how an elderly person fell asleep at the wheel and rear-ended the car in front of them, sometimes causing a bad accident. With the driverless cars, elders could possibly fall asleep, or they could be just as distracted as a young adult on the road, and still not cause an accident. As you age, your senses start to dull and that impares your driving. This could possibly cause an accident. With the driverless car, elders can still drive and not have their dulled senses impare their driving. Driverless cars could save many lives each year and prevent numerous accidents.

First, I know that even with the law of don't text and drive, people still do those things. Secondly , if we allow driverless cars I know that people who are tired from work are going to fall asleep knowign the car is in control, but at the end when theres trouble, they will still be asleep. Lastly, I believe that people will start sueing companies and people will not feel confortable of being stalked while driving.

First of all, there are many reckless drivers around us anyhow. How can we be sure that we are safe when driving?

In the passage "" something not avaible to the drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" I can not imagine but we do know for a fact that texting and driving is very dangerious but there are also people who are out there doing it. These situations can lead to mass accidents. If you are given the chance that your car does not need you and you do get bored off of the heads up display, what would you really do? Since our society is all about iphones and samsung , I do not think that its safe to be in a car with your cell phones on. I sense that teenagers are especially going to disobey the law because they just tend to think its going to be okay, which in reality its not. We should be very concerned of everyone driving safetly.

Seondly, I believe that exuausted and drunk people are going to take this advantage of having driverless cars. What if you car needs your help, and youre asleep and that you're too drunk to get self concious? This will lead to more troubles because than people that are drunk will still drive and think that their car has it all in control.""They can steer ,accelerate, and brake themself, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" The driverless can be very dangerious if in case in need of a human skill if someone is really tired and drunk.

Lastly, I believe that your rights are being taken away when you're beign stalked on while driving. I wouldnt want to be stalked on when i'm driving or anything. it violates someones privacy when youre watching them because some people od have to do certain things when they are parked for example like having to use an emergency or changing clothes. ""While the driver watches the road , the car watches the driver"" Do you really think that drivers are going to watch the road when they dont have to? I also believe that peopel will start sueing companies because who is at fault if theres an injury or accident?""if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is al fault- the driver or the manufacturer? I think that people who are being responsible and driving with great cautions will be upset and it would not be fair to them if they are under control of their own car and than there is someone els thats not drving but lettign their car being controled by a computer than they get in an accidents. I do knwo that there are accidents from many reasons, but I believe that driverless cars can cause a lot of problems.

In conclusions, I do not agree the fact that driverless cars should be allowed. It has many safety issues for the community and it will cause a lot of problems. It will violate someones privacy,someone can take advantage of driverless cars when they are drunk or tired, and lastly peopel will be upset. I think it depends on the indivuals who are driving. People should start caring more for others when driving because someones life can be at risk if they driver recklessly.

Driverless cars will lead into many big problems as well as to many life lost if youre not prepared when your car needs you.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming, makes great statements for and against the full time use and developments of the driverless cars. They say if these cars are developed, we will be saving half the fuel that today's cars use. These cars will be like a public-transport system that would offer far more felxability than a us. The cars they are developing at Google have been driven for more than half a million miles and none have had a crash yet, as stated in paragraph 2. Although the develpment of these cars will lead to many future costs, they may also lead, in the long run, to saving more money and making a cleaner Earth. The stance that I take with these cars, is that they could potentially be very succsessful in making our Earth greener and safer. I agree towards the development of driverless cars; If they are developed, they will be safer, cleaner, and impove everyday life.

The first argument for why these cars should countinue to be developed is because they will create a more safter way of travel. These cars are full of sensors, as told in paragraph 5. They have been around since the 1980's and they have become far more advanced; also responding to respose and control than a human could offer which makes theses cars a lot less likley to crash, making them safer. If these cars have the tecnology to stay on a one track line because of the way they are sensored, that could lead to far less collisions and accidents, making a much safter way to travel.

Secondly, the reason why I agree with smart cars is the fact that they have the biggest oppurtuinity to be a new, cleaner way of travel. As stated in the first paragraph, these cars have the chance of using half of the amount of fuel that we use today with public-transport. If we create a sysytem of these cars to replace taxis and buses, then we can reduce an impacting amount of pollution from the world, making it far more cleaner.

Lastly, the reason why I am for the development of these cars is becuse they will help improce everyday life. These cars will create a much easier and personal way to get around, than the public transportation that we have today. In paragraph 1, Sergey Brin envisions the cleaner and easier way we can travel in the future. He believes, like me, these cars would fundamentally change the world. From fuel to flexability, they can create a much more simple way to travel in the approaching years.

The reasons why I believe these cars should have countinued development is: they will be safer, cleaner, and life changing. This article makes great statements for why and how these cars can be positivley and negativly impacting. We have been facinated as human with cars that could drive themselves in TV and movies, in reality we do have this but imagine how much we could help the earth and the people on it by cutting back fuel and the pollution of all the trvael we use today. There will probobly be a lot more trials and errors that come from attmepting to incorperate these cars into everyday life but in the end they will prove to be reliable, clean, and safer.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BB84B185AE32,"Do you like not being in control? Have you ever felt powerless? These are the feelings you would have if you own a driverless car. Sure, the car will make things easier at times, but what if it acts up. What could you do?

Driverless cars could be a great danger to society! I know that driverless cars can catch the eyes of our society, since we've become technology filled. We can't let that get to us though. Like everything else that requires a computer, there is always a flaw. We can't put our lives in the hands of these cars. In the article it mentions that these cars will not always know how to deal with traffic, accidents, driveways and construction. We could get in a accident or even get murdered from these cars.

Although there are many flaws with this model, there are also some postitves too. Instead of driving and struggling with your phone, you can easily put the car in control. You can call, talk to passangers, do work and even eat while it drives. I know it's hard for most drivers to put there complete attention on the road but it's not for a computer. There would be less accidents, no drunk driving and no sleeping at the wheel. It may be a good contribution to our society.

Even though driverless cars bring great contributions, what happens when it acts up? Sure you can take control of the car but what if you're not paying attention? You could create a serious accident. The article says that these cars can not respond to accidents. If you create a sudden accident would'nt that create the other driverless cars to spin out of control? I think we need to stick with our original cars. These driverless cars are ticking time bombs waiting to go off. Lets keep this place safe!          ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4526CDC06F9A,"People have loved the fact that there could be cars that can fly or hover over water, but one thing is for sure is that people would like so see a self driving car. Many companies around the world like Mercedes Benz,BMW,Audi, and Nissan have planned to create a marvelous autopilot self driving car by the year 2020,but there are some pros and cons that could affect the future of these invention.

Lets start with the positive side of this arguement. some good ideas that would be perfect for this invention that could change everything forever is that driverless cars will not just help people on regular basis, it could also help other terms like heavy work or abulances or police force. In the last sentence of the text it says "" The road to hte truly autonomous car streaches on ahead of us, but we grow clsoer to the destination everytday. In my opinion driverless cars should also be used as tools that we could need to build something better.

Another pro that could help people would be cars programmed to help the disable people who have lost an eye, or its legs. It would help millions of people around the world and counting. maybe it could drive by itself completly but it could assist the people while person waits on its destination. In paragraph 7 of the article is says that BMW has relased a cars that can asssist people with the brakes,steer,and acceleration but beyond that the person can also take over the car at anytime.

Well we have talked about what are the good things about having a driverless car and its factors, but now let's talk about the negative things the cons. One thing that is in people's mind is that when driving this type of car or buying one in a dealer is their safety and their safety for their children or famliy members on board of a car that drives by itself. If the car that the person bought is not well ajusted or even well tested that is safe to use then why buy something that dosent even have a 100% full perfect function. That is why in the text it says that most states in the united states have no allowed for auto pilot cars in their streeets is because they are not well ajusted or not very updated as it should be.

Another con that is kinda bothering me is that people are trying to get more and more reliable and used to the fact that they are more dependable to technology now in days. In my opinion peole are sometimes lazy and huge companies are showing and introducing cars like this to people they are affecting they are affection skills of people and its way of being depedent.

Therefore those are the good and bad things about having a future car that can actually might or might not help the future more foward or turn back in time.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E7DA6AAEFDAA,"Driverless cars are cars that can opperate and drive on roads wihtought a human accelerating, decelerating, and steering the car. Personally I am both for, and against driverless cars. Just like everything in this world, there are positives and negatives to them. Driverless cars can make it easier on people in their everyday life, but they could also be dangerous to pedestrians or others around the driverless cars. I will now tell you my opinion on driverless cars giving facts to support why I think so.

Starting with the postives, driverless cars can make life easier for everyday drivers. It could potentially reduce the percentage of texting and driving becuase the human is not really the one driving, and operating the vehical needing to give their full attention to the road. When the car is driving it's self, it is more aware of what's around it because it can see and sense the whole car without any blind spots, but this is not including work zones or other special road conditions of course. Also, it may be able to reduce speeding tickets and reckless driving.

Although there are many benefits to driverless cars, are they really safe? There actually isn't one car in the world today that is completely driverless. All of them need some type of human assistance, if it means backing out of the drive way, getting through a road constuction, or making it through a tricky road. We all know technology is advancing everyday by the second, but with that being said technology fails all the time. There could be a glitch with the system, or it could just completely crash and we would be relying on the car to continue to drive its self. Doesn't sound very safe in my opinion.

With smarter cars comes smarter roads? Some companies such as General Motors has led themselves to belive if you update roads, putting some type of magnet, or metal device in them to sensor to the cars, they will have no problem driving on roads. Although, that sounds brilliant would it really work? General motors made a smart track, embedding electrical cables to radio signal negative and positive energy to the front end of the car. It was very succesful, but not every road is as smooth runnng as the track was.

Say a company figured out how to create a driverless car, and humans weren't really needed to opperate it, only if something was going wrong, would the laws change? I belive every person who is going to be driving one would need a special license, and they would need to go to a class to learn proper techniques of what to do, and how to react if the car started loosing control and something was going wrong. There is also big contraversy on who would be at fault if the car did have technical issuses and ended up injuring or killing somebody, the cra manufacturer or the individual behind the wheel. Althoug, theres are positives that are really cool, and exciting about driverless cars, they are dangerous and would change so much about the law, and driving on roads. I personally don't see driverless cars becoming a thing on the roads any time soon.    ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E0C83B2CB6BE,"Do you think we need driverless cars? The cars Google founder Sergey Brin makes would use half of fuel of today's taxis. All of the driverless cars today need a actual driver. There are both positive and negative things about driverless cars but, I think that they are not neseccary.

I perosnally think that driverless cars are not worth getting because you still need a driver incase of bad road conditions. Whats the point of buying that very expensive car if your gonna have to eventually drive the driverless car. Say your in a rush for work and your on the phone with your boss butting on eyeliner and then it happends... you run into roadwork and your hands are all occupied and then you don't know what to do. That is another reason because you can crash and it wouldn't be safe for you or for any other people on the road.

In conclustion I believe that driverless cars are not neseccary nor safe enough to drive. I can see were people would think its good idea because they are efficent and can be a big boost in technology but Its not worth the bad saftey issue it has.                 ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F44A8B59CF6A,"Driverless cars are starting to be created, and eventually they will be allowed on the streets everywhere. With that being said, that means that there will be more dangers that pedestrians and drivers have to worry about. If one thing went wrong with a driverless car it could potentially cause an accident and leave people injured and/or dead. Without having a driver that is specifically paying attention to the road, you never know what might happen. At any point in time the car could malfunction and nobody would be there to maintain control. Cars are meant to have a driver, and without a driver nobody knows what may happen.

These days, cars that have to have a driver still malfunction and sometimes the driver is not even enough to help keep them from causing an accident. Without a driver this risk would be even larger leaving everyone more concerned about getting into an accident. There should always be someone who is watching the road at all times and if things do start going badly then they are able to fix what is going on.

The longer that driverless cars are around the more that they will be available leaving less manual cars out there. This means that cars will become more expensive due to all of the technology that has to go in the cars to make then drive by themselves. More and more people will have to go without a vehicle because they will not be able to find any that can fit into their budget. Driverless vehicles will ruin the chance of some people getting a newer vehicle due to the rising prices.

If driverless cars continue to only be allowed to go up to speeds of 25 miles per hour and cannot drive by themselves through workzones and around accidents then there is really no point in having them. Many places, even around small towns/cities, have a speed limit higher than 25 miles per hour. The car would be no use and the driver would have to drive the car themselves. Even if the car could drive through anything and go any speed, the person in the drivers seat would have to remain alert at all times because you never know when the car could malfunction and potentially cause an accident.

Even though there are many downfalls of driverless cars, there are also many upsides to them. One of these would be the vibration of the drivers seat in the GM when the vehicle could possibly back into an object. Another thing is the cameras that could watch the person in the drivers seat to make sure that they are watching the road. This would help people stay focused and remain focused while they were in the car. Driverless cars would be very nice, especially for people who have to drive really far or who do not like to drive, but they are not as safe as a real driver.

Technology is becoming so advanced that in just a few years driverless cars will be made and seen on the streets. This puts many people in danger and everyone will have to be more carfeul on the road. Some people that are going to own these cars will not put their full attention on the road, and when the car malfunctions or stop then there will be an accident. These cars will cost a lot more money that many people do not have, leaving them without a car. If driverless cars do become the future there needs to be many laws and requirements made about the car and the person who owns the car.         ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Just imagine if there were no cars, train stations would be crowded. There would probably be arguments all the time. It just wouldn't feel right. If this was to happen i would try evrything in my power to try and stop it.

What's going to be on the roads, the world would just look empty as if nobody was ever on earth. I dont think everybody in this world would get the mindset of not having a car. Some people might think it's possible, but thats not humily possible. It would have to be some type of debate for something like this to happen, but honest opinion is that it'll never happen.

CCDF4588086F,"I am against the development of driverless cars. Automotive companies have made some really good products and worked really hard, but i feel like it is pointless. There would be a few benefits of a driverless car, but as they said in the passage, no car is completely driverless. If you have to do the same thing in a driverless car that you would do in a regular vehicle, then I do not see the point. I feel like driverless cars are pointless, going to be expensive and promote lazyness.

If you have a driverless car, the passage states that you still have to pay full attention and be ready to grab the wheel at any time. If you have a regular vehicle, then you also have to pay full attention and hold onto the wheel as well. The only benefit you would get from this would be a break from steering for a few minutes until you are to take control. People have been driving for years, vehicles have been advanced to be safer and more efficient for years, so why do we need technology to do this driving for us?

Not only do I believe this is a rediculous idea, I believe driverless cars would be very expensive. In the very first sentence of the passage it reads ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" If nobody is buying cars, how are vehicle companies going to make money? Their income will quickly decline, if not dissapear all together. I can imagine the price of these driverless cars would be threw the roof. Making these driverless cars calls for an abundance of advanced technology and the cost would be much higher than any standard car.

How hard is it to get into a car seat and steer a wheel? Teenagers begin driving at ages 15 or 16, if driving was too difficult I do not think people would start so young. Transportation is a big part of everyday life. We have managed to drive ourselves place to place for may many years and we will be able to do it for many many more. 2016 is a very big year for vast changes in technology. Businesses have created so many spectacular devices to do everyday things for us, such as, GPS, robots, hoverboards and many more. The society today is a huge promotor of lazyness. We do not need technology to do everything for us when we are completely capable of doing it ourselves.

A driverless car may seem very beneficial to many people, but I honestly believe it is just another waste of time and money. There are far more cons than pros in this argument. It is very dangerous, pointless, expensive and it promotes people to be dependent and lazy. There have been some very useful inventions but this is not one of them.

B6D6666FEF89,"When someone hears the words ""driverless cars"", they get excited at the thought of something so futuristic at one time that it seems like something out of a science fiction novel. However, now that dream is becoming a reality. Large companies such as Google or BMW are advancing in this highly experimental field, and Google has been since as early as 2009. But is letting the machine take over most of the time really the best option? Could it lead to even more problems than it hopes to fix? These questions have yet to be answered and need to be.

In 2013, BMW began developing a project they dubbed the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", allowing a car to handle all possible functions up to the speed of 25 mph. But even though the car drove itself, the driver still had to remain alert and keep both hands on the wheel where sensors were located. And in such situations as work zones or accidents, the driver had to take over. Moments like these should always be handled by the driver, because the only thing a vehicle needs is one single driver. If a pedestrian ever makes the mistake of crossing too late on a crosswalk in the middle of the street, the car is not going to be ablle to know if it is coming or not or whether the car can steer clear of causing an accident because of human error.

There is also the consideration of laws. In our current era, whoever hits someone initially in a traffic collision, is the one to blame, and the one who helps pay off the other driver's bill. Human error is a natural thing, and we all make mistakes, but if there is ever an accident in which an autonomous car is made and is involved in an accident, who is responsible in the end? Is it the driver, or is it the car which is supposed to be incapable of making mistakes? Allowing a car to be responsible for one person's life is not the best decision, and should be thought out more accordingly, than just seeing it as a fun toy because our laziness is growing so much, that we can't even drive for ourselves.

Then there is the cost, both on our wealth and our experience. If we allow cars to drive us around and take us anywhere we like, what will happen when it's our turn to drive. We will be less alert, paying attention to our surroundings instead of focusing on the road. Some may argue that cars come with warning signals that the driver must take control soon, but will they have enough time to completely survey the area and assess the situation? Or will the car be able to warn them in time? The answer is most likely to be answered, but is still a dangerous situation for a new driver. In 20 years these cars may be a new one of society's norms, and everyone might own a car that drives on its own. But before we can reach that day, we have to decide if we're willing to pay large amounts of dollars for a car that takes away all feeling of something belonging to us and seeming to be in our control. The ""Cars of the Future"" will cost extraneous amounts of dollars, just for the ability for us to drive only some of the time, and not all of it.

Some people may argue that there are beneficial sides to an autonomous car, and of course there are. These cars would cut down our costs on gas, they could even be safer than some humans driving cars, and they could all be traced around on a track designed just for the cars. But it all comes back down to cost. The thought of replacing all roads with ""Smart Roads"" is not only seemingly impossible, but timewise it would take a lifetime. If every single road was taken apart and rebuilt all over America, the world even, it would take at least 10 years, and the cost would be enormous. And these cars are safe, but if that situation ever hits, no one is going to want their death or disability caused by a car driving on its own because of human error, yet again.

The concept is definitely real, and they have continued to being developed. The only thing to see now is if they can pay the price, develop more solutions than problems, and see if laws can be passed in their favor. It will take years, or maybe even a decade before we see who will be driving behind the wheel in the end, the human, or the car itself.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

AB0DA2E65FEB,"We all had dreams about having flying cars and driveless cars, but now we can almost say our dreams are becoming a reality. Automakers are working on manufacturing driveless cars. Driveless cars will eventually help us all in the future, when they are developed. If someone is drunk driving the car will for the most part drive itself with the help of sensors. If someone has fallen asleep in the car and something bad happens the car will alert the driver. First the automakers thought of making smarter roads, but with out the option of smarter roads, the manufacturers then thought about smarter cars. They did not know exactly how smart the cars would have to be but they knew for sure that they would need a lot of sensors to start out with.

To help support the claim that driveless cars will be helpful in the future is the fact that they will have many sensors. The new driveless cars will have a position sensor on the left rear wheel. This helps the car stay in between the lines while driving. The next senor will be a rotationg sensor on the roof so the car knows where other cars are around it and when to stop at red lights, stop signs, yield signs, etc. It will also have four automotive radar sensors and an intertial motion sensor, to detect the movement of other cars. The car will still have a speed and brake sensor also to know how fast it is going and when to stop. The driveless car will have a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, so the car knows how far and if there is a car behind them. Lastly the car will have a GPS recevier so the car knows where it is going. All of these sensors are installed to keep the driver safe and improve on how the vehicle can drive on its own.

The car is also very easy to take control of. For the things the sensors can not sense the car will alert the driver when they need to take control. The human in the car should always remain alert for when these problems may occur but if they can not the car will send the driver an alert. The new driveless cars will have seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. If the driver has fallen asleep then the vibration of the car should be firm enough to wake them up. Now while the driver is just waking up they do not really know what is going on, so the driveless car will also announce that there is a problem and the driver should take control. By the car announce when there is a problem is very helpful because if one of the sensors were to go out then that would be a problem and the car will announce it and the human will take over.

Even though the car will be very helpful there are some problems that could occur. The only way to know for sure that someone will be safe while driving is to have a human in control at all times. Driving laws are focused on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and the lawmakers know that safety is best achieved when the driver is fully alert. That is why the driveless car will have many sensors for when they sense a problem occuring on the road or occuring within the car. When the sensors do sense a problem occuring the car with alert the driver and let them know that they need to take control by vibrating the seat and announcing the problem. Though many people think driveless cars are not safe, automakers are continuing to work and test the cars until we can know for sure that they are completely safe for all drivers.

CD393BD5FB51,"Driverless cars have good and bad things that would go along with them. From my perspective though I believe that we could go without them. Cars that can drive themselves not only puts the one driving in danger but anyone around the car. Having driverless cars just makes us lazy,if we can not drive a car. Driverless cars should not be something we should invest our money into.

Cars that can drive themselves is a very dangerous and scary idea. A big machince that is operating itselve around others that are doing the exact thing is not a good idea. Very many mechanical mishaps could happen easily to cause the car to do things it wasnt made to do. If an animal or a person would happen to jump in the street would the car be able to detect that and stop the car before something very bad was to happen?

Having driverless cars puts a bad message on us. Having driverless cars would mean we dont want to drive or are too tried to drive or just to lazy. I think that this would make the United states look bad if we were to happen to get driverless cars.

Driverless cars may save us money individualy but over all as a coutry I think we could lose money. Driverless cars have so many sensors and devices that would need to be installed and would have to be manufactured which causes a lot of money. ""These smart road systems worked suprisingly well,but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.""

3389995864AB,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. After reviewing this article, I have formed an opinion of being for the development of these cars. They will create a more efficient traffic system, the cars are safe therefore creating safer roads, and even though the car is doing most of the work, humans still have full control over the vehicle.

Many car companies have discovered different ways to improve traffic efficiency. For example, ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This creation was designed to imrpove traffic drastically.

Driverless cars are proven to be safe by many research programs. With it's motion dection sensors and human-brain-like technology, self-driven cars could not be more cautionary. A lot of the technology is very advanced, for example from Google, ""it [the car's feature] uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.""

Creating a full view of anything the car should be aware of in it's surroudings.

The thought of eventually having no control over today's advanced techology scares many people, however, with the self-driving driverless cars that is not something to be worried about. Although the car does do a lot of the work, incase of an emergency or in any case where only the skills a human mind can surpass, the people in the car have full control over the vehicle. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents,"" says BMW.

To conclude, I believe that supporting self-driving driverless cars will improve our future for the better. Whether its because of increasing traffic efficiency or creating safer roads. Also, knowing that humans will still have access to all controls having to do with the car, why wouldn't the human race want to acquire driverless cars?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
770AD5E81C24,"Driverless cars are a new thing in the world.

Some people think that the cars are the best thing in the world because you don't have to actually drive, but some other people think that they are a bad idea because they don't trust them.

Being in the driver seat of a driverless car can be stressful.

If the driver didn't trust the car to drive itself then the driver would be freaking out everytime the car applied the gas, breaks or even just turned the wheel.

This invention is very high tech but there are many things that are needed before they are out on the roads.

Driverless cars can be dangerous in many ways.

Since they are new, there may be some flaws.

The car could accidently apply the gas instead of the breaks and then there would be a crash, or the wheel could turn right instead of left and you would be going the wrong way. That would make the driver frustrated and then they would end up taking over the car and driving themselves anyway.

Or what if there is a crash, then who would be responsible for it.

Would it be the driver of the driverless car or would it be the manufacturer who designed the car in the first place.

The car could have a malfunction and the driver of the car would be blamed even though they were not even driving the car.

Right now the driverless cars are illegal in most states to even test them.

So if they are not tested properly, why would a driver want to risk his/her life when they could just drive themselves and they can guarentee that they know they are going the right way and they would know that the car would stop at a stop sign instead of speeding up.

These cars need to be worked on a few more years before they get released to the public to where they can buy them off a lot.

On the other hand, if the cars are developed properly, it should notify the driver when he/she needs to take over the car.

There are some situations where the driver may need to take over such as in construction or heavy traffic.

You may need to take over when driving through construction to ensure safety.

The car will let you know when you need to take over by vibrating the seat or flashing lights on the windshield.

There is also a safety feature that manufacturers are considering that uses cameras to watch that drivers are always focused on the road even if they are not driving.

While the driver watches the road, the car will watch the driver to make sure they are still paying attention and that can help improve safety with these cars.

In conclusion, I think that driverless cars are dangerous right now, but with more years of development, they may be the new thing of the future.

Once every state in the country allows the cars to be tested, then that will be the next step towards having the cars on the roads and available to the public.

But that may take a few years.

The manufacturers have to make sure the cars have no flaws that could cause an accident and be their fault.

By 2020, some car companies such as Nissan and Audi plan to have cars that can drive themselves.

Everyday car manufacturers are getting one day closer to creating driverless cars to the public.

But I think that the cars need to be tested properly before they even think about putting them on the roads.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E2173A9CD1AC,"Driverless cars are definitly an advancement in society today. Although there are slightly independent cars today, it is projected that by 2020 Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan plan to have self driven automotives. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" a decent amount of benifits were listed. One of those benifits are safety features, such as the inability to use a telocommunication device while in the vehicle.

Each of the self driven automotives will have regulations. While the car is in the self driving mode the opperator must be alert. By doing this the driver must have both hands on the steering wheel. The steering wheels have a sensor built in; made to ensure that when road conditions ahead need human capabilities they can take over quickly and safely. Another restriction included in the driverless cars are the ability to shut off all systems instantly. For example in-car entertainment is a privlage but may be turned off when neccessary.

These self driven cars include many other features as well. GPS, Tire, motion, and radar sensors are installed in these vehicles. When in reverse newer cars have the ability to have a camera in there dash to see the surroundings behind them. Vibrating seats are a feature used to alert the driver when they are close to hitting an object around them. With these advancements in the self driving automotives the opporation system can be a copy cat of a human driver.

Not only do the driverless cars have safety features but save on gas. The self driven cars are projected to recieve better gas millage, using half the fuel our automotives use today. As stated in the article by Sergey Brin, "" Such cars would fundamentally change the world."" Not only will each tank of gas last longer, but there will be less fumes going into the atmosphere.

Advancing modern cars into self driving vehicles in a societal achievement. Having safety features such as sensors, vibrating seats, and the restriction of cellphone use will decrease accidents. These vehicles require the driver to stay alert, and detect when conditions require human assistance. The evolution of self driving cars is progressing, with a target of cars being on autopilot 90 percent of the time. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FF21CAA2F125,"You would get a lot of different answers from a lot of peopleif you were to go up to sme and ask them on what they think about the driverless car. But if you were to go and ask me that question i would have to say that I don't think we need to really be focusing on that as much as we should for other thngs in this world, it isnt as safe and could be very dangerous, there isnt anything wrong with having others drive themsleves.

First, I personally believe that there are more serious issues going on in this world that we should be focusing on more and putting more ofthe money twoards that then spending millions trying to get a car to drive by itself. A driverless car is not something we need to be worrying about when we can keep it easy and simple like it has been for many years and just have drivers driving the car.

Secondly, it has yet to been passed by the law due to safety percautions. As of right now the driverless cars are not as safe as a car that has some one driving the vechile. So with that reason whhy there I dont feel like what the need is to try and create something when we are all doing fine and would be doing even better then the driverless car.

Lastly, why fix something if it isnt broken? i get that driverless cars could be helpful for some people at times but to solve that problem that's what taxi's are for. Everythng has been fine with having the people drive the car themselves. People will be more alert then the driverless car itself so it is just best to just keep it as the way it has been going and let the people drive the car themsleves because there isn't anything wrong with doong it like that.

In conclusion, if you were to want to hear my opionin on what I have to say about the driverless cars I would say I think they are neat and could be somethng big in the future to come. As of now though I think that there are bigger things going on in this world right now that we should be focusing on, they are not proven to be as safe then what it is with having someone driving the vechile. And there is not a big problem on having people drive the cars themsleves so there isnt a big need for a solution like this.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9E8336991700,"Are dreiverless cars a good idea for the future? There are many pros and cons to these cars.

One down side to these cars are the price. Making the driverless cost more due to the amount of gadgets that they need to perfect it. Although, it cost less for gas because it does not use as much. Because there is not an owner of these cars, the gas prices do not benefit anybody. The only benefit is that gas is reserved for a longer period and slows the use of it tremendously.

There are many car accidents that are caused by human error and these type of cars may reduce the number of injuries or deaths for some period of time. However, technology is yet to prove that it can last forever without malfunctioning. This may cause accidents that could have been prevented.

Another down side is the time of travel. If these cars are used as taxis, then they may not take you wherever it is you need to go right away. It may make several stops before you are at your own destination.

There are other resolutions to the problems of modern day transpirtation. These are less expensive resolutions. If the reasoning for driverless cars is due to the amount of gass it uses, then that can be resolved by electric cars. If the issue is safety, then people need to be more careful. It is acceptable to add new features to a modern day car for safety purposes, but there is no need to re-make cars to be automatic.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not needed and are unessicary. The only aspect of transpirtaion that needs majorly improved is the intellegence of modern day drivers. There are more cons than there are pros for the driverless cars, therefore they should be prevented.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

BF195B6C980A,"Driverless cars would be an amazing new technology to introduce to the world. The ability to simply call a taxi and have a driverless car pick you up and take you wherever you wish, whenever you wish will revolutionize the way people get around. The technology may be in its primitive stages as of now, but soon driverless cars can help to automate many tasks that are currently being done by humans. Driverless cars will be an excellent addition to the modern world.

Not only does the driverless car make sense practically, it also has many safety benefits. If all cars on the road are driverless, they can communicate much better and have much less risk for accidents, unlike with human drivers who can only control the car so well. The automated cars will be directly linked to brake systems, so if there is a need to brake, the car is hydroplanning, or another emergency is occuring, the computer system onboard the car can easily and effectively stop the car from spinning out by applying specific amounts of brake to each tire, as explained in section 5 of the story. Another safety measure taken with driverless cars is the ability for a human to take over. Google's driverless car will notify its passengers if they need to take over the wheel, as explained in section 7 because the task on the road is too difficult for the car to perform. Assurance of the ability for a human to still control the car is very important, since even though the computer systems onboard the car may be very smart, humans have the ability to judge most situations better than any computer can.

One counterargument to driverless cars is the loss of jobs. This is not stated in the article, but it would be an issue with driverless cars regardless. Many people working as taxi drivers, trash truck drivers, freight truck drivers, or any job involving driving can lose their jobs. This is a problem, especially in the US where there is already a shortage of jobs. Although driverless cars will bring many benefits, the cons of them have to be talked about as well.

Driverless cars are a scary prospect. The thought of a car driving itself can make many people uneasy. If done correctly, however, driverless cars can revolutionize the way that many things today work. With companies such as Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan planning to have fully automated and driverless cars on the road and ready to go by 2020, driverless cars are just that much closer to becoming a reality.

E249399CA04E,"Driverless cars are the future of the roads. They provide an easier way to get to and from different locations, and can help prevent deadly and dangerous accidents. With driverless vehicles, they would prevent wasting excess gas due to them being programmed to be economically efficient. It would also provide a less stressful enviroment for the passengers allowing them to not worry about getting lost due to the gps in the computer driven cars.

Driverless cars will help preserve the enviroment by not using excess gas. ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" A future with driverless public transportation would make the lives of people easier. Having driverless cars become a full on public-transport taxi systerm would help prevent the amount of non enviromentally friendly vehicles driven on a daily basis. Driverless cars with the use of sensors would prevent many car accidents and traffic situations if programmed correctly. ""Futher improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" There will be fewer traffic problems if driverless cars took over. There are companys working on improving how driverless cars handle traffic situations. ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Although driverless cars are not one hundred percent self driven, it is still good to allow the driver to take over when they want to or need to. WIth the addition to alerts and warnings telling the driver if the car needs to be manually controlled, it allows for a even safer enviroment. Once these ""smart"" cars have been proven safer, many states may soon open up to the use of the driverless car. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.

They will allow better traffic conditions and prevent more accidents. There will have to be certain laws that come into effect concerning driverless cars, but overall they would provide a safer, healthier enviroment for everyone.

Driverless cars are an innovative new idea, and this idea needs to be taken to the streets and incorporated into the life of an everday human.

Driverless cars are an an ingenius invention. Driverless cars bring many great aspects to the table.

In paragraph one, the article sates, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus.""

Many people believe there would be too many legal issues with driverless cars. If the car were to malfunction and crash, who would be at fault? In paragragh nine, the passage states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" These lines from the passage leave the open question of whose fault it would be in the case of an accident.

In paragraph 7, the passage states, "" The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This exerpt from the passage shows that while the car is driving itself, the driver should still be paying attention. The manufacturers should make it clear that there is a risk of an accident, but it will be the drivers fault in that case. The driver has a decision to make, they can sit back, or they can pay attention.

First, I highly beilive that drierless cars with not always be 100% driverless. I say that because there will always be a situation where i beilive a driver inside of a car will need to take control of the vehicle. For example if there is a car that is completly driverless and there are workers doing work on a road and you have to go aroung and area of the street, or you have to go on a diferent side of a street, im pretty sure a car cant notice when they need to go aroung something. Also what if you car has a glitch and starts geting out of control, or if there is ice on the road and your car starts to slide how will a compute learn to reacte to situsations like that, ask yourself that. Thats why i think they will never be 100% driverless.

Secondly, they would be very dangerouse. i beilive they would be dangerouse because, suppose there is a child playing and they suddenly run out in the street, i dont think a computers reaction time will be ablr to stop in time to not hit that kid. Also if you car has some type of glitch what is the pasengers in the car going to do if no one can get the car back in control. Then like a stated before if there is bad weather and something happens i think a human being can react to something like that way better than a computer car would. Thats why i think they are dangerouse.

Lastly i think they are a waist of time. I say that beacuse to me i dont think they will never be able to make a 100% driverless car. Honestly they would need alot of things and new machines to make up something like that, and i just dont think there is that much time in a life time. Also it would take alot of money, and i dont think no company will take the risk of putting all that money into something so risky such as a driverless car. Thats why i say its a waist of time.

As crazy and far-fetched as it may seem, computercontrolled cars ,may soon be taking over. Driverless cars may be one of the greatest inventionsin recent Years.

The driverless car could solve so many problems that we all encounter daily on the road. For example, driverless cars can solve the issue of speeding. Since there is a computer controlling the car it will always drive the speed limit, saving people money and lives. Also, a computer will never get tired so there is no worrries of falling asleep at the wheel which can also help prevent many late-night accidents. Lastly, driverless cars can help prevent the growing epidemic of texting and driving, as will as drunk driving.

With driverless cars taking over the road, this can help keep everyone safe on the road and prevent thousands of accidents. With a computer controlling the car that knows everything there is to know about driving safely, this can help insure one's safety while traveling via car. Of course there will be situaions that a human driver is more skilled than the computer, such as when there is heavy traffic and/or weather conditions. With time and a better understanding, the driverless cars will learn to adapt to these situations.

220E4E7047C0,"I think that we should have driverless cars. There are multiple reasons that I believe this, like fewer accidents and safety reasons.

For one thing, like stated above, there would most likely be fewer accidents. So far, according to paragraph 2 ""their cars have driven more than half a million miles without an accident."" Though the cars are not ""truly driverless,"" the fact remain that even though they still need human drivers to navigate through certain spots, and still haven't crashed, they are pretty impressive. The driver would also be able to take over the vehicle, if needed, to get through road construction, and getting around accidents. If the driving technology were to malfunction, the driver would simply take over the driving until they can get to a safe spot to pull over or call for help. It is a great safety feature.

Speaking of safety features, these autonomous cars have many of them. The notify the driver when they need to take over. According to paragraph 7 GM has ""developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" Google car ""announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" Others consider flashing likghts and other heads-up displays. There is also the possibility of less pollution.

The cars that Sergey Brin forsees ""would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" With pollution being a major problem around the world, especially in places that are high in the industry business, we could use cars like that. Eventually that kind of fuel saving would go into other cars. These fuel saving cars could be the first step toward a greener world.

Google is one of the leaders in driverless cars, and the cars have been able to successfully drive over half a million miles without an accident. However, there are major safety issues to consider with these cars such as pedestrians, passengers, and system malfunctions.

Trying to figure out how these driverless cars work with other cars, some may forget that there are pedestrians by our road ways as well. The driverless cars of today need some help from the passengers they are carrying when in work zones and around accidents. Would the car without a full time driver be able to sense a small human being walking by it and be able to stop? Probably not, even with LIDAR, a laser beam that makes 3-D models of its surroundings, there are some things that technology cannot comprehend.

If a passenger is not driving what do they do? In this day and age, they will probably turn to their cell phones for entertainment. Driverless cars of today still, once again, need assistance from their human load, and if a driver is distracted when the car needs it most, it could possibly be fatal to many. Manufacturers are trying to eleviate this problem by bringing new entertainment systems that will occupy and get the drivers attention. The entertainment feature in driverless cars could be considered a safety feature if used in the proper way.

We have all dealt with a system malfunction, most commonly in cell phones, and what says that these driverless cars will be any different. Electronics short out when exposed to water, and most of the sites that these new cars are being tested at are relatively warm and dry. Will these cars work in Chicago were they get heavy snow?

New things happen all the time when driving on a regular basis in less than optimal conditions and trying to compute all these new things and storing them away for later could be to much for the system to handle.

Driverless cars could be a good use if you are traveling many miles on a deserted high way, but not in a practical everyday way.

There are pros and cons of this idea. Even though I think a driverless car is a good idea there needs to be improvements and more work on these cars. A pro of this invention is it can take you where you need to go and is pretty much safe. For example, a driverless car would be great for someone that is intoxicated that needs to go home. Even if someone is intoxicated that person would still need a designated driver because the car needs a human driver that must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires, as stated in paragragh 7. Another pro, which is stated in paragragh 8, is ""some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the drivers need to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" That is a great safety feature about this car.

DA908CE23E53,"The topic of driverless cars is highly debabated today, and will continue to be in the near future. Each side has many pros and cons that they can bring to the table but I believe that there is one argument that is bettere than the other. I believe that driverless cars would not serve a significant purpose in our society today for many reasons.

The name driverless goes to tell that a human would not need to operate the vehicle. This is not true, in fact driverless cars can not yet function without a human behind the wheel. These cars cannot handle driving in things like road construction or avoiding an accident. These cars can drive on the roads if traffic is not a big issue, or if there is not any construction or detours that need to be taken, but if you live in an area where these things are common, it would simply not be wroth your money to purchase one of these vehicles.

Another reason that i do not support driverless cars is that driving one of these cars could cause more accidents than there are right now. if the operator of the car is not paying attention to their surroundings, and the car cannot handle a certain situation an accident is almost certain to happen. Also, in the case of an accident that is caused by the technology, who is at fault, the driver or the car manufacturer? New laws wouold have to be implemented to solve daunting issues like these. Things like insurance companies would have to also adapt to these new cars hitting the road by devising new policies for the people that own a technologically advanced car like these.

Another reason that i am against driverless cars is that these cars could potentially take away thousands of jobs. If driverless cars can replace taxi drivers, thousands of people will be put out of work. These cars may be good for long road trips, but they are not as good as navigating big city traffic as a human is. Humans can make quick decsions and may be able to avoid these accidents. Plus, there is often road work being done, and can stretch on for miles, and humans can handle route changes and detours better than technology.

These are many reasons that humans are better suited to drive cars. Technology will continue to advance, and will get smarter, but will it be safe enough to use without someone overseeing it to make sure that no mistakes happen?

What if the driver is intoxicaded and doesn't pay attention to what the car is saying. What if the car starts to mess up and the driver looses control of the car. There is so many things that can go wrong with this espicially now there are so many things going on with texting and driving and drinking and driving. Imagine the accidents that can happen.

What if the driver wakes up super early one day and are driving to work. They have the driverless car driving and they fall asleep because there not moving or doing anything simply because the car is driving itself you know how bad that accident can be? If you have a regular car that you control you will have to stay awake because you are the on moving it and controlling it but if you have the driverless car you arent really doing anything but trying to stay careful and paying attetention which can cause you to fall asleep. I don't see this has being safe what so ever so many things can go wrong so many people can get hurt. What if the driverless car messes up and they blame the driver and not the manufacturer many people would get angry.

If they really want this to happen there should be so many rules in the car. Some can be that every passanger has to have a seatbelt or the car won't move, the driver must have both hands on wheel the entire time the car is in motion. Not a single car can be to full. Loud alert signals when something is going to happen to aware the driver. A voice check to see who is driving etc.. It does sound appealing knowing you are going to get in a car and not have to drive it but me being safe and the others on the car are way more important then me being happy. I would rather be happy and safe and drive my own car then to depend on a car computer that can break down anyday.

Driverless cars are just not something that sounds safe what so ever. If you have someone driving for you then whats the point of learning how to drive learning how to park taking your time studying and preparing for the test all of that will be useless if you have a car that drives on its own most of the time. You know how many teenagers are going to try to take there parents driverless car just because it drives on its own and they know they won't get pulled over because the car is driving perfect. Many people are going to think its okay to be on drugs and intoxicaded because they wont have to worry about there driving.

This is just not well what so ever. There so many things wrong with this idea it can cause many problems. Many people are going to take advantage of the car. There's some people that are responsible but theres also many people that aren't.    ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
68D614933A4B,"The future technologies are improving, and the driverless car becomes popular these days. People dream about driving without the driver; car of course, taxi, bus, train, and air plane. It can bring us convenience. A lot of companies already started working on their driverless vehicles project, it will take huge part of the market in the future.

Driverless car can lead our future technology. It seems useful and practical. However, everything has their pros and cons, so does driverless car. In my opinion, driverless car can't driving without the driver, but it can help drivers drive easily and safely. Here is my articles to support my opinion.

First, it can ruin people's job. A lot people make money from working in the transportation company, if driverless car gets popular, nobody will need a taxi driver or a bus driver anymore. Pilots of trains and planes will no longer needed as well. It is hard to get a job these days even if you graduate the decent college, the driverless car will make this worse.

Second, the sensors and auto systems can help the drivers to drive, but it can't control all process of driving. Sometimes the computer doesn't work properly as our desktops or laptops do, it can cause errors any time. Sometimes driving needs human's ability, especial it's a sudden situation.

Third, the problem of responsibility. For example, if your driverless car hits the person in front of you, it is ambiguous to figure out who has the responsible for the accident. The car company, and the customers will argue to blame each other.

Driverless car can bring convenience to us. It seems very helpful, but it also has obivous problems. People are improving technologies right now at this time as well. But the important thing is people should think more carefully of pros and cons of the future technologies rather than just chasing the benefit in front of them. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6D604F2CC3B1,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. The idea of automatic cars has been around for a long time. Technology was not as advanced as it is now. Improvements in computer software is going to help make driving safer and is leading to cars that can handle more difficult tasks on their own.

Having driverless cars is a great idea. There are a lot of benifits of having driverless cars. In paragraph 1 it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world"". Having driverless cars would lower the number of deaths and crashes. Imagine someone being drunk and wanting to drive home. Having a driverless car would help that situation a lot less dangerous.

There are a lot of negative things about driverless cars. Having one of these cars would still require attention and assistance. In paragraph 7 it states, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. The necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs"". If someone is drunk or on drugs how will they know when a problem occurs? Not everyone is going to be fit to have a driverless car.

There are a lot of things a driverless car can do much better than a human can do. In paragraph 7 it states, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph...They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves..."". If a person is unable to break fastly the car will do it. Having a automatic car can help the person worry less because the car will help get them to their destination safely and hopefully on time. Maufacturers are also going to consider using cameras to watch the drivers and make sure they are focused on the road. An automatic car would be good in a situation if someone gets a phone call or a text message. Even though they are supposed to be watching road it will still make it less dangerous. In paragraph 8 it says, ""..Something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern"".

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are both positive and negative aspects for driverless cars. There are more positive things about a driverless car than negative. Some say why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW manager driver states, "" We have to interpert the driving fun in a new way"". The idea of driverless cars will further be an idea and the negatives will be improved. Maybe one day there will be a true driverless car.      ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Yes, its true that there are cars now that can break one their own, warn the driver if something is in close contact and more. How ever, the entire time there is a driver in control at ALL TIMES. There is not a moment where the car alone is moving. Another reason driveless cars is not a wise desision is that its illegal to even test drive one in many places. For exsample; Califorina, Nevada Florida, and the District of Colimbia. Alose, law makers know that saftey is best achived with alert drivers.

Smart cars are not so smart. They in danger lives with un-foced drivers, and are not even ligel everywhere. Humans are not ready for such an advanced way of transpertation quite yet.

The driver has to stay aware of the other things around them. Even thought you still have to keep your hands on the wheel because of the touch sensors. The article states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This statment shows there is still room for human error in these driverless cars.

Even though human error is still involved, these cars still can't go through construction areas or around wrecks but they still alert you when you come across it.

the prompt states, ""But all are designed when the road requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around acciedents. this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" People are still needed to drive these cars, but we still have to do the hard part the old fashion way.

Even with accident warning, these cars are still not legal in some states like California and Nevada. For example, ""As a result it is illegal even to test computer- driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars."" They don't Think it's safe enough to be driven in highly populated areas.

These driverless cars are a hazard. even though they could be helpful in the future. In some way they seem to undertested amd people don't want to trust them. Manly because you would still have to pay attention to the road, still have to drive through construction and wrecks, and are technically still not fully legalised in some states like California, Nevada and Florida.

Knowing the goods and bads about these special cars can be good for the future when investing in one some day. Having a car that can drive itself, communicate with you and your actions, interact with how you drive could be a good thing. What if something was to go wrong? Being able to know how these things works and whats good and not so good about them could, never know, save your life.

These new and improved cars have positive things about them. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a car. Half a million miles is quite a lot without anything going wrong. it goes to show they can be reliable when wanting to drive a greater distance. There is more about these self-driving cars many dont know. Gm had developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in a danger of backing into an object. Therefor, the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Today, we don't exacly know how or what these self-driving cars are going to have in them or how they may run in the future. There are many positive things that have come upon us when investigating in this new invention but what could possibly go wrong? During the making of these cars there is a lot of technology and a whole lot of sensors. While driving thses cars, lets say on the highway, and something was to go out or mountfunction. Yes, it could happen to any vehicle in the world. The only problem is if the car itself is driving and something was to happen would the driver be able to take control or would the car freeze everything up an something bad happen? Google, BMW, and anyone else involved in this think of all the good possible things but there could be so many negatives that could really be lifechanging.

My opinion on Diverless cars is good for the most part. Say you have to drive a long ways and you need a break from driving, the car could take over instead of having to stop at night and drive for you. Its crazy to think that in a few years these cars could become our lives. ""Telsa has projectd 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" ( Driveless Cars are Coming.)

So, as you think more about it, most positive things could also be negative things when it comes to self-driving cars. In a few years havinng these cars could change our lives or make them harder. From the cars driving a half a million miles to having gadgits to help you focus on driving to not so much the technology problems that could cause bad news for a lot of people.

93969C0A04CC,"My opinion on the driverless car is a big two thumbs up, I think these cars are a big stepping stone in the world of technology, letting us advance to create more useful creations to help our daily lives. Driverless cars can help evolve our future, at least our future in technology, and help us create more wonderful inventions. The best part is the cars that Sergey Brin sees in the future will not even use as much fuel that we use today, it will only require half that amount.

I believe it to be very fascinating that for a car to be smarter it will need many sensors all over it. This way the car would be able to copy a human's skill at the wheel. The sensors attached to the car will allow it to apply brakes whenever danger is coming up ahead. We are unfortunately very lucky to have that ability to attach sensors onto the car to provide it the intelligence of driving on it's own, since back then we never had any sensors, computers, or mapping made by google.

Recapping my opinon on these driverless cars, I would like to say that they are great to have for transporting people who can't drive and delivering packages or whatever else they need to be used for. One more thing about having driverless cars is that it's useful for parent's, while the car drives to their destination, they will be able to take care of their children without having to stop the car.

These cars have great potential to change the world of transportation. The cars have positive and negative aspects, but I believe that driverless cars will be a positive effect on the world.

Driverless cars could change the transportation. It would make it easier to go place to place. Driverless cars could prevent accidents from occurring in everyday traffic. These cars would be much safer than a car with a reckless driver. Millions of car accidents happen every year, but driverless cars could potentially prevent most of these accidents. With a driverless car, the passengers are safer because the car is programmed to work well. If there was an emergency, someone could take the wheel and have control of the car.

Driverless cars have great potential for public transportation. Driverless cars could act like a taxi or bus system. This system of driverless cars would safe people money by not owning their own car. It would be safer to have many of these cars. Millions are killed in drunk driving accidents, and these cars would give potential drunk drivers an alternative way to get home safely. These cars could be used in a public transportation system to help people travel in their every day lives.

Driverless cars are approaching quickly, and there must be decisions made on their involvement of people's lives. These cars would be safer than reckless drivers on the road.

0909F689A892,"Self driving cars are mystifying to some people, and the thought is a great fantasy that some want to see come true. While fantasies are fun to think about not all of them should come true. These are my three reasons as to why we should not go into this business.

So, imagine you wake up for work, everything is going alright, and you get in your brand new self driving car. It was tested by Google, so you think everything will be okay. The car pulls out of the drive and you're on your way to work. You're speeding up faster and faster, but you reassure yourself that everything is fine. The car doesn't stop at the approaching stoplight, which results in you getting in a crash.

The car is totaled, you're in the hospital, and it's all because your self driving car bugged out. Sure, more and more cars can be tested to ensure that there will be no bugs, but then there are people in this world that are mean. This sort could either have nothing to do with what I'm saying, or they could hack into your car and take control. For what reason that I don't know, but it's still a con of the self driving idea.

After this crash you go to sue the manufacturer of this car. The manufacturer says he has nothing to do with it, it's not his fault, so you have no right to sue him. This gets you in the long process of court duty, a lot of research, and stress builds up. It wasn't your fault, you think, the manufacturer could've made it safer. Maybe he could have done a few more test runs.

The manufacturer comes back at you saying that you bought the car, and therefore should of thought about the consequences that could commence. This lawsuit goes on and on until finally they ask the jury, and they decide that you're guilty. They say that you should have thought of the reprucusions, you lose the fight that you started, and to top it off you've lost even more money.

Apart from that visual story I've laid out for you there is also this to consider, why have self driving cars? Shouldn't humans have the intellect and mind capacity to be able to drive in a giant metal box to get to their job? If we're so capable we should drive to our workplaces and homes. It's not just a fantasy that some people thik about, it's also the aspect of laziness in America.

Think about it, the self driving cars make us do one less thing in our lives. It's an important thing too! Driving down the road where you have to trust other people in their cars and in your ability to drive your car. What would we do in our cars then? The car would basically be a very weirdly based time machine that we hop in. We'd be texting in the car, checking our social media, eating our breakfast on the way to work. We wouldn't realize what's going on around us.

We wouldn't look up at the world outside, we wouldn't see the trees as we pass them or the way that the snow falls on the ground. You won't see the birds on their first or seventy-first flight. The deer in the medow, the squirrels in the tree brances, and the people you pass by. Have you ever driven past one of your friends, honked at them just to see them see you and smile? That connection that you feel then, would no longer be here.

Everyone is so in love with the social media fad. You'd be seeing Celine's status update about her going to the mall with her friends instead of the sunrise.

You'd see your friend's new profile picture and tap the like button while another one of your friends drove past you and honked. That friend still has a self driving car, and they still honk at you so they can see you. You don't look up, they see you relaxing in the front seat checking out your favorite band's Facebook.

Your friend drives away without seeing your smile or wave. They see the squirrels playing together and the birds flying freely. How your friend wishes to be playing with you like when you two were eight years old, and just thought trucks were 'oh so cool'. To be free lke those birds your friend saw, he has that freedom. The freedom to make his own decisions. He's flying away to greater heights while you're stuck on the ground in your self driving metal box.

So, after all of these reasons, the technical issues, the lawsuits, and the progressing laziness that America is becoming; this is why I do not like the thought of self driving cars becoming a thing. We have the freedom to drive and so be it. Don't let the robot or computerized world take your life over. Don't let social media and laziness catch up to you. Be the bird and fly free, not the stone whom corrodes. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
3B61207AD210,"I think driverless cars sound like a good idea on paper, but in the real world they just are not far enough advanced yet for me to feel safe being in or around one.

They are not even fully driverless yet, a person still needs to be ready to take the wheel at any given time.

However in the future when they become more advanced and safe they could potentialy prevent accidents.

I think driverless cars are still a thing of the future and not present.

As much as I think they need work now, I am not against the development of them as they could bring many potential benefits.

In the article it states how movies and television shows have been fascinated with driverless cars for a long time, seeing them as a thing of the future.

I think they still are a thing of the future because they still need a driver to be able to take the wheel at any given time.

The only way I can see them being the safest they can be, is if all cars are driverless and they could interact with each other.

Right now the driverless cars are mostly just assisting like antilock brakes, as stated in pararaph six.

When the technology eventually becomes good enough to be able to fully drive without a driver there are still laws to be discussed.

Only a few states allow them so far, and what good is a car that is only legal in three states and the District of Columbia if you do not live there.

I think eventually the laws will change enough to allow them to function as long as they are safe and can pass certain tests.

Then the question comes up about blame in the event of an accident, whose fault is it if a computer is controlling the vehicle?

As of now driverless cars seem to be more trouble than help.

With time I feel that they could become very safe and reliable vehicles with advancements in technology.

There are many manufacturers trying to make driverless cars, at least one of them is bound to make something good eventually.

Driverless car can be a bad idea because looking at technolog these days, it does alway work properly and that could lead to the cars. if some wrecks another car that would mean that it would be the cars fault but all the blame would be one the ""driver"". No one would know how it happened properly because there would be indication on how it happened.

Another reason why this would be a bad reason to have drverless cars was that the speed would be the same for everyone and some people may be in a hurry to get to places and the cars would take only the main roads to get to their destination. If the car wasn't used right it would mean that many people would be in danger to reckless people in the world.

The last problem with this kind of car would be when the person in the driver seat won't pay attention to the road and they get hurt for it. Many people in the world would be get hurt because they aren't doing anything and think that they would be perfectly safe and they won't.

I think it is a geat idea if we could get them to be where there would be no wrecks or accidents involving them.

These cars copuld be a major blessing or a dreadful curse to humans. A lot of humans already hate driving in the first place, would they even listen to the car telling them that they need to take over the wheel. It all seems like such a lot of time and money to do so. The world is working perfectly fine without driverless cars. Nothing is more trustworthy than the human hand itself.

63C99FAA6547,"I think that driverless cars would be a very positive thing. Thre big reasons for this are that without drivers there would be less aciidents, they would be more efficient wih gas, and there would be no need for insurance. So overall a big improvement on todays society.

Firstly without drivers there would be less accidents. Now since since not everyone would be able to afford using them there will still be accidents butz the number will be drasticly reduced. Since the car is driving itself there is no way that the driver can drive recklessly therefore greatly reducing the number of car crashes. So even if one of the drriverless cars gets into an accident it would be the manufacturer's fault because they are the ones hat are really driving here. So overall a lot safer than what we have now.

My next reason is that these cars a lot more gas efficient. The reason I say this is that they would always obey the speed limit exactly. Doing this should cut down on the gas used and therefore be much more efficient. In the long run this sabes everyone money except the gas stations.

Lastly this should decrease the need for insurance. In the article they said that these would be more like a taxi service so if they are taxi than no need for people to have insurance on cars. If everyone used these than no more need for car insurance at all. Which in turn saves even more money for people. So overall very good cost wise for people.

The smart car can also help with drives who slowly fall asleep at the wheel so they can take it easy but not fall asleep while driving because if the smart car is driving, but the human driver still has to be alert at all times because they may come across a road that takes human skill driving to go through like work site`s, accident`s,etc . In a negative way they can be a bad idea because what if there is a mechanical malfunction with the car itself like a problem that the owner of the car couldnt fix by hand because it had to be done by machines or experts then you wouldnt have a car for the time being . A driverless car still has to have human supervision because basically the human drivier still has to watch the road and watch for pedestrians , animals , and other objects or things going into the road . The smart car has positive and negative things towards it we dont know for sure if we should bring them into the world until the technology becomes even to where they can fix the negative things about them  ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
03CA365DDC67,"What would it be like to have a driverless car? If cars could drive on their own many of the mistakes that humans make on the roads would be eliminated, causing less accients and less injuries from car crashes. Driverless cars would make the roads a safe place and cause less stress on the person controlling the car.

Driverless cars are built to allow the car to steer, accelerate, and brake on its own. With these features it would cause less people trying to speed passed each other for going to slow, or cause the driver to not have to take a sharp stop because they we going to quick for a yellow light. The car are also built with a laser beam the would show a 3-D model of the surrounding of the driver, which allows it to know everything that is happening and how to react. If there is some construstion going on ahead or a crash the car also alarms the driver to take control.

Not only are the different types of cars that can cause accidents, but the person behind the wheel too. With there being so many different types of people driving everyday such as: new drivers, elderly, and careless drivers, it would be great to have a car that would control all the different gears that the driver would usually have to do. Since so many teen drivers think that they can text while driving or goof around, an accident is bound to happen, some worse than others, but still they then have to pay for the damage, but with the driverless car it allows the vieicle to take control of the wheel and cause the crash to never happen. Also when it comes to elderly or drunk drivers they never fully have an eye out for what can happen and are not quick enough to react to it, so if the car can pull the brakes on its own then that would save another situation to never happen.

Since the road is such a dangerous place there is no room for texting or making a mistake. It seems like driverless cars are the right thing to do since so many people get in crashes, or cause death from an accident. Driverless cars seem to be the safe choice, and can save many lives.

AE8891205D90,"Driverless cars are coming, but they may not be the future most people are hoping for. Of course people want one--it is new and cool, but it will not be what they expected. Driverless cars would extremely expensive with all of the technology they are using. Also, it could be very dangerous without an alert driver ready to step in. There are several problems with driverless cars becoming humanity's future.

One problem is money--how will people be able to afford these driverless cars? For example, Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. The combination of all of these is absolutely necessary for the driverless car to have the skill of a human at the wheel. The combination of all of these is also very costly. Only a minority of the population would be able to buy such a car, and just because they're able to, doesn't mean they will be willing to. Many people might think the car isn't worth that much money if they can drive themselves. Economic problems will always be around.

Another issue is the danger of driverless cars. Nowadays, sensors can detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers and can cause the car to apply brakes by itself. It is a brilliant plan, but what happens when it does not work? Technology cannot always be perfect; it is bound to have glitches at some point. If manufacturers do bring in in-car entertainment and information systems so that the driver will not get bored, that means that the driver will not be alert and ready. For example, if the car's automatic brake system does not work, and the driver is not paying attention, there could be a serious crash with many people getting injured. Technoloy should not be relied upon because there is not a 100 percent guarentee of it always working.

In theory, driverless cars are an excellent idea. However, when they're actually applied and put to use, it is not going to have the best results. Many people may want a driverless car, but how will they get one if they cannot afford it? Not everyone has money just lying around, ready to buy a driverless car that would cost a fortune. In addition, the risk factor is too high. So many things could go wrong which could result in people actually getting injured. Driverless cars may be what humanity wants, but it is definitely not what they need.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
07A33D32260B,"Google field-tested a driverless car that drove five hundred miles with only one accident, which was when a human was driving the car. Driverless cars are hardly a new idea, but recently in the 21st century, it has become more and more of a reality. Ever since 2009 ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions"" (Author). Driverless cars haven't been perfected yet and still rely on human assitance now and then, but with a few more years of research they could mass-produced.

Driverless cars should be used to replace current cars, trucks, and buses. They could be used like taxis and would use half as less fuel than what current taxis use. Additionaly, they are more manueverable than buses and are more practical for wide-spread use. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes ""such cars would fundamentally change the world"" (Author). If the future he envisions is to become reality, then there are some barriers that need to be broken through.

Currently, driverless cars have to rely on human drivers to manuever through roadwork, accidents and other complicated traffic issues. We have yet to acquire sensors and technology advanced enough to handle situations like these. That hasn't stopped companies like Google who ""modified [a] Toyota Prius [that] uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the reaviwe mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor"" (Author). This car, dubbed LIDAR, cannot drive on its own as of yet. Other companies have just been developing driving assistants such as BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". Another big problem for companies trying to advance cars is states themselves. Since most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, most states have made illegal to even test computer-driven cars because lawmakers believe ""safety is best achieved with alert drivers"" (Author). States like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Still, manufacturers believe that ""more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe"" (Author). Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.

While completely driverless cars are somewhere in the distant future, and most people are still apprehensive about them, the impact that driverless cars can have on the economy and the world is astounding. As more and more years go by, companies are getting closer and closer to figure out this complex equation. People will just have to get used to this new advancement in technology and move on because these cars can make a difference.                 ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

This also could help to prevent accidents like with long drives, if you fall asleep, no problem the car drives on its own and can prevent a terrible crash from occuring. If you choose to go out drinking and then try to drive the car brings you back home safely.

So in conclusion driverless cars are an intellegent idea.

44E5F6595A48,"Driverless cars, I feel like its a disaster waiting to happen. As we exploring the world of cars and what they can teach us we will have a few bumps along the way. This is one of those bumps. Driverless cars will defeat the purpose of the 16 year old child earning freedom and driving on his or her own. It's not fair to the current generations that they won't be able to drive like past generations have.

If you pull text from the 8th paragraph it staes rather clearly that it's not really developed the way they wanted it. It's more like roadside assistance. But the driver would get rather bored waiting on his or her turn to drive, if they even get a turn. This is just one of the many negatives of driverless cars. The law in many states say that and driver needs to be present and in control but California, Flordia, Nevada and the District of Columbia are starting to allow it. People out there are starting to believe that it's the next great thing and that all the other states willl follow alot like the rise of homosexuality.

Now don't get me wrong the idea of a driverless cars seems pretty cool and the world would love the change but is it worth it? Think of the thousands of taxi drivers and limo drivers that would be out of work. Think of the people that work at the BMWs, they would be out of jobs and wouldn't be able to provide for the families they have. Is it all worth the unemployment line filling us in busy towns because the cabs have no reason to be driven?

The passage also allows the reader to wonder what would happen if the car malfunctioned. Would it be the drivers fault or the companies fault? This could simply be avoided and that makes lives alot easier and even though you have to go through task of teacher the newer generations to drive wouldn't that be eaier than taking and risk and possibly dying beacuse you wanted to use a driverless car.

The passage also states they've already got a phase A of the driverless car. Google has presented a car that can drive up to 25 miles per hour with no issues until it needs help swearving throughout traffic. Then and only then will the driver be able to control the car. Other than that the car is just a no driver needed car unless a situation happens. This also could upset the driver because they might've wanted to drive but they have to wait his or her turn to control the car. This could also cause many issues and it's a huge possiblity that the car accident rate can and will increase because of the malfuntions of the car.

In short this passage can be connceted to Surealism. This whole idea is a figure of someone's imagination and they thought it would be rather cool to eleminatedivers as jobs. Think of the taxi and limo drivers they will lose jobs if people have driverless cars. It also defeats the purpose of maing the world a btter place because now there will be homeless people and people needing jobs that aren't avalible to them.

Of course the driver can take over a situation of an accident or work zones, the car will always need some human skills, as it's states on the article. Even though these people aren't so familiar in driving they can still do it in these small situations. How? Because the car is going to have a lot of new technology, the car can explain what to do during those situations.

Driverless cars can be safe. They can be safe because its going to have a lot of technology that can warn you when you and the vehicle is in danger. The car is going to be equiped by vibrating seats when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The car will also have flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. The article also states that the car is also going to have cameras watching the drivers and making sure they are focused on the road. This driverless car can be safe in many ways with the stuff equiped that helps prevents any danger.

347D6A056DBE,"In ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" technology shows just how far it has come. Mankind has passed up cellphones and televisions and now we have self driving cars. What is the point in not utilizing this great invention? Although driverless cars may seem to have a few faults like within the laws, driverless cars are are a brilliant, safe invention that everyone should own.

The first and possiby best reason for people to adapt to driverless cars is the car's safety. Now in driving, little human error can occur, Ulitmately leading to safer roads. The only time there could be human error is when people actually take the wheel to back out. It is also proven that they are safer becuase the test automated cars have not crashed yet. This achievement may be credited due to the sensors on the car. Compare the crash free cars to the amount of crashes involved with humans everyday and driverless cars seem like a nessecity.

Today we have GPS and other systems to help us reach locations, but those are not always pefect. They can give false direction. Also, people can and will still mess up with these devices because humans are full of flaws. The answer to this again lies within driverless cars. Humans can mess up any dirrections but if people could just tell the car where to go and it took them there then the problem would be solved! Imagine no more getting lost or not noing where to go. The driverless car can do just that for humanity.

Some may say, ""what happens when there is a crash? Who is at fault"" The simple answer to this is whoever is controlling the vehicle is at fault. ""How would anyone know if the person or car was driving."" Another simple answer; install a camera that shows the driver and the driver only. This way, people could find out who was actually in control and caused the crash thus removing the flaw of the driverless car.

The driverless car, some thought it would never be a reality, but it finally is. This car proves to be safer, can stop people from getting lost, and has no more fault within the laws behind it if it were to crash. The car that requires no driver is here and people need to utilize the opportunity.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
24D3888C8FD4,"I am for the use of self driving cars, most accidents that happen on the road are due to humman error. self driving cars are one safer due to reduced human error, they are more cost efected due to the fact that once all cars are self driving they will no longer need road signs as cars can communicate with each other, and also due to that fact it is more time effective and in being time effective will be more cost effective as well.

Humans error accounts for 90% of all road way accidents the other precent is due to mechanical failure. As Google has shown with it having driven more than half a milion miles without a crash that cars are cappable of being safe, you can make the argument humans are in these cars but the car only alerts the human inside if it can not make it through the problem its self, which these problems such as accidents are caused by human error to begin with the car can not account for something that is not supposed to happen because it should not happen with all self driving cars. which leads me to my next point that it will be better for the goverment and tax dollars.

Self driving cars are computers they can communicate with each other, they are programmed to read the road and communicate where they are and how fast they are going to the cars around them so all the appropriate changes to speed can be made in a fashion that humans cant due because we can communicate to each other from 2 miles away, and since humans no longer need to communicate at all all road signs that are required not to ensure that traffic knows where its going will be a thing of the past. with this out of the way there is no more need for upkeep of these signs and communication devices they can be taken down and recycled for something of more use or recycled for money saving tax dollars while also making the envioment better by reducing all the cluter along the road ways. it will also shorten how much time is taken to reach a destination which might just extend out time on earth.

Time is the most limiting factor in someones day, you can do a lot of things but you cant just make time out of thin air. commutes in the city of Las Angeles can take hours just because of traffic. with cars that communicate these times would be reduced so signifigantly they would be minimal to none, therfore if this was to happen we would save so much on gas, emmisions on cars would be lower causeing less money to go to making the air cleaner, green house effect would go down due to emmisions being less. This by its self might make it so we can stay on the earth longer cars make up a lot of emmision that goes into polluting our air, so in turn you might just be saving yourself from getting cancer if you switch to a car that gives off little to no emmsions. You might even be able to save money by swtiching to a self driving car, the Goverment could give tax subsides to those who buy the car becuase it saves on accidents, emmisions, and taxes to keep the signs up. another point is insurance, you would no long need insurance beacuse accidnets would no longer be a problem saving you thousands of dollars over your lifetime.

self driving cars are the way to a better and more safe future, they dont have the human error that accounts for 90% of all wrecks that happen on the road today. they are more effect for taxes sake causing our taxes to go to something you might actually want funded like school, the possiblities are endless. lastly they are just going to save you money, tax subsides from the Goverment, insurance isnt required anymore, and it saves you time allowing you to do what you really want to do with our day.

One reason why driverless cars should be banned because of reckless driving. Reckless driving is one of the major deaths we have in the world today. Having cars with no drivers can be very dangerous to the driver and passagers in the car, even the pedestrians on the streets and other cars. As the story states ""... Lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.""

If we allow driverless cars we never know for sure if it is actaully safe to drive them on the road and citzens wouldn't be safe.

Driverless cars would have to have lots of technology to work. ""such as radar sensors , and GPS receiver, motion sensors also"" Driverless cars will cost alot more than a regular car that requires a driver.

If one of your sensors stop working it will cost alot more to get fixed than a regular car. Which also would mean your car would unsafe and undrivable.

Last but not least, my last reason is changing to laws. By having driverless cars require the laws to be changed. Eventually everyone would be forced to buy a driverless car do to the changes of the law. The laws would have to change and it wouldn't be fair to other people with regular cars.

The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. By using driverless cars as a taxi system, gas consumption would majorly decrease.

46E97FDCA469,"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" was a interesting factual article to read. My opion on driverless cars is they're not a good idea. I am against driverless cars. My reasons for this are an increasing rate of accidents, technology failing, and the cost. In the following paragraphs are reasons why I am against the ideal of driverless cars.

Starting off, my first reason for being against driverless cars was the increasing rate of accidents. Not all drivers pay attention to the road while driving (especially teens) and riding in a driverless car, coming into a situation that requires a human being to take control of the wheel can lead to accidents if they're not paying attention. The rates of car accidents are already high till this day, just imagine how high the rate would be having driverless cars. It may not even be the drivers fault, a glitch can happen with the car causing it to get into a accident injuring somebody, as said in passage 9; who's fault would it be then? The person or the manufacturers fault? That is my first reasoning opposing driverless cars.

Next, my second reason was the technology failing. We live in a society where technology advances EVERYDAY, but there is always a complications with technology. Updated technology isn't always perfect. For instence the computer system in the car could crash, shutting off the whole car, there might be a hay wire causing the car to spin out of control, causing an accident, and even a more dangerous situation the car could explode or catch on fire due to the technology. An example of today's most updated piece of technology that went bad is the ""Hoover Board,"" many people could just be riding on it, and it could burst into flames. The same thing could happen with driverless cars.

Lastly, my last reasoning was the cost put into the car. Many companies say they plan to have driverless cars by the year 2020, the amount of the Driverless Car would be a ridiculous amount of money. If someone were interested into buying it the first thing, they should ask themselves ""is it worth it?"" Knowing the bad outcomes that could possibly happen. Not only would the car be super expensive, but also having to fulfill the tank with gas, and gas nowadays isn't the cheapest. But the most important question asking yourself before buying the expensive piece of technology, is it really worth how much it costs?

In conclusion, I am against driverless cars. The reasons are, increasing rate of accidnets, technology failing, and the cost. I myself would not buy this knowing the reprecautions. That is why I am against the ideal of Driverless Cars.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

In 2016, Tesla is planning to release a car that can drive itself 90 percent of the time.

The kind of high-tech equipment it takes to manufacture a car like this hasn't been around for long.

Google has had a type of driverless car since 2009, but before 2000, none of this was possible.

With this rapid advance in technology comes reasonable concern, but the long list of benefits clearly outweighs the costs.

Because of the added safety features and convenience, driverless cars should be developed for all to use.

Driverless cars may seem like a safety risk to some, but in reality, these cars have been enhanced with top-of-the-line technology and have been tested thoroughly.

Google's driverless car uses many different sensors and cameras located all over the vehicle to replicate the ability of a human driver.

One sensor even allows for the creation of a 3-D model of the car's environment.

Sensors similar to these have been used in cars since the 1980s in antilock brakes.

Tried and tested, all the sensors on driverless cars serve only to protect the driver.

Driverless cars can also prevent distracted driving.

Some companies hope to create entertainment systems for drivers not currently controlling the car.

These systems and displays could be turned off right away when the driver has to take the wheel.

Right now, drivers often use cellphones and other distracting devices without the help of this technology.

As Google's cars have driven over half a million miles without a single crash, the combination of all these features has been proven to enhance car safety.

Driverless cars would also be cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and convenient.

Google cofounder Sergey Brin predicts that these cars could form an entire public transportation system, using only half the fuel of today's taxis.

This would save gas money and reduce greenhouse gases at the same time.

It would also allow for more flexibility than a bus or subway system because each driver would be able to personalize their destination.

A car that could drive itself would be magnificent. The self driving car could half the fuel of taxis and save people money. Humans would be relatively safe in a self driving car as well. Google has had driverless cars drive for over half a million miles without any incident. The cars are so fabulous that they alert the driver when entering and exiting driveways in order to have maximum safety and minimal crashes.

The driverless car does have some negative aspects as well. The car cannot completely drive by itself and still needs a driver at the wheel at all times. The driver is needed to assist the car in navigating through difficult traffic situations such as a wreck or a road under construction. The cars can only steer, brake, and accelerate by themselves without having a driver involved. People also argue that the cars could also be dangerous. A car that drives manually is frightening for many people who still want to control how fast or how slow their car is going. Putting trust into a car that could possibly wreck is nerve-wracking for many people.

Even though the self driving car does still need a driver, that doesn't mean the driver actually has to manually brake or accelerate. The car does this on its own without human support. All the driver has to do is help the car navigate through complex traffic problems, which are not an everyday occurance. The driver would rarely have to take manual control of the vehicle. The driverless car is a pinnacle of safety that would keep the drivers safe despite the self driving aspect. The cars have an advanced sensor that would respond to driving accidents far better than a human could. If their was a train that was accelarating faster than a cheetah, the self driving car would respond by braking sooner and quicker than the average human ever could.

The driverless car is an advanced technology that would protect drivers and safely get them to their destination.

What's even better than a car you don't have to worry about driving? A car you don't have to worry about driving, while saving gas. According to the text, Mr Sergey Brin forsees cars that would use half the fuel that taxis use in todays world. Even if it wasnt much, if you add up everyone that rides taxis it accumulates and eventually everyones contributing to the problem. So a car that could use only half of the gas we use today, like is there any reason to say no to these cars?

Many people almost never get anywhere on time, some may have too much going on some might just not care. Whatever the case may be, what if these driverless cars could get you wherever you needed to be in the quickest way possible while not breaking the law. The driverless car could get you where you need to get by taking the quickest route possible. With all the advanced technology being promised the car could know whats ahead of it and if it will slow your trip down. For example if the car knows that up ahead is construction zone where you would have to slow down and waste time, it could just take a more efficient way and eventually save you time.

Driverless cars, hopefully soon, will no longer be a thing of the past. With technology just advancing without stopping i think soon driverless cars would just be another normal vehicle you see on the road. To me driverless cars would be an astounding idea. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B81F04CAAC43,"In my opinion, developing driverless cars is a scary/bad idea. It's true television and movies have been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. They show how they can work good and they show how they can work bad.

Right now Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways, dealing with complicated traffice issues etc. I don't think a program or computer can deal with traffic issues or any of that by themselves. What would happen is someone is actually driving a normal car and some else is driving a computer-driven car and the normal car would break down suddenly?

Computers can and do crash. I don't think these manufacturers can insure that the computer-driven car's computer won't crash. Futurists believe that the key to developing self-driving cars are smarter roads. Engineers at Berkeley did come up with a way to make smarter roads but it's too expensive.

I think that it's going to take a lot of time and money to develop these self-driven cars that we don't need. These cars are going to cause more problems that may be big and small. The states when then have to reconsidered that driving age in my opinion. If the cars are proven to drive themselves do people still have to be older to drive? Would people still have to learn to drive a regular car? Would people be allowed to try people driven cars still? Would there be problems between people driven cars and computer-driven cars? What about drunk people? Could they still drive if they can a computer-driven car?

Tons of laws would have to change also. Most driving laws are focused on keeping drivers, passenger, and pedestrians safe. Lawmarkers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.

Crashes play a big part into way I think developing a computer-driven car is not a great idea. The article says ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" Think about that. I think it all depends on if the computer-driven cars have an emergency program to where the person in the driver's seat can take control of the vehicle.

Computers are bound to crash or have a small problem here and there, but I think a small problem on a computer in a car can be a life and death situtation.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" Driverless cars is a bad idea.

Driverless cars are off the chart because some states such as : California, Nevada, Florida , and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Now thats nowhere near half the country. If driverlsess cars do go on there will need to be more laws and regulations. Driverless cars are off the chart for many ways and reasons.

The author states that "" If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? I personally think it would be the manufactuers fault for 1, making the product. 2, not knowing all things that can go wrong in accidents. And 3, not being able to help the driver out in sisutations like accidents,or traffic jams. Manufacturers would be in charge do to the fact they made the car and they should know everything that goes with the car both good and bad.

Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This statement I feel is so True because if a human isnt in charge of the car then there are many chances bad stuff will happen. But in reality theres a human behind all the computer work and GPS's . But as a person not driving yet I feel if a car is controlled by computers it can cause and led to many accidents and injuries.

Driverless cars may seem ""cool"" to many people, but people need to think about the huge disadvanteges.

The first disadvantage is driverless cars are not safe. Driverless cars have sensors that are supposed to detect and respond to danger. Suppose while the driverless car is turning, one of the sensors does not pick up another car. the driverless car will turn anyway becuase it does not know better, and the cars will crash.

Many people may say one advatage to driverless cars would be not having to to pay attention to the road, and getting to sleep, text, or watch movies instead. Although doing these things would be nice it is not possible with driverless cars. Driverless cars still require the ""driver"" to stay alert incase something happens.

Finally, having driverless cars will cause mant people to lose their jod. Taxi drivers, school bus drivers, and semi drivers would no longer be needed. All these people will be unemployed because of a computer driven car.

Sure, the idea of driverless cars sounds great but technology is not always the most reliable piece of equipment in the world especially if its new technology. If the driverless car malfunctioned think of all the trouble that it would cause. Driverless cars could end up being very dangerous to the everyday community.

The passage states in paragraph one that Google cofounder Sergey Brin can imagine a time in the future where no one buys cars and they all use the driverless variants. If that time really came and children were growing up their whole lives having a car that drives them everywhere without controlling it I believe there skills as a proactive driver would be greatly decreased. In the passage it also states that cars can not completely handle all situations, such as traffic and workzones, so if these problems arise the driver must take over and if the driver has less skill behind the wheel than say a seasoned driver in todays day in age it could cause trouble with the driver not knowing exactly what to do.

Cars have always been something that I really enjoy, and not only just to look at, driving them is one of the most fun activities that I do. Reading the passage about driverless cars basically tells me that the only plus for having a drivleress car is that you have to do a lot less work than you would in a normal human driven vehicle. This shows me the only reason to have a driverless car is to be lazy and I personally believe that laziness is not a good thing.

Driverless cars have a place in the world but I do not believe they have a place in the everyday community. The cars would be a danger, a hinderance on driving skill, and finally something that would kill the fun in being behind the wheel of a car and driving.

C9DFA1392E8C,"Our system of driving has been implemented for a long time now.

Driverless cars would be a huge leap in technology.

There are so many cars on the road right now that require drivers and almost next to no selfdriving cars. Sel driving cars in theory sound like a good idea, but in all reality they aren't.

The first and biggest issue is cost, the self driving car will have nearly everything our current cars have, in addition to all the high tech sensors and a very exspensive Dubbed LIDAR that uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.

Also they're talking about putting in camera's on the rearview mirrors and a camera that watched the driver.

The cost of repairs will be a a necessity because your car will have to be in working order or else it will not drive itself and you will not travel, and in this day and age you have to be able to travel.

The second issue is implementation.

How will driverless cars implement their product into the general populus?

Will there be a mix of driverless cars and driver operated cars?

If so, that sounds dangerous.

Theere is no need for drivers to be on the road with experimentall technology that is new and has never been used.

The chances of a problem or accident are enormous.

The third issue is change, drivers who use this new car will most likely feel a sense that something is missing as in they aren't doing anything like steering or breaking.

They will not be used to this and feel the need to do something that will distrract them from being alert.

Selfdriving cars will be so new and so different that many Americans will shy away because the change is too significant.

In conclusion, there is already a working system in place and to try and change that system on that big of a scale will create numerous problems that may not be solved.

The three big issues are cost, implementation, and change.

The scale at which this change would happen is just too great.

In addition it is too risky to make a slow implementation because the mix of car types would create many problems as well.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Even if people dont like the idea of it its still going to happen. Driverless cars are not going to be any good for our generation.

Driving is something that you will need your full attention for even if the car is self driven it can still screw up. I don't personally see the point of somthing that is not going to help anyone. Chances are that there will be more accidents and more people will be injured or even die because all technology malfunctions at one point or another and there is no stopping that. Technology is a good thing when it is helping people. Times are changing and no one can stop it. In paragraph 9 it says who will be responsible if the car happens to mess up the manufacturer or the driver.

Think to yourself who would you hold responsible. Knowing that all technology malfunctions,not to mention the car would be overly priced just for it to be able to drive without a driver and sense things. Most people like being aware if their surroungings. What if the car stoped and the driverless addition stoped working .You would already be used to not driving and over all forget how to do it. You wouldn't be aware of where you are because you were to busy doing other things then to know your surroundings.

Knowing how to drive makes things easier on you. Technology is not always a good thing. Technology doesn't always work out the way you want it too its easy to look something up and the internet not give you what you want or what's true would you trust your care taking you to where ever? It's easy saying something is better because it has technology incorperated but is that really true.

Some things are better left with out all the added gadgets and I belive a car is one of those things. A car is more reliable when you personaly are controling it. You know where you are going and I think if they want to make additions to are car make tires that don't go flat or make the car fix its self. Knowing how to get places yourself will make things so much easier on you. If your tire goes flat your car can not take you to the nearest area to call someone or get help.

A car that dirves its self? That's outrageous. For decades humans have been driving cars in order to get where they need to go. This talk of self driven cars is absolutely rediculous. First of all, people enjoy driving. second, the car doesnt even drive completly by itself. Lastly, even if you wanted one, its not availiable every where in the counrty. I beleive this car would be a waste of your time and money.

People Enjoy driving. Driving is something that every teenager that i know cant wait to do. Its freeing and relaxing. If your angry just go on a drive and mabey youll feel better after wards. If your sad, go on a drive. People enjoy driving so much because they know that they are in control of what happens.

Wow. The car does not even drive its self completely. According to the article, driverless cars can only do basiC driving skills. Such as: steering , braking,and accelerating by them selves. Which means they would need help if there were to be an accident or people working on the road. They say that the car will alert you when it needs your help, but that means youll just be sitting thre waiting for your turn to drive. Quick question ,who wants to do that? That would be extremely boring and a waste of your time and money. Then, according to the atricle, you would have to have yor hands on the wheel at all times. So you would litterally be sitting in the car just looking out of the window until its your turn to drive.

Lastly, why in the world would you get a car that you couldnt drive anywhere you wanted to go? The article specifically states that only three states and a district allow driverless cars. this is because if you were to get into an accident, they wouldnt know who to put the blame on; you or the maufacturer. That is definetly a saftey hazard if you ask me cause if it is the manufacturer alot of people could get hurt. But besides that why drive buy and expensive car tht you can only dirve on one side of the counry?

In conclusion, the idea of these driverless cars are rediculous because people enjoy driving,they dont dirve completly by themselves and they aren't avaliable everywhere. I beleive that driverless cars are a waste of your time and money. We should just stick to the same old stuff weve been doing.

The first reason why I think it's a good idea is, because if the cars are able to dive themselfs we the people will see less crashes on the rodes. Lets take I-65 for an example we the people see the news and we see and hear about all the crashes that happen on there. We also can look at I-70 as well its not as bad as I-65 though.

Here is another reson I think everyone should have a driverless car. I am a driver of my own. I get scared sometimes when i am on I-65 going to indy or anywhere like that. The reason being I dont want to get hit just going to the mall with some of my friends thats not what I want. This is what i want though. I want to be able to go place to place without hlaf to think or WORRY about any of the stupid people on the rodes.

I mean take a moment to think about how much better the rodes will be if stupid people can not drive places where they want to go. If people wanted to go some where the car will drive them there all we the peopel have to do is sit there and talk and have some fun. wouldn't that be so much fun though. There will be a lot less crashes and people dieing because of it.

The last thing that I would want to say is, lets thinks about all the little kids that are in the car and all the little kids getting hurt form being in a car where some stupid person hit the car and the kids get ether really hurt or even die. Just think about that for a litte bit. and Thinks about it when you drive today or when you start driveing. Dont be a stupid kid and race peopel and do bren outs and stuypid stuff like that. All you have to do is drive to one place to another.

That is really all I have too, want too, and need too say. About all of this. So if you ask me how I feel just remebre this essay. So yes i think we all need too get one of the driverless cars.

CC977017FB13,"Have you ever dream of a future where cars are driven by themselves? Well that dream will be coming faster than you think. With the advances in technology we are getting closer and closer in achieving a driveless car. Driveless cars could change the world so much. Thus it is a good idea that they should be made possible.

Driveless cars could help make the world better. We would no longer have to worry about how we would get to certain ares. All we would have to do is call in a driveless car, get in it, and it would take us to our destinantion. Another thing that make driveless car great is that it would use half the fuel of what we use today. It would also cause less accidents due to having sensors and thus alearting the driver when an accident might be possible.

These type of cars might be great but they have a lot of flaws. Some flaws are that they are not 100% driveless yet. They need the passanger to be on alert at all time so that when the soutition rises they can take over control. For example the article states,""notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigationg through work zones and around accidents."" Another thing to worry about is that who would be blame if the technology fails and someone is injuried or even killed? Would it be the driver or the manufacture that gets the blame? These are thing that we should be thinking about before we put this invention for sale.

All those flaws might give the wrong impression about driveless cars, but we can find a soulution to all these constraints. They might not be 100% driveless yet, but we are getting there. The advances in technology that we accomplish every day is growing rapidly. Every year we are creating and making our technology beter. For example, the article stats that.""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" Companies are also developing driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Another this is that the sensor might not be as good as we want today, but imagine how much better and advance they might be in about 5-10 years. Improvement in sensors, computer hardware, and software are making driving safer which is leading to driveless cars to be able to handle more and do more driving tasks on their own.

Currently we might have some contraints that are holding us back, but in time we will be able to get rid of them. With the improvements in our software and senors being made every day; we will be closer in achieving a 100% workable car. The advances in technology will help us create them and in time make them a realitiy. Driveless cars should be made. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

It can really do wonders to peoples lives in the future such as going out easier being safe and more efficient. But you still need a driver's license if you want to drive a smart car because when there is a something major going on the car can't sense what other people are going to do. I really think it can do good in the future with the more advance sensors on the cars and we may have better technology. I think it can do real good in this world like herlping people that can be hurt or in pain.

In paragraph 5 and 7 they have great detail of how it will help advance more in the future. In paragraph 7 they said,""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" They are not fully there yet on the selfless driving subject but they will be soon because in paragraph 5 has detail on that because it said,""Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect amd respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from thr sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a humman driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" It will be advanced in the future.

I really hope one day it will happen because we are damaging the plant by using the cars we are using now. It will damage the future for our children and future generations by doing what we are doing we need stop it because we don't want to have future generation clean up what we already can clean up now.

I'm against having the google car, because who needs a literally has laser beams that comes out of the top of the car to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

You should be the one in control of the car at all times. A person learns how to drive for a reason. They learn how to drive, so that their parents don't have to anymore, to maybe go places by yourself, and just to swee how well you have learned to drive and how much you have improved before you started to drive in the first place. Having a human drive you is better than a robot driving you because you have an advantage of learning and continuing how to learn how.

7BEB3F9FE21F,"In the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" the author states how our technology is increasing so much today, that soon we will see cars that drive themselves. The author states some negative sides to the story, and some positive. But I think that driverless cars will help our country in many different ways, and I support it.

According to the author, he says will we even be able to make new cars because there are laws that do not allow some states to test them. According to the article, ""As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars""(9). I think car manufacturers can test their cars in a factory in some states that it is legal to do it in, and once they prove that it is safe I believe that some states will uplift the laws that they have on self driving cars.

Also many people ask, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer""(9)? This is one of the main concerns of people today, but I would believe it would be the manufacturers fault since they were the ones who made the car, and designed all the parts of it. Humans should have no worry about liability for themselves because the car manufacturers should cover all the expenses that happened in the accident since they were the ones who designed the cars.

Another benifit to self driving cars is that they also would reduce half the fuel that humans use today. Accorting to the text it states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world""(1). Not using half the amount of fuel today is super benificial for the enviornment since we are not polluting it nearly as much. Many people would support this because we would be help save the enviornment, and also we would not have to spend nearly as much money on gas as we normally do. Another benift is how all the cars would be safe. According to BMW,""Safety is a big concern""(8). Clearly BMW would not release the car if it was not safe, but if our country all switches to self driving cars then this will reduce the crashes, and accidents by a ton, which would be saving many lives.

Many automakers are working on developing new safety gadgets for cars, and also a couple of the automakers have alrady developed a self driving car. Tesla for example, ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time""(10). Tesla has projected that they will release a car in 2016 that 90% of the time is on autopilot. That is this year, and when they release it all the other automakers are going to try and design a better self driving car than the tesla which could make the other manufacturers come out with a new self driving car soon also. Some other automakers have said, ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"" (10). This is crazy so by the time 2020 at least three more auto makers predict that they will have self driving cars also. By the 2020s we should expect my self drivin cars that will be on the road.

In conclusion there are many positives/ benifits that will come out of this self driving car. Though there are some set backs that some states/ automakers will have to over come. In the end outcome it will help drivers safety, and it will help the enviornment. In the overall outcome that is why we should have self driving automobiles.    ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

One reason why I am against the making of these cars are that the word ""driverless"" in the word driverless car, isn't true. The car is not one hundred percent driverless. The car will alert the driver when needed assistance. Such as heavy traffic, construction zones, and accident scenes. The narrator states, ""In fact, none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless."" As you can see, the car doesn't live up to it's name.

Another reason why I wouldn't approve driverless cars are that they aren't as safe to a human being in control of wheel. Technolgy is not that advanced to where it doesn't have glitches and issues. It still do. Not saying us humans don't, but wouldn't you rather be in control insteading of trusting a certain thing that is not one hundred percent accurate? Even traffic laws stated that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not what the claim to be. Their not guarnteed driverless and they aren't safe. From not even being real to their name to having issues. I hope I won't see a driverless car on the road anytime to see.    ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
097DBA99BCCA,"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This woman liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending her into a ditch. She liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this woman did get to her destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Phones don't have chords anymore. Americans don't send letters by mail as much as they used to. The citizens of this countru have been very efficient on many things. They have learned how to save time and money; furthermor, they have encorperated those ideas into everyday life. However, one item America doesn't need, due to limited safety; the time it takes for laws to pass; and the debt this country is in, is driverless cars.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

There are a lot of things that can go wrong. But on the other hand there is a lot that can go right. The sensors in the cars could allow the car to break long before the driver can react. These sensors can stop drivers from backing into things. the gps and 3D mapping could allow drivers to avoid crashes and avoid contrustion on roads. This would save drivers a lot of time. In closing I do believe that these cars are safe but to an ectend because they can not fully drive themselves.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
764FD24626F8,"Imagine a world with cars that can drive by themselves; how easy everything would be! Now imagine everything else that must come with this new technology; society would need new laws, economy would need more money, and what would happen to the people? How would the people change? How much would this new technology affect our already-dependent-on-technology society?

The public distribution of driverless cars would cause a large-scale reformation of many aspects of society. This would include not only the cars themselves, but also laws, roads, and the minds of the people. As explained in paragraph 9, laws would have to change to accomodate these driverless cars, and to ""cover liability in case of an accident."" The process of making new laws will forcefully change how people think about certain situations, such as insurance. The making of new roads might come about, also, because the option of smarter roads is open; the roads worked ""surprisingly well."" This will also change our society and the mind processing of individuals, as they will become less independent.

Another characteristic of people wit driverless cars that will change is their ability to stay alert and focused. In paragraph 8, the passage explains that one way to battle boredom for the passengers aboard the car is to provide entertainment and information systems that will automatically turn off if the need for custom navigation arises. However, although this is an innovative idea, suddenly turning off the systems will leave passengers confused and perhaps angry, and neither of these reactions will keep the possible driver alert and focused enough to get the car out of danger quickly. The systems will be distracting and will linger in the minds of the passengers, which can be unsafe when the driver must take control immediately after being interrupted from his favorite television show. If the car then crashes, we must ask why it would have happened, if the systems were supposedly so safe and foolproof.

Other questions we would have to ask ourselves concern the costs of introducing driverless cars into society. In paragraph one, Sergey Brin says that these cars would ""use half the fuel of today's taxis."" However, this decrease in expenses cannot combat the larger amount of sums due to several aspects. For example, building enough cars to release to the public would be quite costly; in paragraph 6, Sebastian Thrun says that some technology to build the driverless cars used to cost two hundred million dollars, and ""it wasn't something you could buy at Radio Shack."" The process of building these cars and getting them on the road could be very long and very expensive, throwing the United States into even greater debt. Another problem would be insurance. Paragraph 9 says, ""Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident...who is at fault -- the driver of the manufacturer?"" This event could lead to a court case, and buying more insurance to cover more needs: none of which comes at an easy price.

""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" This excerpt from paragraph 10 shows that automakers are merely assuming that they can surpass any obstacle and fix everything. However, we must consider what might happen if these problems can not be solved. The costs spent on creating these cars would have been for almost nothing, and society will have to reluctantly ease back into the ""old ways,"" disappointed, thinking about what they could have had. It will be better in the long run to prevent the completion of driverless cars at this moment in time, when society and economy are not quite ready for it yet. It is an easy future we must be prepared for, but also look forward to.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
41CDAAA96888,"I agree that driverless cars are good and should be used in the future. They would help out a lot in my eyes from when you are drunk or just tired and you fall asleep on the wheel. Or when you need to take care of a person while driving. Also when you lose your focus while driving those will help out just in case of an accident. Or when you are alone and you are hurt bad and you don't have enough energy to drive to the hospital. All those things are things that are neccessary and will need a smart car for.

For example, when you are coming home from a party and you have no one else to rely on to take you home a driverless car will be helpful in that situation. Or if you know you are going to fall asleep on the road after working a long shift all you would have to do is switch the autopilot on for your car. When a person is driving and they have a baby in the back seat and they need help with the baby then a driverless car would help while they take care of that baby. Or say if a husband's wife is pregnant in the passenger seat and they would be freaking out the whole time and they may lose focus on the road. The driverless car will help with all those situations so there will be no need for any worries. The companies run enough test to make sure the car is working right so you should be comfortable with the car. Plus no company wants to get sued for their car because it didn't do what they said it would do.

Some people daydream when they are driving and forget they are on the road driving and may get into an accident. Or teens like to text and drive (even though it is against the law to do that) the smart cars will help when a collision may happen. The General Motors company have a vibrating seat that alerts people when something is happening that they should watch out for. So whenever you are in a daze and you are coming close to hitting a tree the seat will vibrate hard enough for the driver to realize what they are doing. Even though the driverless car may need help sometimes trying to get through traffic jams and it would need your assitance, but the car is still worth getting considering that it can drive by itself 90% of the time.

When you are really hurt and it would be hard to drive yourself to the hospital all you would have to do is get enough energy to walk to your car and sit there until you to the hospital. No having to wait until your friends or family get to your house to take you to the hospital. Or what if you can't see at night while driving then you may need some help trying to get to wherever your destination is. Some elderly people have bad vision and they might have to work that night instead of leaving way early just have your smart car drive you there. Plus if you have a smart car death rates or even just accidents while driving will decrease a lot more than you can imagine.

Smart cars will be the new and good solution for a lot of things in the future and now. From driving tired and falling asleep on the wheel. Taking care of a person while driving. Losing focus on the road and not being able to see at night while trying to drive. Also having a emergency to the point when you can't drive youself. The smart car will solve all those problems for you and you won't have to worry about problems while driving again.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Can you imagine a world where we would no longer have to learn how to drive?

The roads today are more dangerous than ever.

People hardly pay attention now to the roads now, especially teenagers.

Everyone is on their phone while they are driving, either texting, calling, or social media.

These cars would be good for anyone, even the elderly.

Driverless cars would be safer than regular cars.

People may think that driverless cars would be bad beacuse drivers would pay less attention to the roads, but they are already not paying attention.

Driverless cars would cause less wrecks from texting and driving.

If we had driverless cars we would be able to eat in the car, maybe do makeup, and be able to call and text back without the treat of not paying attention.

It would be easier trying to find a destination in a driverless car because the driver would not have to do anything.

The car would turn all on its own and have the map already planned out.

If the driver was actually driving while trying to find a location, they may get lost.

It is complicated trying to drive and trying to listen to your phone or car give you directions.

But, if something were ever to occur and human assistance was needed, the car would notify the driver. Such as the drivers seat would vibrate if a dangerous obstruction were to come up, such as a traffic jam, an accident, and so on.

New technology and software is making this big change happen.

Driverless cars are coming into our society and we need to accept that they are the future and the next generation will be driving them.

Automobile manufatures, such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are already testing out this new technology and plan to have driverless cars by 2020.

Yes self-driving cars do decrease the risk of user error accidents but, as soon as the car tells you to grab the wheel because you need to drive the risk of those accidents go right back up. Yeah self-driving cars is a cool concept and, it would be nice to not have to drive all the time. With the thechnology we have now it wouldn't really be a self-driving car.

364FBA0A27EA,"Driverless cars are another one of the world's technological marvels, that not only take away the prevalent nuisance of driving for long periods of time, but in terms of safety and efficiency, prevail. When flexibility increases, prices decrease, and the safety of consumers is protected, then there is no reason that semi-autonomous cars should not replace the commercial vehicles that we see today.

One of the key issues that consumers have today in terms of purchasing a vehicle is the fuel consumption. Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google, provides evidence that suggests that these vehichles would use around half of the fuel that the vehicles today consume. Not only that, but Brin continues to state that the flexibility is increased as well, surpassing that of a bus.

Safety is also increased as a result of these vehicles. The fact that these vehicles are semi-autonomous and not completely autonomous enables a human driver to take control whenever they deem it necessary to do so. For example, Google's semi-autonomous creations are ""not truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways and when other complicated traffic issues arise.""

Sensors are what enable these vehicles to perform the tasks that astonish many to this day. Due to the fact that sensors have been used since the 1980s, vast improvements and tests have been conducted over the years to ensure that the safety of the consumer and those around he/she are preserved. The article even states that ""Within 10 years, those sensors [from the 1980s] had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" These vehicles allow for the potential decrease in drunk driving, which further emphasizes that safety is not only preserved with semi-autonomous cars, but is heavily increased.

There is a common misconception that by implementing the production of these vehicles, drivers will ""get bored of waiting for their turn to drive."" Although this is an issue that many psychologists are considering, some manufacturers are working to eliminate this issue. For example, the article suggests that there are a few car manufacturers that are hoping to rid of this anxiety by bringing in-car diplays and information systems that use heads-up displays. Not only is it a source of entertainment, but also an additional safety feature, which is also a major concern that is alleviated with semi-autonomous cars.

The fact that so many automobile companies, such as Tesla, BMW, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, are striving to integrate the idea of semi-autonomous vehicles into their production vehicles, provides even further assurance that the benefits undoubtedly outweigh the harms. Furthermore, this article explicitly states that, as a nation based on progression and safety, semi-autonomous vehicles are the means of achieving the road to a truly autonomous car, and a road to a dramatic increase in safety.

The advancements in technology and human understanding have come together to soon bring us the driverless car. The idea of a car without human assistance is ghostly, yet very interesting. I believe that human driven cars will soon be a thing of the past, and that the development of these new vehicles will be the new normal.

Vehicles without human drivers is the next big thing in society. Already, automakers have created cars that need human assistance when in dangerous situations. These vehicles will provide saftey, comfort, and cleanliness to a world that needs it. Everyone's main goal is to stay safe when they are on the road. With these new vehicles, no one will have to worry about all of the dangers presented today. The cars will brake, accelerate and drive wherever the driver desires. Without all of the stress of long trips, people will be able to rest and be alert for whatever is thrown their way. No one will have to intervene unless absolutely necessary. Many car companies and other organizations have decided to fund a driverless car. I beieve that it is the right thing to do, and that all will benefit from the experience. At some point, many will realize that computers are smarter than humans in many ways.

Because the negative outcome are far more than the positve outcomes over having driverless cars, I do not agree on the fact that we should use driverless cars in our everyday lifestyle.

One negative outcome of using driverless cars is how potentially dangerous these automatic vehicles could be.

New technologies are always risky because we do not always know what could malfunction.

Malfunctions of new technologies are very common.

I think there would be many vehicle malfunctions due to the technology that has not been allowed to test fully.

In this case, I do not think a new car is worth the risks that would proceed a technology malfunction.

Creating this new car could potentially risk many lives of the people riding in the car.

I do not believe risking the life a person would be worth a driverless car.

Another negative thing about driverless cars is how expensive creating the driverless cars would be.

The expense of these new and improved driverless vehicles would be ridiculously high.

In my opinion, I do not think such high amount of money would be worth having an automatic car.

I feel the current cars we drive are doing the job they need to do.

I think it would be a waste of money to make these driverless cars when we already have cars that do what they need to do.

Driverless cars may not be equipped for every possible occurence.

In the real world, you never are really prepared for what could happen.

I do not think it would be safe for the people in the car even if the driverless cars were set up to where the driver would take control during these situation.

Arguments have been shown as some say it is dangerous, and as others say it is a good thing. These cars are, i believe, a bad thing, becuase cars are not safe at all to be automatically driven by themsleves. A human, is the safest and most effective way possible, to drive a car, not driven by a computer created so it makes driving ""fun"" or ""safer"". In fact, this is a very dangerous act, that should not be invented.

Evidence and details from the passage, in paragraph 9, it states that ""most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."", and this is saying, that, basically, a computer, or automatic self controlled car is not safe to drive, and that the safest way to drive a car is to have an alert human behind the wheel driving. I highly agree with this, becuase driving a car is much more safer and effective towards pedestrians, passengers, the driver of the vehicle, and other drivers, unlike an automatic- computer self controlled car, which is not safe or effective at all, and it is actually very dangerous. It also says that the car will be able to detect when it is too close, going too fast, or is about to wreck . As stated in paragraph 7, it states that ""the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."", also, ""they can steeer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to noltify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."", etc....

Futuristic cars ARE NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. at all. simply, becuase, more accidents could occur, drivers are not contolling the car at all, it is all the computer controlling it, even though the car has cameras inside it, watching the driver, making sure they are focused on the road, paragraph 7. This is not only safe and somewhat dangerous in a wya, but is also creepy. Imagine you were inside a computer controlled car that has cameras inside watching you.

Based on the evidence and details from story, it is proven that these cars are both safe and dangerous to drive. So, should we drive these cars, or no? I believe the answer is no, myself. Because, yes these cars are somewhat safe to drive, but they are also very dangerous to drive as well.

Driverless cars can enhance the risk of accidents on the road and put other drivers on the road at risk for danger. Roads are already dangerous with human error that can lead to accidents, and sometimes death. By putting a car on the road that can drive by itself rise the danger rate. How can you insure safety for other drivers on the road? It reads in the text ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves"" cars are machines and machines have malfunctions, so how can you trust a machine to have control of your life?

However, driverless cars also rise the question of liability. Who is responable there is an accident involving a driverless car? Who should we blame the car or the driver? ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrains safe"" if this is true driverless cars have no liability. Driverless cars open a window to endless amounts of questions, all of which needs to be answered before they are on the road.

Lastly, driverless cars also can promote laziness. Technology is a beautiful thing to have but it can also make us lazy. Technology such as cellular phones have become a dependent for many people. So adding driverless cars to the list of technology that make us move and be active is dangerous. Car driven by people allow them to interact with their surroundings, but driverless cars take away a lot of that interaction.

The cars themsevles would cost a fortune to make but ""smart-roads systems""(3) would cost too much money for anyone person to pay. Now the car itself would be too much money because of the need of so many sensors. With an estimated guess, there would have to at least 11 different types of sensors to be place in one car. Even with thousands of dollars going into the driverless cars, they still have not found a way to have a completely driverless vehicle. Different cars call for different driver's assistance. Some ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel,""(7) while others will send a signal to the driver such as, vibrating the seat, announcing to driver that they ""should be prepared to take over""(7), and others have flashing lights. Which means that in no way is this car driverless if it some how requires the drivers help with driving.

These cars would cost one person, a lot of money that they do not have. Even the safe-road system that has not even been made would cost even more then the car itself. If that was not enough, then what about the fact that these cars are not driverless... the driver still needs to help driving. These reasonings just help with the understanding that these cars is just something that is not needed in this world.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
928B57062E9A,"Driveless cars to me is just anither innnovative ""American creation"" that will be brought into this worlds lives. Driveless cars are the new idea being brought into car manufactoring to possibly help and chane our world. The upmost new technology will be involed making the cars ""smart"", safe, easy to use, and ""fun"".

I believe it will be a great idea to continue this development, just for the wait to see how this being apart in humans lives would effect us. This will be the new thing and because of the change tat is coming to our world, know one knows the effects that could occur with the models being out and about in the world.

These models could possible create conflicts that should be handled before these activities are amongst the everyday human life. In the article, the author explains how laws are more towards the drivers and not the cars. Now with driveless cars, the decisions should be disscussed now on new lawmaking before they're out and about.

Other than saftey issues, I believe just as in the article, that driveless cars would be fascinating new idea and a change in the world that people would want to see weather its the new ""fun"" thing, or a fail that could use work.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

First how would these computers like programs know when to go or turn at a stop light? This could create many dangers and conflicts on the road. Next how could these computers detect humans? If the car doesn't know a person is j walking it could run over the person and possibly kill them, and yes j walking is illegal but it still happens. Finally i don't think these computers are a good idea because of malfunction. If something goes wrong in the car or the brakes go out it can lead to death for the passenger. I just think these vehicles are a little way to risky and not safe. In the article it says these cars need to be proven more safe. So this means these cars are not safe at the moment. As you can see i believe these cars are not safe and i am against it.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F8686B287824,"Have you ever been in a situation where you have very little to no control at all? How anxious were you in this situation? This feeling is something that we have all been through at least onces in our lives. Having known this feeling very well myself, I feel that having Driverless Cars would be a huge mistake. Having the ability to sit back and watch your car drives itself would lead to one being distracted more often because they would have more time to check a phone or send a text. Having independent cars could also result in more accidents that were the after effect of a computer malfunction. Another flaw that was stated in the passage dealt with the fact that if one crashes, there could be an endless fight of who is really liable, the driver or the manufacturer. Having the technology to make self dependent cars would lead to more time for distractions, a higher chances of malfunctions, and law sutis over liablity.

Having Driverless Cars would allow most of the population to have more time to get distracted. If a teen has just gotten a new tablet and wants to get it all set up and go some where at the same time, they would be able to do this. They would jump into their car and start messing with their new toy. If a little kid happens to run into the road while the driver isn't paying attention, the car probably wouldn't have time to react. Now the driver has to deal with a man slaughter charge just becuase the car was supposed to do it for her. The situtation is also a perfect example of how these cars could malfunction.

Another flaw to the new concept of self driving cars is the fact that they could suffer computer malfunctions at any time. If the driver needs to drive through a dirt road, the car could hit a bump that would knock a wire lose that controls the speed of the vehicle. The car could also get rain water into on of the control panels that migh end of leaving one stranced on the side of the road due to an electrical fire. Another computer flaw is that nothing is perfect. Not every single computer hard drive or control panel is going to be exactly right.

One little mistake by the developer could lead to an entire city worth of cars having to be recalled. At this point if a driver is in a recalled vehicle and gets into an accident, who is there really to blame?

The final reason to keep independent cars just a dream is the fact that there is no way to tell who is really liable for the accident. If a civilian is driving through a street in the city while another is on a bike and they hit at a intersection with numerous blind spots, who is going to take the blame. Will the pedestrian on the bike be charged because he wasn't aware of the unknown blind spot? Will the civilian in the car be charged with unvoluntary man slaughter because he/she expected the car to stop, or will the manufacturer be charged because their flawless design lead to the death of a innocent citizen? There are so many reasons to just leave this unlikely vision in the minds of the creators: however, these three are really the things that companies need to pay attention to.

The way that people can get distracted so easily, the way that computers can malfunction, and the way that people will try to put the blame on others are three reasons why companies need to leave independent cars in a dream. People should never have to worry about a car with a mind of its own killing innocent people. The entire idea of Driverless Cars is completely filled with flaws that could lead to infinite problems in the driving world. Driverless cars should not be part of our future or any one else's after that. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
108C4D1E4C79,"When you go out in the streets have you ever seen a driverless car? Are you safe with letting your children in the streets knowing there is a car with no need of a driver to drive it? well , i dont argue with driverless cars. Why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver?

One of the reasons for not agreeing with the driverless car is safety. Safety is a big part the world and specially in the streets. There really is no need for driverless cars because in the paragragh it says "" In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless "" The human driver must remain alert an be ready to take over when the situation requires. If its a driverless car we dont need to pay attention because it would be driving on it own. Yet, the car still needs our help in situations it can't do it self.

Also, it says in the paragraph "" Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert driver."" So, when driving a driverless car you dont have to steer, accelerate, and brake. But you have to still pay attention. Driverless cars should not be allowed in the streets, An malfunction can happen at any second on the road an whos to blame? The driver or the driverless car? ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge,"" admits Dr. Werner HUber, a BMW project manager driver. Theres always gonna be a challenge but we dont need more of a challenge when something isnt working in our driverless car.

Lastly, Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Which mean driverless cars are not safe, i mean not all cars are safe but really think about it , would you want you child out in the streets knowing the law is letting driverless car drive around? Because i know my children wouldnt be out. As a result , in most states it is illegal even to tesr computer driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault?

My conclusion is that driverless cars should not be allowed on the streets because of safety reasons , and failures on streets. Nobody knows when, where, and at what time an accident can happen due to driverless cars. All cars always needs to be driven by a human not a computer. Laws are made for human drivers not computers.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
038FE8A0EE82,"Many people believe that the production of driverless cars isn't the best. I'm going to inform you as to why I believe that driverless cars are the best for our near future. Google cofounder Sergey Brin has done a series of tests to prove that driverless vehicles are not a danger to the public but can be very usefull. Not only are the good right now, but they are also improving little by little every day.

For starters, by having driverless cars, we will be able to decrease the amount of accidents that we have. This will happen by having no one at fault but the technology, and I know that sounds like I'm going against it, but I'm not. Not only does the car have special features that make it stop when it's too close to an object but if that fails then who's to blame? Right now we have drivers who are falling asleep at the wheel due to being tired, coming home from work late, and/or going out to parties. Driverless cars will help with this. They have a special feature in the car where if the car feels that the person needs to take over, they will vibrate the seat and even flash the windsheld, (although they're working on the windsheld) this will help keep the driver awake and reduce the amount of accidents we have.

Having driverless cars will also help decrease the amount of air polution we have due to factories and the amount of cars that polute the air.

It says in the passage that ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" By Sergey stating this, he's saying that we would reduce the amount of air polution. Not only is it reducing the amount of air polution but it's also far more comfortable than a bus.

Driverless cars will be an increasing business once it's not illegal in every state. This will happen because who wouldn't want a driverless car? This business will sky rocket due to the amount of people who would want a driverless car. This comes back to helping the economy. By having people buy driverless cars, this will drastically help the economy.

Many people don't like to be supervised while driving, but having a driverless car, this is a special feature. Not only will it help the driver back out of drive ways, or parking lots, but it will also help identify who was at fault if there were ever an accident. It also helps with no texting and driving, because the car will not allow it. Once the car feels that it needs the drivers attention towards the road, the seat will vibrate calling the attention of the driver to take over the wheel. Therefore the driver will not be able to text and drive. Not only is this benefical for drivers, it's also helpful for new drivers. Because they are not experienced they are more likely to be in an accident. Which is why the driver may need this feature while driving.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless vehicles are better for the environment because the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. Not only will it help the environment it will help the economy. Therefore it will become an increasing production. This is only the beginning of something great. It's improving everyday and will continue to improve.  ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FC995D1D61C9,"The concept of a driverless car seems very interesting and even mind-blowing. There could be many ways that the world could benefit from the development of these cars, but thinking deeper into it, these cars could also be quite a problem. Technology is not always the most reliable source. Having a self-driving car based on technology will not always be reliable either. Sometimes, things malfunction, and if these cars are self-driving becasue of technology, these cars will most likely malfunction as well. Therefore, I do not support the manufacturing of driverless cars.

Regardless of still being able to take control of the car, drivers may still find it hazzardly to be sitting in a piece of metal and technology and just rely on that to get them where they want to be. If the car malfunctions, and the person inside the car gets injured, it would not be their fault, nor the other people driving on the road with them. Most likely, it would the be the manufacturer's fault because of faulty design or poor assembly. Example of a malfuntion of these cars could include simply losing its directions. Sitting in a car that has no idea where it is going could be scary. Though the driver could take control if need be, this would still be concering if the driver was not paying attention, and therefore arriving at a place they did not want to visit. Even if the car could be perfected, there is always the thought of bad weather and icy roads, or roadblocks and accidents. Again, taking control could be an easy solution, though one not might have the time to do so.

Driverless cars still would need a lot of work. They would need to be tested over and over again, even if nothing is wrong with the car to enusre safety. It would have to be tested in different weather conditions and different roads with accidents and roadblocks on them to test the feature of letting the driver take back control of the car. There very well could be fewer accidents with these cars, but problems can come with solutions. While self-driving cars is a wonderous idea, I believe there are still too many risks. Today's technology is getting to the point where it is very possible, but technology will always be technology; there will always be some kinks that need to be fixed.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
2D33AA475F14,"Driverless cars are the future of safety while driving across the world. These cars have the technology to predict and protect against complex life-threatening issues that a human does not possess the power to handle themselves. Although the change to semi-driverless or driverless cars may be expensive; it is a change that can change the future of driving on roads for the better.

An issue that comes with having fully human controlled vehicles is not all cars have safety measures that the driver can control, such as sensors in the brakes. These sensors contain information that the human driving could not possess alone, showing that we need driverless cars to help make the upcoming generation of drivers more protected on the dangerous roads. In paragraph five the author states: ""antilock brakes can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone,"" which shows the true power of these sensors inside of driverless cars. Legalizing driverless cars can bring the power of antilock brakes to every car in the world which would drastically reduce the amount of accidents related to skidding on ice or flipping cars.

One of the reasons that these driverless cars are not legalized in all states is as of right now traffic laws are under the assumption that ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times,"" as the author states in paragraph nine. Although these cars are not driven by humans one hundred percent of the time, they can still be taken over by humans whenever a situation such as an accident in the middle of the road needs to be navigated around, this is proven in the seventh paragraph. In paragraph seven the author says: ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate whenever a vehicle is in danger of backing into an object,"" and ""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over,"" proving that when the driver is in danger, the driver can take over the controls. These innovations heighten the safety of the driver in one of these vehicles.

Driverless cars and sensors aren't anything new to the roads, either. In paragraph three the author states that General Motors has been working on driverless cars since the late 1950s. As technology rapidly advances the sensors and computer needed to make driverless cars can become less expensive and more powerful. In only ten years advancements such as antilock brakes and the ability to drive seventy-five percent of the time have surfaced, and there are many more advancements to come. The first generation of driverless cars are expected throughout 2016-2020, with many more generations and advancements to improve upon the original models.

In 1980, the dream of having a fully autonomous vehicle would be something to see in a science-fiction magazine. Little did the people know that these cars would be available in only 36-40 years away and could dramatically increase safety on roads. Driverless cars provide heightened safety for the next generations of drivers and should not be taken as something small. Now that the technology is here to stay we need to be able to put it to proper use. Driverless cars have many generations to come and more safety to benefit the future generation of drivers.

BCC1433ECAEB,"Accourding to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it says that even though it's ""driverless"" its not completely driverless. So what is even the point of having a so called ""driverless"" car if its not completely driverless. I would think if someone was going to go spend money on what I assuming to be is a very expensive car, that they bought for it specific reason so they do not have to drive for any cicumstances.

If Google were to start selling these so called ""driverless"" cars, and something were to happen would it be the person in the car's fault or the cars? Honestly I feel like this would be a huge conflict if they were to become public. For example if someone got into an accident would it be there fault not paying attention in the ""driverless"" car. If Google is going to say they have a ""driverless"" car I think they should make it completely driverless, so itcould be worth your money and prevent accidents.

""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead accuires human skill, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" That is the part that is scary about these cars would if it has a malfunction and doesn""t notify the driver? Would if the car is a reason for one of those accidents? How long will they work until they give up and just stop working? What happens if they stop working and the driver has no control over the car? See there are so many possiblilities that makes these cars so unsafe.

Cars opperated by us are unsafe now as it is, imagine something without a brain driving a car. Why do we need ""driverless"" cars around? From what I have experinced while driving, it teaches you responsiblitly, and it teaches you to be aware of your surroundings. If you make a car that you don""t have to drive then doesn't that just defet the whole purpose of driving? Without human opperation on cars we would have people in this world who would rely on everthing else on this Earth to do things for them.

We dont need computer opperated cars to drive for us when we can just do the work ourselves. Like I said before it teaches us responsiblitly, and without responsiblitly what would this world become? We would become duds. I understand that a manual driven car is technology, but it provides us disipline, and self awareness. Do you think that a ""driveless"" car could provide that for us?

Yet they are not truly driverless, they still alert the driver to take over in certain conditions , for example pulling in and out of drive ways or driving through road work or accidents.

These smart road systems worked well but require massive upgrades to existiing roads , which is simply too expensive.

532C1A46BF8F,"I think that the smart cars would be really cool to have. I think if we have these car some people, like me, may actually want to drive. Some people have a fear of driving, and I think these cars could be a good way to help with that fear. I have this fear because of the car accident in my family.

Another note that would have it be more helpful is help older people to drive. My great grandma never learned how to drive. If these cars were here just maybe it could help her get out of the house more. Many people think that if you get in a car accident, while the smart car is driving the manufacturer should be punished. I don't think this because you still have to stay alert when something is coming up. One other thing I can think of is that the car is not fully driverless. This to some people is a downfall, but to me I think it is awesome. The shows that we are getting lazier by the day. The author states, ""... but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires the human skills, such as navigating through work zones and accident... the humn driver must remain alert and be ready to take over."" This to me is a major downfall to the car. Driver should still be resposible for any damage that is done to another person or other car. If you are going to drive make sure you focus on the road head and leave the phone alone till you get to your destination or home.

Even as we go about our daily lives people somewhere are working to make that happen. With driverless cars we can spend more time with our family. The driverless car will no doubt help lessen the accidents caused by cars, it will also allow you to do something more important than driving on your way to and from work, and it will help keep your children under control because of you being able to talk to them about their actions in the backseat of your car.

Automated driving will help stop accidents from happening. Driverless cars are safer because they use sensors rather than the human attention span. Also driverless cars have an automatic brake system in a child or car got in front of the car at any time the car would be able to stop before collision. The cars will also allow everything to be more electronically inclined. If we get automated cars it will change how we live and our productivity.

While driving a car you have to pay a lot of attention to any hazards that may come along, and you don't have any time to work on the project for your workplace. While you are driving you could have been working on said project, but you couldn't due to the fact that you had to pay attention to the road. If we develope automated cars it will help bring work productivity up and sales along with it. The economy could really get a boost from them. Which would help people get jobs and more people would come out of poverty. Which could help us pay more attention to the future generation.

What are your kids doing half the day do you know? Do you drive with your kids in the car? How many life lessons could you have taught them if you didn't have to drive? I am guessing a lot. Your kids want to hear your stories and they want to know that they are loved by you. If you can't take five minutes out of your day to talk to them what kind of life will they lead.

My point is that with automated cars we will get more done, have more time to talk to our kids, and we will get into less accidents due to inattention. We could have a life like that.

2C283B3AD1F5,"While reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I'll admit that the idea of a driverless car was cool, but it concerns me about our upcoming future. As I got to the end of the reading my thoughts were more near the negtive side than the positive side. I mean the world today is and always will be coming up with newer things, but I personally feel that we are taking, ""The sky is our only limit,"" a little too far.

In the artical, Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver admits,"" We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" Today almost everywhere you go, you happen to hear about people texting and driving, which produces the trama of an innocent life being taken away because of some little thing that distracts a majority of us today. How are we supposed to introduce this ""fun new way of driving"", when there are people who aren't even responsible to drive on the road the right way? Some may say, ""Well that's another good reason for driverless cars!"", but in reality, it's not.

Also a question that is stated in the artical is,""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacture?"" that question right there is also a major scare to a lot of us in society. On a day to day basis, we are dealing with wars in third world countries, people dying because of hunger, a new disease that can wipe out any country, and so many more things that an everyday individual doesn't even know about or think about. Introducing a driverless car, will only add to that stress and drama. Most people would say that it's another bad idea that car manucturers have pitched.

Finally I'd like to say, It may sound like I'm bashing this entire idea, but really I'm just thinking about it realistically. Another statement that supports my argument is that television and movies have long been fascinated with the cars that could drive themselves. Another projection that many could inturprut the wrong way, especially new drivers. Teens today see crazy things done in movies and/or television shows and go and say,""Well if that actor can do it, so can I!"" If they see a driverless car, who knows what's going to happen.

In conclusion, driverless cars aren't the best idea. Throughout the entire artical there are roadblocks and warning signs that show, diverless cars are simpily a pleasure and not a neccesity. Therefore the idea of driverless cars isn't so great.               ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
0FA5C20D0027,"Driverless cars are coming thats no good! Since 2009 google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. Thier cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless. The Google cars still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

In my opion driverless cars are pretty dangerous and stupid. I think that becasue drivers would try to play on their phone more and do other things that will not make them keep their eyes on the road or their surroundings. Just because the cars are ""driverless"" doesn't mean they cant mess up or have a glitch when they are driving and when they are playing on their phones. Having driverless cars is a huge mistakes they will put peoples life at risk and so many people when end up wrecking and dieing because they are more worried about their mobile devices.

My second reason I think ""driverless"" cars are stupid is becasue people will not pay attention to their surrounding. People will pay attention to the things that are inside the car and not the things outside the car like other cars around them or even other object around them. People driving the car will be more focoused on the radio or all the cool features that come with the car like the new bluetooth radio or the new settting on the radio. The new cars will have so many new featrues that people will not even realize they are on the road.

My last reason I think the cars are stupid is becasue what are people gonna do when the car breaks or glitches up. The first batch of cars will have issues just like the first batch of everything that is new. The car could glitch up at any moment when the car is in motion and some one is in it. What are people gonna do when they are driving and the car just stops driving itself and runs off the road into oncoming traffic or runs off a mountain. What are the people gonna do when their family memebrs die because of the cars glitching up and killing their brother,sister, or cousin. The first thing they are going to do is blame the company and sue them for everything they have.

That is why I think ""driverless"" cars are stupid and dangerous. People will not pay attention they will car more about their phone. People will not pay attention to their surrounding they will pay attention to things inside the car. And the cars have a high chance of glitching up and killing the driver or maybe another person in the street or on the sidewalk.

4E0024CDAE47,"Should driverless cars be legalized throughout the United States? I argue that they shouldn't. First of all, driving is an important skill to have and without that skill, an individual becomes less independent. Secondly, if we, as a country, relied on driverless cars to transport us places, we would rely on other technology to help us live too, thus losing more independence. Lastly, if driverless cars were to malfunction, then humans wouldn't have the option to drive a real car around. These are just three reasons I believe driverless cars shouldn't become a part of our society. Firstly I will explain, in more detail, my first reason; driving is an important skill to have and without that skill, an individual becomes less independent.

My first reason for why driverless cars shouldn't become part of our society is that driving is an important skill to have and without that skill, an individual becomes less independent. There are many skills to have in life: dealing with money, performing your job to the best of your ability, and striking up a conversation with somebody. Among those skills is driving. When a person drives themself somewhere, they are showing that they are independent. If driverless cars were to be set into motion in our society, then how would our country look? How would a father supporting a family look if he went from driving himself to having a car drive for him?

My second reason that driverless cars don't belong in our society is that if we, as a country, relied on driverless cars to transport us places, we would rely on other technology to help us live too, thus losing more independence. Americans already rely on technology to help us with our everyday lives. We rely on phones, computers, and even televisions to entertain us. If the skill of driving were taken away from people altogether, then we would most likely turn to other technology to help us, like hoveround chairs so we don't have to walk, or completely turn to computers and forget writing altogether. My third reason that driverless cars shouldn't be replacing cars in America is that if driverless cars were to malfunction, then humans wouldn't have the option to drive a real car around.

In the future, if driverless cars were to start malfunctioning, after forty to fifty years after they had succeeded gasoline cars, then there would only be a minority of people that would know how to drive and the majority of the country would have to learn how to drive again. That is, if the government would agree to build gasoline cars again.

The proposed question was: ""Should driverless cars replace gasoline cars?"" I argue that driverless cars should not replace gasoline cars. My first reason is that driving is an important skill to have and without that skill, an individual becomes less independent. My second reason is that if we, as a country, relied on driverless cars to transport us places, we would rely on other technology to help us live too, thus losing more independence.

Nowadays, people are already frustrated by having to drive the car themselves but if you throw in a driverless car in to the mix? That is not safe for the people inside and/or outside the car. As the passage states, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" Also, what if the car is in ""driverless mode"" and begins to glitch, what is going to happen then? Or, the aftermath of a car accident and someone gets hurt, who is to blame then?

Usually, when people in their adolescence get a car they are thrilled because it is their responsibility to drive that car safely and to be independent. However, with buying a driverless car, all the independence and responsibilty just flies away. In the future, what is going to happen when people feel that way since the car is driving, they do not have to do anything behind the wheel. Or, if someone falls asleep and does not hear, see, or feel the warnings and signals from the car to take control, For example, when the driver's seat starts to vibrate or the flashing lights on the windshield.

A car that is driverless is quite impressive, but then what is the point of having a human behind the wheel. People who are for the development of these types of cars do not get the whole idea behind the problem with these cars. The passage states, ""-the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Big whoop, throughout the years a human's attention spand has sky rocketed downwards. So, even if there was a warning, there would not be a big chance if the driver even saw or heard it.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars enforces independece, not safe, and is not fully developed to be driving without a human behind the wheel. If we stop this development now, we can stop the risks of what is yet to come in the future on the road.    ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
D378BBBEB080,"Driverless Cars is a great idea, these cars would make a huge change in the world because these cars would be really helpful, but there are some adventages and disavenges of the use of these cars, one adventages is that can drive by themselves, but a desaventage is that if the sensors don't work what would happen?.

Driverless cars would be really helpful for people and mostly for people that travel a lot they fall sleep, these cars would help them by taking control and so no one get hurt. Driverless cars have sensors that help to create a 3-D model of the car's surroundings so this would help the car to see if there is any danger and if the is the car will notify the driver to take over and take another options. Cars like these ones are a great idea, it will allow the drivers to take a rest when they are tired.

Cars like driverless cars are not perfect and they are not 100 percent safe, these cars can be really expensive too and not everyone would buy them. About safety the sensors that these cars use what if they don't work? what would it happen? if the sensors don't work the cars will not alert the driver if there is any danger and this will end up in an accident and would not be good for the manufacturer and the owner, these were some reasons why the manufacturers want to put cameras in the cars so the car can see the driver and know whether the driver can drive or cannot drive.

Some manufacturers like GM they have developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Other car that tells the driver when they should take over the car is the Google car. Cameras in cars can help a lot because while the driver is watching the road the car is watching the driver. Some manufacturers are considering bringing entertainment for these cars and information system that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off when the driver needs to take over. This new tegnology in cars is really good, but how much these will cost? No one knows yet. I strongly agree with the develop of the driverless cars because this will really help peole and will help to reduce the cars accidents.

Driverless cars are defenitly are great this new tegnology will allow the driver to take a rest and then take over any time. The sensors that the cars have help to avoid any danger. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have these new cars drive themselves by 2020, the cars they try to make will be the best option to have less cars accidents in the future.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
0B52B1F1265B,"I believe that the negative aspects of driverless cars outweigh the positive ones. There are too many complications and problems that are yet to be solved. Driverless cars are a very unique and interesting invention, but I am not in favor of the development of these cars. There is a vast number of improvements that still need to be made in order for these cars to function properly.

Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error.

I also am against driverless cars because there is a lack of safety when a driver is not in control of a car. Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars.

Lastly, driverless cars are not fully capable of running independently. With this, you would need to figure out an effective way to alert your driver when their assistance is needed. If the driver could not be alerted, then this could lead to massive consequences. In paragraph 7 it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This quote highlights the neccesity of getting the driver's attention. If in any case the driver was not able to be alerted, the repercussions would be severe.

In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
2B0B79F6E0C3,"There has been a huge argument about driverless cars on whether to make them and actually continue with it or not. According to the article ""Driverless cars are coming"", ideas involving driverless cars have been thought of since the 1950s, but the cars have not been fully completed. For that reason, driverless cars should not continue to be developed. Having a car that does the same things you could kind of defeats the purpose of you being in the car at all, there is no point. The cars can be extremely dangerous. If you want to be safe, that means giving up things you might think you want.

Driverless cars should not continue being developed because there really is no point in have a car that can do all of the things you are able to do. It is said that driverless cars can operate fully on their own until certain times require otherwise, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" (paragraph 7). These cars can basically be categorized as kind of useless. Why have a car that will basically only drive straight until needing to turn? If there is ever a real driverless car created, it should meet all of the basic requirement such as knowing how to turn properly.

Another reason why driverless cars should no longer be created is because they could go horribly wrong while someone is driving. While driving, the driver will want to be able to rely on a car that will take them where they need to go. Driverless cars could be deemed unable to do this. While someone is driving, they do not want their car to break down nor do they want it to explode or anything like the other new devices coming out. There are others also agree, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states ist is illegal even to test computer-driven cars"" (paragraph 9). Some states believe that by putting customers in the seats of these cars, they are putting them in serious danger. This is why some states have these driverlsess cars banned and illegal. If possible and badly wanted, everyone should follow along.

Driverless cars might seem very nice until serious things end up happening. They might allow the driver to take a break from driving, let the driver relax and see things without just driving for a long period of time, but they will not guarantee ones safety. If safety is wanted by everyone then driverless cars should be given up on. Also, maybe people actually like driving, they would not want to give up the amazing opprotunity of driving to a computer when they can do it themselves. Driverless cars should wait to be given to the public until fully complete.      ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BC2AB1466CE0,"Welcome to 2016. Finally, technolgy had gotten smarter and smarter. Even smarter than some humans these days. We have finally come up with a way to make our lives even more easier. Yay! Driverless cars is a brilliant, genius idea. Having a driverless car helps better our environment, safety, and could even save you some extra money.

Pollution and global warming is a big problem. Our Earth is dying. With over population in many countries having cars that run on gas impacts our enviroment. All the fuel tha that is used is killing Earth day by day. Now, think about this. Having a car that runs on only half the fuel you would typically use? Sounds good right? Using only half the fuel we would typically use would make a tremendous differnece in our environment in a matter of a year.

Having a vehicle is a privlage. It can also be very dangerous. In the news we always here about that one person or that group of teenagers getting into a car with a driver under the influence. Then we know what happens next. When you are under the influence you do not know you are,therfore, you think you are fine to do anything especially driving. Having a driverless car may actually saves lives. If one is out drinking or doing things they should not be and decide they have to drive, that car might just save them from the unexpected.

Lastly, lets talk money. We all want to save money and buy more toys. Maybe you even want to go on a vacation to some nice beach where it is warm. How are you going to do that when you get a nice $1000 dollar spending ticket in a construction zone on I-65? Driverless vehicles maintain speed limit and know driving regulations. You may want to be going faster but your car is going to save you from getting that ticket.

Better environment, protection of human safety, and money saving is something all like to hear. This new driverless car is all that within one vehicle. Purchasing a car can be difficult. You want the best for you money. Having a car that helps the enviornment, protects you, and saves you money is the car you should be interested in. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
DE05DCB75D79,"Driverless cars is the way the automotive industry is heading, and will be here sooner than people think. Many big names that specialize in different aspects of technology are working on driverless cars. Some of the biggest are Google, BMW, and Tesla. People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and in the 1950s GM tried ""smart roads"" as a solution, but was soon disregarded because of the cost.

Almost all the successful driverless cars have been producted by big successful companies that are household names. Google is highly respected and is working on a driverless cars, and in total those cars have driven more than half a million miles. In those half a million miles not a single crash has happened. BMW is also helping solve problems with driverless cars by intoducing ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This new technology requires the driver to have their hands on the wheel as the car drives itself in case the person is needed to take over. Also Toyota has helped set the templet for Google's smart car by producing the Toyota Prius.

The knowledge of how to design a smart car has been around for a long time, but the technology is just now letting us build our dream car. Improvments on technology and cheaper technology makes it easier to build a smart car. An example of technology that has under gone this transformation are all the different sensors in cars. This technology is also making cars safe like an antilock break.

People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and the human race is known for making dreams into realality. For a long time driverless cars have only been seen in television shows and movies, but now big name companies are working hard to solve the probelms that face smart cars to make it come true. This dream is nothing new, and was first tested in 1950s by GM.

Driverless cars are not to far away in the future and will help make our lives safer.

6F5B58C28A2D,"A world full of driverless cars seems a thousand years away; the thought of being able go anywhere at anytime without driving or a driver seems to be science fiction. However, with recent advancements in the field of driverless automoblies, this fantasy can exist sooner than one might think. With the Google Car program and BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" the world of driverless cars may almost be here. I believe that development and research for the creation of truly automatic transportation should be continued, based on information from ""Driverless Cars Are Coming:"" the invention of driverless cars, the safety implications and solutions, and the options for making driving a better experience.

Completely driverless cars continue to be science fiction, but with advancements in technology, the dream of driverless cars is within reach. But the obstacles of driverless cars are not as simple as just inventing one. Right now, driverless cars exist, such as Google's modified Toyota Prius. With a multitude of different sensors, including a rotating radar on the roof, this car can mimic the skill of a human. These developments have revolutionized the field of driverless cars; with the Google Car project, it is possible to have a driverless car today. But there is still room for improvement, such as safety and the driving experience, which is why development of these driverless cars should continue.

The issue of the safety of automoblies is still relevant to driverless cars as well. If there is a situation that the driverless car cannot handle, there could be accidents and damage. However, driverless car developers continue to address this problem, and solutions have been proposed. BMW has announced that they have developed a car that can drive itself for speed up to 25 mph. They also require that the driver keep attention to the wheel, and will notify if there is a situation where the driver must take over. This allows the driver to navigate work zones or around accidents, increasing the safety of the driverless car. The car can alert the driver in several ways, so the driver can always know when it is necessary to drive. With more development, the cars can be better prepared to handle situations and know when to notify the driver, increasing the safety of the experience.

With the invention of the driverless car, the driving experience can change in new ways. The aspect of driving a driverless car allows the driving fun to be interpreted in diferent ways. This especcially proves true for in-car entertainment options. With cars that can notifty the driver whenever there is a situation to take over, the driver can relax and use in-car entertainment and information systems safely. These increase the driving experience and what the driver or passangers can do, without endangering people or property. As more development is made, the driving experience can change to make driving better for all; a time to relax or have fun, while maintaining safety.

With so many advancements in driverless cars, a world run by driverless cars is a possibility. The invention of driverless cars, safety solotions, and an increase in the driving experience all show that with development and research, truly driverless cars can be achieved. I believe that development on driverless cars should continue, so that they can be perfected and put into use, making driving better for everyone.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

That could all change because by the year 2020 a lot of the big car companies such as Mercedes, nissan etc are planning to maek Driverless vehicles. The invention of driverless cars can be a good or bad thing it depends on the way you look at it.

Driverless cars are coming with a lot of new technology such as cameras to see if the driver is focused on the road, on the windshield there will be heads-up displays, the car would use half of todays fuel, and more flexibility then a bus. Some cons of driverless cars can be the price of such technology in a vehicle, the price for companys to manifacture the car, and always if the technology fails and someone gets injured, hurt, or dies on the road who would we blame for the incident? Who is justice served to the driver or the manufacturer?

In conclusion I think they should not create a truly Driverless car there are many cons that come along it and the biggest and most important i believe is going to be the price of the vehicle. A car with a driver is a lot more safer then we know if a incident happens we know who was responcible and why and how it occured.

Yes it would be nice to have a taxi service that doesn't have a driver, but what about the people who drove those cars for a living, they would be put out of buisness.

When making a new car safety is key, in order to make such a car you have to be sure that everything is optimal for consumors to buy. If one car goes malfuntioning that would be bad for the company. Although the idea defeats the point of the driverless car. When people are stuck in traffic they don't want to sit there behind the wheel moving inch by inch, but the car cannot drive in such conditions as close traffic, consrtuction, sites or around accidents, Which is one of the reasons people want the auto driving car so they don't have to sit through that.

So to me driverless cars need more improvement in safety and manuverbility, or they're not going to get many sales on this product, and if it is produced many people will complain and probably end up with lawsuits and refunds.

On the other hand though if this idea was a possibility with more safety with no driver needed at all then any company that perfects the production first will be very rich indeed.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Another thing would be cars with out people needing to drive on the drivers seat. such as like getting in a taxi, you just tell the car where you would like to go and where its locatced at just like you would to the man in the taxi. exept this time you dont have to pay your car for the distance it drove you just like you would pay a taxi man/woman.

This car would have to be like a ohone in order to drive its self but more technalgy put into it , because it has to have sencers so it will not hit another car that it is in front, side or behind you. and also it will need to have a very very advanced gps that will be have to be updated everytime there would be traffic, road blocks, road floding, construction on the road that is getting fixed, where all the new reaturants that have been just barley been built and open for service. This car need so much things installed to it for it will need to be perfect but not also is it just the car that will probably need to have things installed to it, also we would need to install chips on the stop lights. so there for the car can know when the light is on green to go, yellow to slow down for a stop, and red to atomaticlly stop. it would need to signal the car and give it a message letting it know what color the stop light know so there for it would give the car time to react to what it is instructed to do.

I was thinking, what if we had to install sincers on to or into the road so there for the car will not go off road and it will know what lane it has to stay on or take. then also guss what ? we would have to also maybe install sincers to the speed limit sign to where it will notificate the car how fast it should be going on the road or how fast it should be turnning on a certain road.

Know you see all the stuff we will need to do in order for people to have a car that will drive itself? this will cost a lot of money ! i mean a lot ! because you would have to bulid all of that and install all of that to the whole untied states ! thats a lot of money just for a car that drives itself. its cool but i mean this will only make people lazy to not drive at all.

EBD070DAE867,"As technology continues to advance, cars are seeing advancements in safety and driving capabilities that go further than what the driver can do. Cars the can sense when the car needs to break if the driver is distracted. Brakes that are anti-lock which means they distribute different amounts of braking pressure to wheels that may have more traction to prevent loss of control. All of these things are very good for cars and keeping drivers safe but are we close to seeing the ""Driverless Car""?

Cars have features now that can help or completely park themselves with the use of sensors. Many helpful gadgets that may help if human error occurs and can even prevent collisions. But then you have to also consider if this technology were to fail or have glitches that could be very dangerous. We can not know how these ""smart cars"" will age and how we can update the technology in them.

It is definitely possible to create a self-driving car. Many different organizations have succesfully done it but on closed tracks. These tracks do not have the real world complications that can arise such as road work or accidents that cause the car to go on alternate paths because the original one is blocked. This is when the human must take over and redirect the car.

Although there is this talk of a car that can drive without a human, we have not seen a car that is reliable and safe enough to be trusted without the driver being ready to take over when needed. If the driver has to sit at ready all the time then how is it a driverless car? As a driver, I know what I am capable of and I feel best when I am driving and I am in control. It would take a whole lot of trust for me to just turn my car on autopilot and let it take over considering there are many things that can happen while you are driving down the road. Many questions come up, such as, Will the car react in time? Will the technology even know to react? Will the car safely and controllably avoid whatever obsticle is thrown it's way. All these things change if the driver is sitting back not driving because the car apparently can do it all by itself.

Eventually, in the future, it is very possible to see cars with an autopilot function or other self-driving techniques but we are a long way from cars driving without human help. Laws in all but four states make it illegal to use a car that drives itself because, ""lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers"" (Paragraph 9). So it is obvious that we have a ways to go from a legal standpoint until you will see cars driving themselves on these American roads. This set aside, the advancements in technology is doing wonderful things in the safety category. Cars can avoid collisions or alert drivers if they make mistakes like going over the center double yellow lines. This helps prevent the awful head on collision of two cars. In conclusion, we are not terribly far from cars driving themselves. It is more a safety and trust concern rather than the technology being there. Cars will drive themselves more and more but with the aid of the driver always being there and capable of taking over at any time. But does this make them self-driving if the driver must be present and paying attention at all times? Why not keep their attention by just letting the driver, you know, DRIVE?

73A5A2871074,"Should new technology be shut down before it has a chance to prove itself? Then the driverless cars should be developed and permited for use on public roads. As common technology improves and computers get smarter, sensors get more accurate, and technology becomes more reliable, the driverless cars stand more of a chance against the roads of today. BMW already has a driving assistant that can drive at low speeds like in traffic jams. However, most cars are never completely driverless and still require a skilled driver to take over when the going gets tough. But soon enough will they be ready to use anytime, anywhere.

The current technology, used to make driverless cars a possibility, is good enough for easy going roads and still rely on a driver to take overat times. In the passage it states, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"". This points out that as time goes by and things move along in sensors for safety, things in the driverless catagory are getting more accurate to prevent mishaps. Driverless cars are also helped out by the fact that they can get to the point of being able to drive far more accuratly that any human driver, but it may take some time for technology to reach this level of accuracy.

Semi-driverless cars are a thing that can just be in the backround to aid drivers in situations and provide them with a way to get away from the stress of traffic, making them better drivers. In the passage it states, ""In 2013, BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant.' The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph"". This show that some car big car makers are transitioning to driverless or semi-driverless cars very soon. Large automakers like BMW have a huge reputation that they need to live up to. They wouldn't risk that on something that could cause many issues later on.

Most lawmakers are against the use of driverless cars on public roads because of a safety concerns, but the developers have said that anything that exists today are still not entirely drivereless and cannot handle most things that apear in driving. In the passage is says, ""...but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues"". This means that things are not perfect and still require a driver behind the wheel. If everything worked perfect, the driverless cars would be the best drivers on the roads today due to their inceaced accuracy and speed at which they can make decisions.

Driverless cars should be allowed to operate on public roadways. The technology behind them, once perfected, will provide the safest cars avaliable today by avoiding the crashes.

BE6A7B809487,"Drivelesss cars should not continue to develop. There are many reason for it,and three of the could be that it can still cause problems on the road even though it been developed fully. Even though its been fully developed not everyone is okay with it. The driveless cars can also take away the experiance way from a young adult wanting to drive their own car. These are only some reasons driveless cars should not be developed even more.

One reason is that driveless cars can be a problem on the road because yet being fully develop there is a possiblity something could go wrong with it. On the road anything is possible and it will come when least expected. Maybe with all this developing in it it can cause a greater damage then a regualar car would. In the article they talk about who's fault it would be if something would go wrong with it. The people driving it should not have to take the fault for because they didn't make. Yet they would only by it because of what the manufatures say about they will try persuading the people to by it.

Another reason is that not every state is okay with this because they might know the damage these driveless cars are capable of doing. With not every state okay with it, the manufactures could have a less chances of selling much of thses cars. In the article they only talk about four places that have considerer the driveless. They would also have to have new laws in order to over they rules of the driveless cars.

A third reason is that driveless cars would take way learning expireances from young adaults that would actually like to drive their own car. In the article paragraph eight they say ""We have to interpret the drivnig fun in a new way.""This is like say you can as well stay home and do nothing. When you drive you can learn many things like road signs and road name without even knowing it. Something they also talk about is about driveless cars bieng safe because peole will be able to text on their cell phones while driving. This is not okay maybe the only way some poeple can stay off their phones is when they are driving and they are trying to take that way. People can as well just stay home and be on their phones all the time and text all the time. This car would probably just make people more lazy.

I think that driving is a lot of fun and if we take away peoples ability to drive then we will miss out on a lot of fun and skills that can help in everyday life. Automatic cars are not safe, if there is an accident on the road or constuction or anything blocking the road then the automatic cars will need the assistance of human drivers. The cars that are being produced now are not even fully automatic.

There are some car manufactoring companies that have already made cars that are almost driverless and have been working on making driverless cars for years and years. Some of these companies include General Motors, google (using a Toyota Prius), BMW, Tesla, Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan have all either come out with a car that is almost driverless or has released plans to release them, Tesla in 2016 and the others in 2020. These manufacturing companies have already started making automatic cars and have been working on them for a very long time. I think that if the companies keep working and progressing on the safety issues with the automatic vehicles then maybe these automatic cars can be a good thing.

I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all of out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our contry that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth any more effors than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufactorers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered.

When I get in my car and just drive, it is always fun. The feeling of being free and being able to go wherever you want and just to be able to drive is amazing. I think that many people love to drive and if we made automatic cars the manual cars would start to dissappear. Making many people upset and many others miss out of the wonders of driving. Diving a car can help build and develop many skills that can be helpful in every day life and even at work. Driving can help you develop your reflexes and your ability to spot details and be somewhat predictive of what others might do. That can help with plenty of jobs including sports. Learning to drive a car is one of the memories that you will remeber forever. If we have automatic cars then we will miss out on those memories.

Automatic cars will not be safe. These automatic cars can not handle anything besides normal road conditions or even pulling in and out of driveways. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" (Driverless cars are coming, author unknown). These cars have been built to alert the driver when they need to take over the vehicle, but are still not capable of functioning without a human driver, which could be a safety hazards. If the vehicle is not able to handle the road conditions ahead it will attemp to notify the driver inside, but considering it is an automatic vehicle the driver may have fallen asleep due to the lack of entertainment of activities to keep them alert and then the car nor the driver is able to manuver the obsticles ahead and the could cause an accident resluting in the death of anyone involved.

Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic.

6B6AA45692D5,"Should driverless cars be allowed.?They should not be allowed because you can get really hurt, More time on repair,More accidents. These reasons support why I think that driverless cars should not be allowed. Should driverless cars be allowed, No because you can get really hurt. that topic supports why i think driverless cars should not be allowed because if you cant control what is going on then how do you think that you can avoid accidents or say someone is not paying attention and they pull out in front of you and you cant just slam on the breaks you have to wait for a sensor to be tricked so that way your car will stop this will lead to more accidents and or more deaths. This reason supports why i think that driverless cars should not be allowed. Furhter, driverless cars should not be allowed becuse they will cost more to repair. I say that because say you are driving down the road and something in the engine goes out and it causes you to be on the side of the road stranded. your gonna have to pay for a tow truck. also when you go in to get the car cheecked out and the part that blew out was something that they dont have in stores so you have to get it shipped which is already taking two to three business days to get here so your gonna be with out a car until then so your gonna have to rent a car which costs a fourtion,or the part that you need is brand new so its gonna be really expensive. Then you have to pay for someone to put the part in for you because since this is a driverless car and the techonology is new your not gonna know what goes were. these reason support why i think driverless cars should not be allowed. Lastly, do you think driverless cars should be allowed?. No, because there will be more accidents. I say that because a driverless car means that the person in the driver seat can not control the car in any way. so if you get to going fast and then your mom or dad calls or textes you and you have to look down and then when you look down a car cuts you off and gets in your lane then causes you to flip your car and or die. These reason support why i think that driverless cars should not be alowed. In conclusion, do you think that driverless cars should be allowed. no, I say that because you could get reallly hurt, cost more money to repair,and more accidents these reasons support why i think that driverless cars should not be allowed.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
00885C23A764,"The idea of having cars that can do the driving for us is something we are getting close to. The stresses and dangers of driving could be eradicated by not controling a car. At this point we are not quite there; cars are not driverless and may cause more harm than good in situation that sensors can not yet deal with. Human control is important and relaxing too much can cause problems with that. Not having to think about driving and instead just enjoying the ride is something that most desire, but the safety of these vehicals has to be taken into consideration.

Driving can be a stressful part of one's day and eliminating the need to pay such close attention and relax is what most people want. Right now, driving involves paying close attention to everything around a car and features within the car as well. All of this can be stressful and hectic and the ability to mess up and cause damage to ones own self, someone else, or to property becomes too easy. Smart cars not only get rid of the stresses of driving, but include safety features that could do better that a human. Sensors are the main factor of making these cars work and have safety features that can, ""..apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage."" At this point smart cars still involve a human element with drivers still having to take over in difficult situations. To get drivers attention many ideas have come about. Some such as the in-car entertainment system even allow for leisure and then turn off when a driver when they need to take over. All of these features sound nice, but is it really that much safer?

The cars that have been developed and even the ones proposed for the near future are not completly driverless. That means that drivers have to stay alert. There are systems to alert a driver, but if a driver is relaxed the transition could be difficult. It would not be a completly stress free ride if a driver has to think about when they will have to take over and in what difficult situation that would be in, because drivers are expected to take over in difficult situations. ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways of dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork of accidents."" When learning to drive we may reach a point that what is primarily being taught is the dificult things and when the computer stops working one would just have to get off the road or drive dangorously. Or we could reach the point that teaching people how to drive stops. Once we reach the point of not needing a human driver people become completly at the mercy of a computer and we lose the ability to drive because we don't need to know how. Computers can always malfunction and then it's not even a human at fault when people die because of it. Driving teaches control, awareness, and even patience, if a computer is doing all that those life skills are not readily learned and lost to more people. These factors do not sound any better to me.

I think we should have smart cars, but with the right percautions and keeping an element of human control. Sensors giving warnings and keeping drivers alert should be enough to help with the safety concerns. Stress is reduced in this situation because a driver has the help of the sensors, but is not relient upon it either. The systems that allow entertainment are too controled by a computer and cause issues with transitioning between relaxing and paying attention to driving. Driving still has to be taught and if a computer dosen't work humans still have the knowledge to take over without extra danger.

Having humans do more of the controling, but having safety features sounds like the best thing to me. It still reduces stress because sensors are used as early warning systems and features keeping one alert. Skills that go along with driving are not lost and a driver doesn't get too relaxed. Drivers are not completely relient upon a device that could malfunction, but the help is not gone. The idea of doing nothing sounds nice, but I just don't think it is the safest option.

Can you imagine the time that you get into to your car and the only thing you have to do is say car start. Well that where are cars are tranforming into we are starting to get cars that we don't have to drive the cars drive for us.

Driverless cars well also help the driver. In the text it say's "" they still alert driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork accidents."" So the driverless car well also let the driver know when to take over maunally by vibration of the seat. So the driver well always have to be aware of whats going on. driverless cars well also get you to where you're going in the shortest amount of time possible.

I think if we have self driving cars there wont be as many car crashes as there have been in the past couple of years. From people texting and driving or driving drunk or stuff like that. In paragragh 7 the text says'' They can steer ,accelerate , and brake themselves."" So if the drivers are careless and not paying attiention to the road like there text or something the care can stop for them and not cause a crash.

Thats why i agree with the idea of a driverless car. I can see why some people wouldn't want a driverless car because what if the car crashes or something went wrong with it you might be the one responsible for the car crashing. So i can see why they might not want a driverless car. I think that driverless cars well be a good thing to have in 2020           ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4AACE1A55911,"My opinion is that Driverless cars should not be driven on the roads because one they eventually crash after they have been driven a certain amount of miles. These cars are not even truly driverless, forexample uu have to pull them in and out of driveways take over when the car is in traffic. The driverless car is truly useless because the roads arent fit for this car unless they have have the special message Binary code, The binary code allows the car to drive on the road.

Some more reasons to why i think the car should not be driven is because the car still needs a driver. The car is illegal in most states such as, California, Nevada, Florida, And the district of Columbia. They are illegal in these staes because they are not reliably safe. In the passage it says still, even if traffic laws change new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer.?

This car is not safe to pedestrians because if the car were to loose to control and the person in the car isnt able to take control quick enough then the pedestrian and the car owner would be hurt. Alas this car should not be driven because it needs too much work done on it such as, better sensors more magnetic sensors.

Inconclusin these cars should not be driven because they are dangerous and can harm somebody. They do not have all the materials this car need and they cant really be driven driverless because of all the malunfunctions which would stop people from buying the car because if they found out that the car has as many problems as it does they arent gonna want it which keeps them from recievimg money.

08DB3C4C4C3D,"Driverless cars would be a great thing for the future but there are also negatives to it. It would also be a lot of money spent to make this invention possible. If you think about it cars are pretty much driverless in a way because some cars can parallel park on their own, and evenstop themselves when it senses an oncoming vehicle that is to close.

The negative effect that this would have on the world is that these cars could possibly malfunction and lead to a wreck. It would let a drivers guard down to a very low level and they wouldn't be focused on the road as much as they would if they were the ones actually driving. This could also take away the law that drivers have to have a liscense in order to drive because some will think ""who needs a liscense to drive a driverless vehicle""?. That issue alone could lead to many problems. I believe that vehicles are only safe when a human is controlling it.

The positive effect that driverless cars could have on the world is that it could create many jobs for people. It could help people get places that they aren't familiar with.

My opinion on this is that vehicles should only be driven by a human that is liscensed to operate a vehicle. I don't think people will be safe if driverless cars became a thing because the creators wouldn't be 100% sure that these vehicles are safe to be on the road. Lives could possibly be at risk.

954486CDA6EA,"You wake up one morning and you think about how when you first learned how to drive, you actually had to drive by yourself. There wasn't anyone or anything doing it for you. Times have changed and now you have something to help you drive, a driverless car. Sounds so futuristic, like something you saw in a cartoon when you were younger, right? Well, as you can tell from the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", driverless cars are going to become a thing regardless of what you think. It might not be soon, but it is coming one day. They might make a huge impact to where every family has a driverless car or a small impact to where only the rich can afford it.

I do think that driverless cars are something that might take over the whole world one day, and it might not be a horrible thing. Driverless cars are more of a safty percaution in the way it is set up, rather than just you sitting in a car not paying attention. You will still have control over the car, but you do not have to be in control the whole time. That is what I think is so great about them, you don't have to worry about not having control of the car. The sensors in the car can detect when danger might occur, and when that happens, the car starts to warn the driver. All though, there are still many bugs and flaws with the cars, they oviously need to get more into the laws and liabilties and how that will all work out.

Overall, I just really think that even if driverless cars aren't that big of a hit, it would be sort of like symbol to represent the time peirod of inovation and creation. Just thinking about how far technology is going really blows my mind. I would have never thought to belive that cars like this would be on the market in my lifetime. That is just so crazy. The times have clearly changed. I just cannot wrap my head around the idea, epecially when I can remember a time when casset players where still in cars.

18F8E6C69F5E,"Cars that can drive themselves have been a fantasy for many years. They have been seen in movies and shows for quite a while, and many have hopes that someday, it will become a reality. With recent research and new developments, car manufacturers are beginning to actually make driverless cars possible. Altough there are many risks that could take place in the us of driverless cars, I believe that driverless cars should be made and used for everyone in the future.

A driverless car would have dozens of benefits for drivers on the road. Because there would be sensors all around the car that monitor the car's surroundings at all times, there would be almost no crashes. As of now, there are already cars that can drive by themselves, however, if there is a obstacle on the road, it will alert the driver and allow him to take over. When car manufacturers can develop a way for these cars to detect obstacles and manuver around them, the road will a much safer place, and car crashes would almost become nonexistent. When everyone has a driverless car, there would not even be chance to have a crash, unless nature gets involved, since each car is on a course that is monitoring the road at all times. Not only would there be fewer car crashes due to collisions, but there would also be no more speeding or reckless driving from unresponsible or inexperienced drivers.

Two of the main causes of car crashes today is the act of texting while driving and drinking while driving. If the car drives itself, then there would be no more distracted drivers that don't have their eyes on the road. A driverless car would allow the person in the drivers seat to focus on other things. When they develop cars that won't need a driver under circumstances, the person in the car may become bored, due to the lack of the thrill while driving. To solve this issue, these driverless cars would have in-car entertainment that would allow the owner of the car to not become bored. Another big benifit of driverless cars would be that they would use half the amount of gas and therefor not only saving the earth's limited amount of gas, but also saving people tons of money.

As stated, I strongly believe that they use of driverless cars should become a reality in the future and that everyone should use them. This would further increase everyones safety on the road and lead to fewer injuries and crimes. Not only would driverless cars benefit others by helping them achieve their destination safely, but also by saving the earth's amount of gas and saving people's money.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
D82CB7B7EC22,"I don't think that the idea of a driverless car is a good idea. I feel as if driverless cars are just the fact of people being lazy. I don't understand what's hard about driving a car just for a short amount of time. Driverless cars might be a good idea for long road trips, but just think about how much work those cars would need if they broke down.

On the positive side these driverless car might be a good idea for someone that's always is on the go & they get tired of driving. It may also be good for the mothers of young children. Only when the child is crying the can have the car driving it's self while they get the baby in order. They should really make that a feature of the car. Other than that the car seems worthless & is just another car problem that us Americans would have.

Then we have the negative & I could go on & on about this one. Now having a driverless is just insane & lazy. First off what is the point of having a car if it's just going to drive it's self? I think it would cause more accident & like the article said; who's fault would it be the would the accident be on? Then insurance would be at an all time high, because the makers of these cars are going to find everyway to make these more advanced then the next, like I said in the first paragraph how much EXACTLY would it cost to buy A car like this or even fix a car like this ? Literally us as people only make enough to support our families & pay the bill. Having to buy these cars would be another thing to break us.

To wrap things up, in my opinion i think this car is something that they should second guess. It might benefit some people & others it might put a steep hole in their pocket.

39EEA4D67175,"Driverless cars look like they will be used on the roads in the very near future. I am for the idea of driverless cars because i believe they are safe and are capable of more than just driving people around.

I believe driverless cars are more safe than actual cars that are driven today. These driverless cars have the capability of something more than just driving on their own. Driverless cars make sure the driver is paying attention to the wheel at all times, as stated in paragraph seven. In paragraph seven it is said that none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. This means that the cars can ""steer, acclerate, and brake themselves, but are all designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"". It is also stated that manufacturers are considering installing cameras that watch the drivers to make sure they are remained focused on the road. The statement ""while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver"" means if the driver were to fall asleep, the car would alarm the driver that they are in danger and they need to pull over to rest.

I think that driverless cars seem safe, and maybe even safer than cars on the road today. Sensors are very important in these cars and thats what will make them so safe. The technology being used in the cars are important as they will help the car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Information of the sensors can cause the car to brake or reduce power from the engine. This passage states many times that the cars are being made to alert drivers when going through tough situations such as accidents or roadwork on the roads ahead. A manufacturer ""has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object"", which will also help the driver to be aware of their surroundings and will reduce accidents.

These new technologies are definitely going to be beneficial in acting as a human would drive or to keep the driver alert. I believe driverless cars are a very good idea in order to keep people safe on the roads. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
347D66EC79EA,"All of our lives, many people have talked about how there would be flying cars in the future.

You see it in countless movies and shows, the most popular probably being Back to the Future.

Unfortanatly, the flying car is yet to be made. However, many companies are working on driverless cars. Cars that you can just get in and they will drive you where ever you need.

As amazing and unbeleiveable as this idea sounds, is it worth the risks?

To be able to make a safe car that runs on its own seems very difficult.

It is not something that can be made overnight.

In fact, Google has made and is still working on driverless cars since 2009.

So, this idea has been around for long enough, but why do we not see any driverless cars on the road today?

No company can seem to make a car smart enough to drive itself.

BMW annouced 3 years ago the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car can drive in speeds up to 25 miles per hour, althought the ""not-so-driver"" must keep his or her hands on the wheel, and they are alerted when they must take over driving. Meaning that they must pay atttention at all times.

So what is the point of these so called ""driverless"" cars if they are not completley ""driverless""?

This idea can totally change the world. Although, should their really be driverless cars on the roads if they are not COMPLETELY self-driven?

Maybe not.

What if someone isn't paying attention to the road then suddenly the car is put in a situation where it doesn't know what to do, forcing the ""driver"" to spring into action.

This could be deadly.

Plus, what if people forget how to properly drive after years of a car doing for them? Then when they do need to take over the driving, their driving skills may be rusty, and they defininatly won't know what to do in an advanced situation, such as if the car was skidding and/or going off the road.

Leading to many injurys or even death.

With that being said there are still many injurys and deaths with people opperating cars.

So you may say that the argument is invalid.

Although, you can teach humans to be carful in a car, and yes we make mistakes, but humans, unlike computers, can adapt to complicated situations.

Driverless cars seem very helpful, but is it really worth the risk of death.

Would you really put you saftey into the hands of a computer?

F578E6663650,"Can you imagine life much less at risk? Well, unforunately there is a new way to prevent danger when it comes to driving on roads or even highways. Companies now are developing new ways in which they can make driving more safe then what it is now. For example, companies are making computer-driving cars. These cars have sensors to prevent any harm or danger when it comes to driving.

Firstly, my positon on driverless cars is that are they really safe to the new society? Only, because what if something goes wrong with the car, you are not able to control that but then again you could be blamed for something you had no control over of, the fact that these cars are driverless but your still behind the wheel. It says that the combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. It's also proven that further improvements in sensors and compuuter hardware and even software to make driving safer are also leading cars that can handle more and more tasks on their own. Driverless cars are not fully 100% ready for the new world only because it lets us know that these cars plan to have driven themselves by 2020, this is related to Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan.

In addition, what if the technology fail on its behalf and someone gets injured, who is at fault, the manufacture or the driver? It tells us that automakers are still continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved and thought throughly. This is something to think about because the fact that these cars are not original, they are opperated by computers there isn't a guarntee that these cars are the safetest, because this is a big concern. If something tends to go wrong I strongly believe the driver should take over and opperate the car themselves. Malfunction can occur to the device and instantly turn off or shut down so that's when it is best for the driver to always pay attention and make sure that they are in the right safety care.

Last but not least, drivers must stay on task and focused. Manufactures are also considering using cameras to watch the that drivers are remaining focused on the roads. Did you know while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver? Only for safety reasons through. I highly doubt these companies would want a bad reputation on the line for the driverless cars.

In conclusion, I do believe you can imagine life less at risk by the help of these cars. I think that these cars would play a big helping part in modern times as well. We still time to think out the process of these cars and how they would properly function.
