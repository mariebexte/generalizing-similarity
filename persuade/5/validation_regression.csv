CD92E1021C51,"Driverless cars could change the world. If we had cars that could do the driving for us, we could avoid wrecks and traffic jams. Googles driverless cars have drove over half a million miles without a single crash! Having driverless cabs would be amazing, especially if they took up less gas.

If we didnt have to worry about things like wrecks and traffic jams, life in cities could become much easier. Driving would become much more effecient if we didnt have to worry about human error. We could get to places much faster and safer.

The driverless cab idea would be amazing if we had the technology to do that. We need to be able to make driverless cars safer before being able to legalize them in the states. I'm sure in time that we will reach the technology. Once they are completely safe then there will be no reason for it to be illegal.

Being able to notify a driver in a sticky situation would be helpful as well. They could help us be more aware of our surroundings. Maybe they could even see blindspots.

Overall I think that driverless cars would be very usefull to us. It would make driving much safer, especially in crowded roads like cities. It could even make getting to places faster. Being able to see blindspots when driving could also help avoid many wrecks.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.2
8C8CABBB478E,"Based on what I have read o do not think self riving cars should be allowed. The law is right based on what they say these cars eventhough they have sensos to make the driver aware of situations in need of a human. The person in the car may become to focused on what they are doing and ignore the sensor. The idea of self driven cars is too risky. Even though they are going for safety a car cant drive like a human or have the response time of a human and even computers make mistakes.

Even in a simple GPS they tend to make mistakes often. So what happens if the cars GPS is off on its calculations and the car drives through a house. Will they blame that on the driver. I would hope not. It shouldnt be the drivers mistake if the car messes up. You cant always rely on computers.

So no I highly disagree with this. Computers arent perfect, and there are just some things only humans can do. Driving might just be one of those things. What these people are visualizing are just things they have seen on t. v that does not mean it will happen the same as it does on t. v.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
9817FA650D61,"In my opinion I think driverless cars are a bad idea. I think they are inconvinent. I believe that bad things could happen if there were driverless cars, such as accidents and or death itself. Lastly, I believe that malfunctions can and will happen in driverlss cars. In this essay I will explain why I think driverless cars are a bad idea for more then one reason.

To start off with, driverless cars are not completely driverless as of right now. Therefore they are very in convinent because they cannot go through work sites or traffic areas, where most people wouldn't want to drive through. Details taken from the passage are ""...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alret the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents.""

In my experience I find driving through work cites to be a little scary because you have to maintain a slow speed and make sure you do not hit anything or injure anyone. With workers on the road it makes it scary as well because accidents can happen, but you never want them to occur. In my opinion this is a huge inconvience for people who get nervous driving through these areas.

Secondly, I believe that bad things could occur from driverless cars, such as malfunctions causing a car to maybe stop working with you inside it would possibly the car losing control of itself and you being injure because of this. They have driverless cars right now that are not completely driverless and you have to drive for certain parts of the road, but what if this dosn't work and the car continues to drive through a work cite with a speed limit of 20 mph going a speed of 50 mph? Someone would end up getting hurt and you would end up with a big fine or jail time. Taken from the text itself, ""...new laws willbe needed in order to cover liability in the case of an ccident. I fhte technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This means that if something bad happens no one knows who wil be blamed.

Next, cars can malfunction adn there have been recalls in the past because of things that have gone wrong. For example brakes not working causing a death toll. What car brand wants someone to look at their cars and then see a death toll due to the fact that the car companies brakes didn't do their job and a person couldn't stop? Driverless cars have many sensors. AS started from the text, ""For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."" Sensors and almost anything else can malfunction for no reason at all. Because of how many sensors would be in a completely driverless car there is no way to insure that every sensor will work properly and make sure no mistakes will be made.

Some people may say that times are changing and technology is at an all time high and they would be correct, however I do not believe that driverless cars are the future. I believe that they are dangerous and could do more harm then good. That is why in my opinion driverless cars are a bad idea for more then one reason. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6
885170E312C1,"Driverless cars will be a great innovation in the automobile insustry, because driverless cars will be safer, more convenient, and possibly more fuel efficient.

Driverless cars would make the world a lot safer, when dealing with automobiles. People die everyday in car accidents. With driverless cars, at first, of course, there will be complications regarding the sensing and accident prevention. After so long, with yearly upgrades and constant innovation, driverless cars' software should excel to the point of perfection, without any accident occurance. In paragraph 5, the test states, ""Sensors are nothing new, of course. in the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" This example shows that sensoring software ability is increasing, and as time goes by technologists learn more and more. Over time sensors will get better and better to the point where driverless cars are 100% safe.

Driverless cars are more convenient than cars with drivers. Cars with drivers require full attention from the driver. There are many cases, involving possibly injury, or even just fatigue, where a driver is forced into a position of either finding alternate transportation, or driving under dangerous circumstances. If a driver owns a driverless car, or has the accessability to a driverless ""taxi"", then whether fatigue, injured, or intoxicated, the driver, or now passenger, can safely be transported to their destination, without the result of an accident. Many people against the idea of driverless cars would claim that a driver must still be alert with a driverless car. This statement would be true, as of now, but if driverless cars are introduced now, within the next ten years, driverless cars will be so dominantly present, drivers would never have to touch the wheel. If every car on a street is computer controlled, the computer systems could recognize another attempting to leave a parking lot and simply leave the car space to do so. Through more innovations, obstacles like those stated in paragraph 7, would be easily manuvered.

Driverless cars are more fuel efficient than cars with drivers. Many times today, people drive their cars with a ""heavy foot."" Acceleration uses gas in a car that could be saved with coasting. If are car is ran by a computer, acceleration and coasting time would be monitored, and done the most efficiently possible. In paragraph 1, the text states, ""The cars [Google cofounder Sergey Brin] forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis..."" This example shows that, driverless taxis and cars are far more fuel efficient. If a driverless car owner uses only half the fuel of a driver required car owner, then the driverless car owner is saving a tremendously more amount of money on fuel.

Driverless cars will be a great innovation in the automobile insustry, because driverless cars will be safer, more convenient, and possibly more fuel efficient. ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8
4CC7E2AC5542,"Driverless cars have more cons and disadvantages then they do pros and advantages. The author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" presents positive and negative aspects of driverless cars but I really only see the negatives. If there are driverless cars, then there could be a lot more crashes then there already are. Driverless cars are pointless and show a great amount of negatives, show that no one in the car will be paying attention, and there are so many safety issues.

First, there are many negatives regarding driverless cars. Technology in the future may be able to have cars without a driver at all. In the article though, the author states that currently they would not be truly driverless yet. The driver would still need to stay alert and be able to take over when needed, like driving through a work zone or when they are driving through an accident site. When a person is driving a car, they already need to be fully alert and know what is happening around them at all times to stay safe. If we have someone sitting in the drivers seat waiting to have to take control, then what is the point of not driving it when you pretty much need to continue to know what is going on at all times? There is always the fear that something will go wrong and the car just will not work right. This could cause serious injuries and even death to the driver and passengers in the driverless car as well as other cars and people around them. Another issue is that there is a lot of poverty and familes without enough money to buy a regular car. The amount of technology and work needed to make these driverless cars will put The United States of America in even more debt then they already are. As well as many other countries around the world. The cost for these driverless cars are a huge negative that will result in many people not being able to afford to buy them.

Secondly, when the car is driving without a driver but still has a driver in the drivers seat, the driver could be on their phone, reading something, or listening to music and not paying attention then all the sudden the car alerts them that they need to take over but they are not ready and do not know the reason why they are in the situation to take over the car. This could cause crashes and serious injuries to the driver and other passengers in their car, as well as people in cars around them. Nobody can promise that the driver will be able to pay attention at all times when the car is driving itself. It is kind of like having someone in the passenger seat, they are not driving so they are on their phones, reading stuff, and listening to music, not paying attention to the road. Same goes for a driver just sitting in the drivers seat and not driving the car. They could be not paying attention and then all the sudden they are surprised with the need to start driving in a situation they have not been paying attention to. In paragraph eight of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author expresses that they are trying to bring up in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-ups displays. The author states that this could be a safety feature, but who knows that will work perfectly, or that the driver will be entertained by that?

Lastly, the safety issues regarding the driverless cars could be an endless list. If the driver is not paying attention, like I expressed in the pervious paragraph, the issues with safety grow bigger then they already are with actual people driving cars. If the driver has no clue what is going on because they were on their phones, reading something, or listening to music and then suddenly they have to take over, this could cause a crash that could cause serious and minor injuries as well as death. The amount of crashes that happen today with actual humans driving cars are already through the roof, if something messes up with the driverless car, it could be very bad. It is just like how your phone can mess up randomly and stop working, what if that happens to the driverless car?

The author of the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" expresses both postive and negative aspects of driverlesscars. I believe that driverless cars have more negatives than positives and are pointless. They also show many safety issues that can put many people in danger and show financial disadvantages. In conclusion, driverless cars should not be a thing in order to keep everybody safe.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6
0BAE98DD2CC4,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" discusses the idea of regular automobiles and automobiles that are able to be controlled remotely by themselves. It states that companies such as Google have had self driven automobiles since 2009 and have continued to work on them. The arguements stands on which of the two are better for the overall socitey. From my standpoint I believe that regular automobiles from today's day and age are the best for everyone. I belive that self driven automobiles are much more of a safe choice to go with out of the two.

We have come so far as humans to go from developing forks and knives to cars that can drive themselves. I believe this is a big accomplishment in mankind but I also belive that it's not practical and safe to do so. Cars driven by themselves will cause so many issues for drivng if they were ever brought on to roads and streets. So many things would have to be adjusted in order for the veichles to be able to be on public roads and highways. Driverless cars would change everything we know about the automobile and it's inner workings.

Laws would be changed immensely and in a multitude of different ways. Mechanics would be of no use to us driverless cars. They would have to learn go back to school and learn a whole new way to operate on these cars. Many glitches could happen within these cars and end up causing accidents and many fatalities to drivers.

Driverless cars are not way to go in terms of veichles. Cars driven by people is the only way we can keep control of what's going on within the highway and on the road itself. Driverless cars would cause more deaths and injuries within automobile accidents. We must stay with cars driven by people.      ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
111D45750F1E,"I'm against having driverless cars because I don't think that driverless cars will ever work properly without getting into a wreck on its own. The cars wouldn't even be driverless because it would have to have a person turn them into and out of a driveway or dealing with complicated issues dealing with traffic. You're not just assisting a car you are driving the car still. It isn't 100% on its own on the road you would still have to help steer at certain spots. Therefore they can't be trusted because you could be approaching a stoplight that has a lot of traffic and then your car wouldn't stop you would have to stop it before it caused a wreck.

I would feel much more safe if I had just a regular, normal car that I could drive 100% of the time. The only safe car is a car that has a person in it and driving it. If it was a choice between the driver or the manufacturer I would definately say that it was the manufacturer because a good driver wouldn't wreck, or get injured. The car would though because a self driving car couldn't work and would cause way more wrecks than what there are now. Therefore I would never let a self driving car drive me around.

Like I said it wouldn't even be 100% on its own just the driving straight part of it. The car wouldn't be able to turn or go into traffic on its own, but a person can. That's why I'm against Driverless Cars and why I don't think that any of them would work.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.2
FCA127E9B41A,"I would not suguest self-driving cars. What if war ever comes and the enemy were to somehow hack the cars and kill people who are in them. Everyone would require a car upgrade and some people wont be able to afford that. Im good with a 2005 Monte Carlo. Now what they should do is bring classic cars back and start making parts for them again.

In my honest oppinion I believe 1969 was the golden years for cars. I wouldn't want a car that has a camera that watches me while I drive. Thats like too far over the line. I can understand if they made flying cars in the future that uses magnetic power or even fuel of some sort. I honestly believe that we are going to keep creating better and better technology.

Eventually technology is going to be smarter than humanity and it will over run the human race and make us the lowest life force. People need to think for future preferences. Driveless cars would also be a bad idea because some older people don't get technology too well and they could get seriously hurt if they don't opperate the car right. Some people wouldn't want to have a camera in a car that watches them because they may go park somewhere and want to do something private and it wouldn't be private with a camera above their head. Plus people would start to get lazy and not want to drive at all.

Then we may have another obeasity problem. There are just too many concerns and unanswered questions to have self driving cars. I trust a human driver a lot more than an electrical driver any day. I wouldn't want to drive a car thats smarter than me. Theres no telling what could happen with these cars.

Yes they may have been tested and everything but the outcome may vary with different cars. If you ever did wreck I could just imagine how much it would cost to do all of the repairs. Thats why I wouldn't suguest driveless cars.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4

Electronic cars can be vulnerable to hacking even in googles hands,without manual piloting a driverless car be a serious hazard on roads. if the LIDAR malfunctions the car is blinded and will most asurudely crash into its surroundings unless the person takes manual control.

Lawmakers know safety is best achieved with an alert driver,so traffic laws have made smart cars illegal even to test computer-driven cars in California, Nevada, and the District of Columbia.

23CE914BB7FE,"Though it may seem amazing to think about having driveless cars that can just drive us around, but what if a crash happens? Who will get blamed? The car or the driver that was supposed to be driving around. What happens if the car doesn't singal the driver that it needs help during traffic conditions or construction? This car shouldn't be developed, because it still needs technology to become a safer car. I don't approve of development of these cars, because innocent people may be blamed for an inccident that they didn't cause.

There are too many negative sides to the development of these cars on the roads and highways. Movies have influenced car companies to make this driveless car since the 2000s, which didn't have the money or technology to make then. We have all thought these cars would be the future and amazing to ride in. In these cars there are many sensors that are working all at the same time to keep the driver inside safe. What if one or two senors go are ruined by a bump in the road? Then the car would have problems with knowing what to do while driving and knowing what was surrounding the car. Still in the car, the driver still has to controll the car when it should be driverless. The driverless car needs assistance by the driver during road construction, traffic situations, and pulling in and out of driveway. All of these situations happen everyday and mostly everywhere on the road. This just means that the driver would have to still drive everywhere besides some places on the road. The driver would just get bored waiting for their turn to drive. What would happen if the car didn't notify the driver to take over the car? The effect of that situation would turn out to be a big crash or a swing and miss crash that almost would have killed the driver. As the law says,"" A safe car has the driver controlling the car at all times.""

The manufactors of these cars need to stop the development before someone gets blamed over a car's mistake. There are multiple conflicts with the development of this driveless car. What or who would be blamed if someone was injured? Sensors on the car could easily be broken and the car wouldn't be at it's best in safety for the driver. The best way to keep passengers, drivers, and pedestrians safe is to have an alert driver in control of the car. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
28DDECBB02BD,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author explains how driverless cars could be better for humans to arrive at their desinations but he also explains the negatives of the driverless car. Driverless cars is something everyone has wanted in their lifetime but it has never actually happened until now. Many car companies want to make driverless cars. Driverless cars could be more negative than postivie, because they could be more dangerous, they are useles, and gas prices may raise up very quickly.

Driverless cars could be more dangerous than safe for people to use. They sound like a better way to drive, but you still need to know how to drive in order to use this car. If the traffic is bad or there is road work, you need to drive manually. GM says they will have a drivers seat that viberates but what if the driver ends up falling asleep and the driver needs to drive but doesn't feel the vibration? The driver may end up in a car wreck and you may never know if the wreck could be serious one or just a minor one. Either way, the person got into a wreck. Many people still get in wrecks today but they won't depend on the car, it's all on them. The car may even slide while in a snow storm and if you drive on your own, you have a grater chance of preventing that.

Driverless cars can be very usless and a waste of money. Car companies will waste thousands, maybe even millions, of dollors just to make this car. Either way we will still need to learn how to drive. The car cannot drive everywhere. Like it stated in the article, we will still need to stay alert. After a while of just sitting there while the car drives on its own, it will get boring. You may even end up just driving like we do now. You will also need to drive in cartain cases since the car cannot drive through everything.

Since the driverless cars will have to use more energy, they will need more gas to run on. Gas prices have a grater chance of rising unexpectedly since the cars may need to run on a different fuel. If the cars do run on a different fuel, it could be harder to get than gas. Gas is already a bit expensive, just imagine if driverless cars do became a big thing? The fuel for driverless cars may be regualr gas that we have today or a different fuel, but either way there is a greater chance of fuel prices getting higher.

Having a driverless car is fun to think about having but not everyone will think about the negatives to it. They think they will arrive to their desination safe and sound without having to do anything since the car brought them. Not nessecarally.

26F26684B563,"In the article Driverless Cars Are Coming, the author has a ton of good points for driverless cars such as driverless cars insure more safty on the road. He also made a good point about the negative aspects of driverless cars. What if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer. I am going to make an arguement for the development of these cars, and at the end lets see how you feel about these cars.

The reasons I think that Driverless cars are good for the road are the following. My first reason is that I think that driverless cars will be very safe and will only benefit the driver in the car. My reason for that is driving regularly is very dangerous because of the fact that a lot people driving on the road distract themselves from the road. Like texting and driving, or bending down, and picking up the mccdonalds french fry you just dropped on the floor. With the driverless car you can do that and not be in danger of getting hurt. Actually some manufactures hope to interpret the driving fun in a new way, by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.

My sesond point is what if people say ""what if the car system fails"". Well in the driverless cars you can still take controll of the wheel whenever you please, and the system will stop. You will sometimes be required to take over the car in certain situations like, navagating through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers have actually created a seat in cars that vibrate to notify when they need to take over. My last reason is that driverless cars overall ensure more saftey because, they brake and have better reaction times then people.

In fact Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. That to me is crazy by the time im twenty i might be able to ride in a driverless car. That is why I agree that we should hope for the development of these cars.  ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4

First off, safety. Safety is probobly one of my main concerns. We all know that electronic devises bug out all the time. Lets say you have a very important meeting and your alarm on your phone doesnt go off. What does that cost you? Maybe your job or punisment for missing that meeting. Now imagion that instead of you phone its your car. Now instead of your job your life.

Secondly, money. Are economy isnt the best. So where would we get all this money for something that isnt completely nessasary. The writer states that not only would it take money for the sensors and the cars but also road. These ""Smart Road"" would need to be installed before any cars are even released. That takes time and money we dont have.

Is this really a good idea? The passage says, ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves."" I was aware that you arnt suppost to do things you see on t. v. Is this really what America is developing in its free time? We could be improving society. Cancer is something we have been working on for years and now there going to put time and money into something that we dont need.

What is the price range of these new cars? Will these new ""Smartcars"" be the same as a regular car? When they format the road will regular cars not use the roads? Will the poor and middle class be able to even drive if they cant affored a new Smartcar? These are questions that need anwsers if this idea will ever come into affect.

These types of carsstill have to have a human operate them when pulling into drivways, going around accdents, or having to deal with complicated traffic issues.

My position on driverless cars are, they should not be a thing. There would be more car wrecks than there are now. What if the car ends up turning at the wrong area and does not pick up that there is a car in front of them. The car would end up crashing and could the result could be life threatening. The car could have a bad sensor and just keep driving straight. Then, the car would end up hitting a pedestrian or another object.

There are positive sides to the driverless cars though. The cars will save individuals more on gas money. The driverless cars use only half of the fuel of today's taxis. They say that the driverless cars are also more flexible than a bus. You also would not have to have your hands on the steering wheel at all times. You can relax and just watch your surroundings. The car will alert you when you need to take control over the car again. You also would not have to buy a car because you could the driverless cars would be a public transportation like taxis.

There are more negative things about the cars then there are positive. What if the car just shuts down in the middle of the highway? More people are going to hit you and it will affect more people. What if the sensors are very sensitive and will detect a branch in the middle of the road? The car will stop and people will hit your bumper. There are a lot of dangerous and life threatening things about the driverless cars.

The driverless cars seem very neat but, they also seem very dangerous. Too many things could go wrong, like a sensor could go out and you could hit another vehichle. The car could miss the turn and you could hit a pedestrian or another object. If the sensors are very sensitive, they could detect the smallest thing like a small tree branch and cause your vehichle to stop in the middle of the road.

A639FEF0BE78,"Do Google cars truly work? Can humans completely trust a machine to do all of the work for them with their lives on the line? Although Google cars are really interesting and intelligent, these cars cannot be trusted. These cars can only help a person drive and alert them when the task is too hard for the car. All drivers must remain alert throughout the ride, and not everyone can stay alert. Also, what happens if the car ends up in an accident? Someone will have to pay for the price, which can cause immense conflict. Therefore, Google cars should not be produced and sold to customers, for it will cause conflict and danger for everyone.

In paragraph seven, the author states that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This statement means that the cars cannot drive completely by themselves and will need a person to be alert in case the road ""requires human skills."" Although the seat vibrates to get the driver's attention, it is possible that some will not be able to react quick enough, which may cause a severe car accident.

Because of this problem, people must stay alert just in case they go though a road that requires human skills. The author states that ""the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This may seem like a simple issue, but it isn't; people who drive for a long period of time will get bored if they drive the Google car. In paragraph eight, the author questions this by asking, ""wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" If people get bored of waiting for their turn, then they will do something to get rid of their boredom, hence leading to a terrible accident.

When someone runs into a car accident, most people would blame the driver. In paragraph eight of the excerpt, it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault---the driver of the manufacturer?"" Logically, both of them are at fault; the driver should have been paying attention, and the manufacturer should have known the consequences of selling the car. However, this will most likely unsatisfy the people. Everyone will get into a huge argument which will lead to an enormous conflict.

Google cars are an amazing invention, but it has some flaws; even if ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time,"" people should not trust the car. What about the other 10 percent? The 10 percent shows that it is possible that the car will get into accident, and that accident could lead to thousands of people dead. These accidents will most likely happen because people were not alert during the times they should have been. Can one trust these cars to take them anywhere with their lives on the line, or should they risk the 10 percent and hope for the best?    ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8

From time to time I ask my great grandmother questions about the life she had growing up and im always amazed by the comaparison to the life that I live. I have grown up with technology at my fingertips, techonology from the alarm that wakes me up to the music I listen to on my ipod when I go to sleep. Growing up I don't remember getting lost and having to ever ask for direcions when traveling out of state with my family. We simply used our GPS system. I like watching movies on the car when we go places, and I life the rear camara on the car that helps us drive safely. These new techonologies have made our lives much easier and thanks to those bright minds that have created and innovated the techonlogy we have.

As time goes by, we as a society must make progress, and its clear that we have. Along with progress comes some disagreements and possible dangers thanks to time and acceptace from our society we have made great improvements from, lets say the time my great grandma was just a young girl. From these I can say that when the question of driveless cars comes up I am all for it. I believe that having to get inside a smart car that ""could drive themselves"", is not a bad thing or idea at all.

""In the 1980's auto makers used speed secors in the creation of anti lock brakes. Within 10 years, those sencors became more advanced. Since 2009 Google has had cars that could drive themselves under under specific conditions."" The improvents cars have made have been done for own advantage and yes, one could arugue the dangers of having a driveless car, since a driveless car is not the same as just having better brakes or a Google car that still has a human in control of it but it's evident that since the past there have been innovations made to cars and our everyday lives that has only led to greater things through out the decades.

These new cars have challeges to overcome and these challeges are the reason some oppose the idea and in some states it is even illegal to even test computer driven cars. Some question their safety and liability in the case of an accident but like anything new it has to start from somewhere in order to improve. To this day auto makers are continuing their work on the assuption that problems ahead will be solved and as a member of the future I look foward to those soutions and the positive changes it may bring and I want to be able share progress stories one day of how far we have come.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
7B63367C69B4,"Driverless cars are an amazing thing. Technology has improved quite a lot due to the fact that we can know make these. Even though they seem cool there are actually many downsides to driverless cars. Driverless cars should not be used on the roads. Driverless cars may seem cool to everyone now but nowing the downsides will change people's minds.

One of the first issues with driverless cars is the issue with driving in traffic. When one is in difficult traffic the car can not drive itself. It would need to human to take full control. If the point of driverless cars is to not have to pay attention and let the car do all of the work then the cars should be fully equipped to drive itself in traffic.

The biggest issue with these driverless cars is the legal issues. If one gets into a crash because the technology of the car freaks out then whose fault is it? If someone else in another car is injured who takes the blame: the human or the company who made the car? Many laws would have to be changed in order to put these cars out on the roads. Liability laws are set in place for humans driving cars because that is the way the world works; humans drive cars, cars do not drive humans.

Lastly how ""self-driving"" are drivereless cars. There are not any cars out right now that are one hundered percent driverless. The driverless cars right now can accelerate, steer, and brake but, they notify the human in the car when there are sites up ahead that involve human interaction. This would be things such as work zones, accidents, etc... Due to these issues the human driver would always have to be on alert. These cars are not equipped to handle the roads yet.

All in all, these cars may seem like a cool idea but they have many downsides. This world is not ready to put out driverless cars on the roads until we know they can fully drive themselves without any human interaction and liability laws are changed. The risks with these cars are not one that the world is ready to take.                              ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
8AFEAAB30C00,"Have you ever wondered that in the future it might be driverless cars. I personally think that it should be driverless cars because of what it can do to us in the future. Let's say that your'e driving for 4 hours straight with no sleep on a highway and the car takes over if you fall asleep while driving. Well that's when the driverless cars come in handy. So my question is that are driverless cars going to take over in the future?

First, let's talk about how can the cars be driverless. Well Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Google cars aren't completely driverless because someone is actually inside that takes over if it looks like something is in the way. In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. So do you think cars can really be driverless.

Secondly, what can driverless cars do? For the driverless cars it needs a whole lot of sensors so that it can identify where the car is going or what's in the way of the car. Googled modified the Toyota Pruis so that it can be almost like a driverless car with so high tech things on it. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

Lastly, is the cars assisting or are you driving? Sebastian Thrun the founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up the the dream. In the driverless car do you think that you are driving or is it assisting you while you drive the car. I think that the car is assisting you because why would it be called the ""driverless"" car. In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" Basically what it is that they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves.

In conclusion, do you think driverless cars are going to take over in the future? I think they will because most people will get tired of diving everywhere they go so the driverless cars will help them out. It really started in the late 1950s General Motors created a car that can drive on a special track by itself. Originall, many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads.

ED27B5020694,"The Battle for Control

In the near future, driveless cars will become an inevitable reality. Their a supposed solution for most traffic problems the world posseses today. No need to worry about drunk and reckless drivers anymore, the answer is finally here! Well, dive a little deeper and you'll figure out that driveless cars will create just as many problems as they would, in theory, fix. The idea of a world with driveless cars as the main priority just runs shivers down my spine...

The main problem with driveless cars is a very nightmarish one. What if the car malfunctions, and goes completely berzerk on the road? Also, who would take the blame for the accident? The manufacturers or the driver would be a re-occuring question, and as stated in the article, this would cause thousands of legal battles every week. It would be truly heartbreaking to go to someone's funeral that you were very close with, and to always know that their death wasn't even their fault.

Another issue driveless cars would create is immense laziness and health problems. Although driving cars isn't an amazing workout by any means, it keeps the brain alert and stimulated. Also, if there is no work needed then many passengers would just fall asleep. Who is there to wake them up when they have reached their destination? A siren or alarm would be a good idea, but many people including myself are very heavy sleepers.

My biggest gripe with driveless cars would be the easy accessibilty. Literally anyone could just hop in and take control of it. Kids who have an argument with their parents and are currently angry at them can just get in one, and drive off. This completely kills the purpose of drivers licences, and in my opinion just isn't right. Another HUGE problem is this, how in the world would police do their job? Would their cars be driveless also, and how would they pull anyone over? They wouldn't be able to, the driveless cars would just continue cruising down the street.

In my honest opinion, a world with driveless cars would just be the beginning of a world ruled by computer A.I. Humans need to keep control of certain things in order for our species to thrive and survive. Not everything needs to be taken over by computers, and I truly wish that we as a species can realize this. We are becoming too dependent on technology, and I fear that soon our own knowledge will eventually cause the end of the human race as we know it. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
815D2A09CF1B,"Boom! Tire blows. Only if the driverless car, supposly a smart car, senn the road construction ahead it could of prevented the accident. Then the sensors for the cars I know will take weeks to put all of them in to properly work. Also how is it suppose to be a smart car when you still have to hold the wheel at all times. Although it might have some positives about the car, it still has a numerous number of negitives such as: if the driverless car goes to fast do you get a ticket and have to pay or what is the consequences.

First and foremost, the sensors on the smart cars. It must take a fortune to buy and apply every single little sensor thats need daily on the rode. Plus it must take alot of people to do that and you have to pay them a lot as well so that means you're going to spend so much money that you're going to try and sell it for a huge price of change that no one has to spend. Or the timing, it probably take one/fourth of the time it take to make that robot car.

Moreover, you have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. What if you're taking a rode trip and you want to get some rest, you can't because your handle has to be positioned on the wheel at all times. Also if you have a important meating and you are trying to finish up your presentation,you can't. Eventhough it might do some incredible things but it aslo can mouth-function and leave you stranded.

Equally important, what about the laws for the car. Most importantly i want to know who gets the ticket and pays for it if the car gets pulled over if going to fast is it you or the manufacturing company. Then it could overide and take far away from where you need to be because the smart car is really like a colassal mobile computer. If it over heats and blows who get blamed for someones death.

Overall, I disaggre and also disapprove this vehicle. As a driver and owner of a smart car i would rather have it Barren like the ones we drive daily thats less worries. Also cheaper to get fixed and worked on then getting my car reprogramed and a whole new pc system in it.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
A0FF0BAD9C64,"Today, there are advance technology in the society such as computers, cars, cell phones, and etc but no one ever tried to develop an driverless cars. Today in our society, many people tried to develop new technologies because things are getting more advanced an effective. Driverless cars are one of their plan, where the cars has sensors and know what to do. I agree the development of driverless cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there is still alert in the car.

The driverless cars should be develop and introduced to the soiety because the cars uses less fuel than the cars we used today. The text states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" From this example we can tell that the cars is great because they used less fuel than the the cars we sued today. Thus, people do not have to worried about they will ran out the fuel when they're driving. Most of the people loved to use cars that used less fuels because they do not have to spend much money on the fuel. The text also states, ""Offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This example shows that the driverless cars have more rooms than a bus. People to sit in a place where there is not croweded because it's comfortable. Driverless cars solved the overcroweded the problem because it got more spaces. Thus, I agree the development of the cars.

While the driverless cars used less fuel, the cars can drive million miles without a crash. The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half million miles without a crush."" This example tells us that the car is safer than the cars we drive today. If a car can drive million miles without any crashing then we considered it's an great car because most of the cars were not safe and it gets into car accident very often.

The most important is that there are still alert in the car. The text states, ""...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of hallways."" This example shows that when there is something happened to the car, the cars will alert the driver that there is something going on but most of the cars do not have that kind of technique. Second, the text states, ""Dealing with comlicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This example shows that when there is an major accidents or traffic issues then the car will alert you to move out the car quickly before anything happened. In other hand, people disagree to develop the driverless cars. The text states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless cars that still needs a driver?"" They claimed that the driverless cars should do everything by itself instead having the dirver controlling it. They think there is no difference if we use a normal car. I disagree with them because it's safer if we have a real driver in the car, they'll prevent anything bad happened.

Driverless cars can have more advanced technique in the future when there are more people supporting it. Thus, we should not give up on developing the cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there are still alert in the car that helped people to know what happened.

They have been in the world since 2009 but we have never seen them on the road yet because we live in Indiana.

California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have limited self-driving cars.

Manufacturers believe that in the future there will be more of these types of cars and they will help the community significantly.

In the article it sais that googles Toyota Prius are assisted with ''position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearveiw mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.''

They fully loaded the car to be very protected at all times but its not like they cant break or just not work.

The technology coul go out and something could happen to the people in the inside of the car causing severe injuries or even perhaps death.

In the article it also sais ''The most important bit of technology in this system in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof.

Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.

The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skil of a human at the wheel.''

It sounds very secure and safe but at the same time anything can happen and we dont know how much the repair could be if something like this equipment broke down and could funtion properly.

The driverless car in my opinion should just stay away from the roads because there could be a huge amount of disaster if one of the operating systems goes wrong and it coould put us humans at risk of being hurt.

In 2013 they said that they put a ''Traffic Jam Assistant'' on a 2013 BMW.

It can drive its self with the help sometimes of a human touch if in any trouble.

Manufactures sais that they will have a camera in a car and will watch the person as the person watches the road. Manufactures are also bring a system to where if the human needs to drive then they can turn off the system and they can start to drive without it.

I agree with this part because if the car is driving and he human is faling asleep then the cars with cameras will notify them by vibrating the seats and waking the person up.

The thing i disagree with is the car driving by itself because if that does evolve to regular society, then I think we will have something else to deal with.

Have saying this in 2016 it sais that ''Tesla is releasing a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time.

Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can truly drive themselves by 2020.''

A2A80E683990,"The article ""Driverless cars are coming"" is a very encouraging on the behalf of driverless cars. these cars would be very helpful to those who text and drive. Sergey Brin, cofounder to Google believes that soon noone should even need cars.

In 2009,Google had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions. their cars have drieven more than half a million miles without crashing, but these cars aren't exactly completely driverless. For example, if you were to buy a driverless car you'd stil have to stay alert, like any other non-driverless car, but you'd be able to take your eyes off the road for about 30 seconds. If you'll have to pay attention to the car as its driving, you'd have better luck just driving it yourself. if theres an accident, traffic issues,or roadwork, you'll end up being the one who has to drive for who knows how long. i think that i'd have better luck just driving on my own.

People have been fascinated with driverless cars since the late 1950's. For example, in the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a soecial track. this track had been embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineer at Berkeley tried the same thing but this time they used magnetics with alternating polarity. The car would read positive and negative polarity messages in Binary code. The ""smart-road"" systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to the existing roads, but they were way to expensive.

In the 1980's automakers would use speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock breaks. Within 10 years, these sensors had become more advanced to detect and resopnd to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. this alowed better response and control than any human could manage alone.

Sebastian Thrun, founder of the google car project, believes that the technology has finally began to catch up to the dreams. Before the 2000's, they didn't have all the sensors, the computers, or the mapping. the Radar was a device that cost two hundred thousand milion dollars.

In 2013, BMW announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car could handle driving speeds up to 25 mph. This car had special touch sensors to make sure thatthe driver keeps their hands on the wheel. The cars could steer,accelerate, and brake themselves, but if there were any traffic incidents, the car would require human skills. This means that the driver would have to stay alert as if they were driving. To keep the driver alert, GM has developed seats that vibrate the driver's seat when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The google the car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over the wheel. Also, other options for the cars driver to stay alert is flashing on the windshield and on the heads up displays. Manufacturing is also considering cameras to watch the driver or make sure that they are remaining focused on the road. I don't believe that a want a car watching me when i know its somebody else video taping me and my family. Think of how akward that would feel having a computer watch your every move in your car.

They think that the driver would get tired of waiting on their turn to drive. If you are a 15, 16, or 17 year old teenager who is figuring out how to drive,you'll get tired of waiting to drive, you'll be ready to put your hands on the wheel and show everyone that you've grown up. Dr. Werner, a BMW project manager driver says that ""we have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" Some Manufactures hope to do that by bringin in car entertainment. THe purpose of the driverless car is to help texting and driving, this helps by keeping more teens out of accidents.

In my conclusion i think that driverless cars would be a waste of time because you'll still have to be alert, they'll puit camera's in your car and people shouldn't be texting and driving anyway, if its that important to text they should of took the bus. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
5E9964522D41,"In the course of human existance, humanity has always been striving for progress, you might say going the extra mile, in order to better our society. One such great invention was the automobile which allowed us to travel great distances in a short period of time. Consequently, the natural instinct, to grow and improve, has been transfered to the idea of the automobile through the self driving car. Self driving cars are the future of transportation as the offer a host of positive benefits including, precise driving capabilities, increasing affordability, and new safety technology.

The self driving car has begun implementing technology that can revolutionize a car's self awarness. For example the article states, ""spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings."" Unlike the human eye, the LIDAR radar sees anything and everything; not only does it never miss a single detail, but it also has a 360 degree view that current drivers simply do not possess. These sensors are expecially useful when backing up and driving backwards, as many drivers struggle with getting a full view of what goes on behind them. However, with the LIDAR radar, this problem is eliminated, making backwards driving easier. Putting radar into the drivers seat is not so much about losing the human touch of driving, but getting a more accurate perspective on the road.

Secondly, the technology is finally in a place where self driving cars are becoming a feasible economic option. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the self driving Google car, said, ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there...Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars."" In fact, alot of the technologies, including radar, used in self driving cars have been around for a long time. However, in recent years, they have become alot cheaper and precise, so that the dream of creating a self driving car is a reality. The goal of the self driving car was never to create a billion dollar high tech vehicle accessible only to the rich, but one that could be mass produced and avaliable to all. With cheaper, mass produced technology, it seems like this is not too far up the road.

Finally we see that the self driving car may actually be safer that regular drivers. With so many deaths accounted to texting and driving, the idea is that people would be able to safely text when the car drives itself certainly has its appeal. However, when the car needs a human touch, ""displays [texting] can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not avalible to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" Shutting off the display would force drivers to pay attention to the road during tricky situations and reduce the number of car crashes. Secondly, the use of sensors helps detect and prevent crashes. The article says, ""sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. This information from the sensor can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels,"" which could stop potential dangers in their tracks that the driver may not be aware of. In the end, a self autonomus car is always vigilant and is never distracted, making it safer than having a human driver.

Self autonomous cars are more accuate, becoming cheaper, and are safer than today's cars, making them the car of the future. It is only a matter of time before someone develops a self driving car that can be mass produced, and when that day comes, we should embrace it with pride. Together, let's drive towards creating the car of tommorow, today.

What happens if one of those cars goes under a super malfunction or some of its safety units stop working for whatever reason and there is someone or multiple people in that certain car. But, then again they could prone some serious accidents and save a lot of lives. For example, the passage stated that the car is smart enough to know its limits on what it can and can't do. It also gives off certain signals to the driver such as vibrating seats to notify the driver that the vehicle is about to back into to something and flashing lights on the windshield. It even uses a camera to see that the driver is still alert and focused on the road.

C2766158A80A,"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is writes mostly in favor of driverless cars but adds some valid points as to why these cars may not be the best decision. I believe that the latter opinion is the logical stance. If completely driverless cars were to exsist in the furture the human race would lose one more skill due to technology. On top of this loss of skill there runs the risk of computer malfuntion within the car, legal issues if and when these cars get into an accident, and people attempting to hack the cars' computer system in an attempt to kill someone.

If these are created into exsistence then people will no longer posses the abilily to drive their own car. While this may seem like a good thing these cars will not be able to do everything a human typically can do in avoiding an accident. When a situation occurs that there may be an accident there may be an opportunity for the ""driver"" to take over. Unfortunatly, this will be pointless because these ""drivers"" will no longer know how to control their own cars.

Furthermore, if and when this accident happens, who will take the blame for its cause. Will it be the drivers fault, the car's fault, or the manufacturers fault?

This is a point that is brought up in paragraph 9, ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault -the driver or the manufacturer?"" A whole new set of laws will be needed in order to accomadate this new type of car. Even if new laws are created for these cars and it is made easier to have someone take the blame for an accident how will anyone know if it is truly their fault?

Besides the loss of skill and the legal issues for if and when these cars malfuntion, there is also an issue of these cars being easily hacked. It is getting easier and easier for people to acces sensitve information with everything thing being placed online and creating these cars is just adding another thing to be hacked. It is a very real possiblies that someone may hack into a world leaders car and try to crash it in an attempt at an assination. If this does happen the public would no longer be able to feel safe in even our cars and would be at the mercy of these online hackers.

I believe that, while having driverless cars would be an amazing feat in humankind's technological advancement, there are too many risks involved if these cars are created. We would be losing another skill to technology, computers malfunction on occasion and when one of these car's computer malfuntions and causes a crash who will take the balme, and people with these cars will be putting there lives in the hands of these compurters and the people with the skill to hack and control these computers.

The driver would still have to take control of the car when traveling through traffic, passing an accident, or traveling through road work. Even though the driverless car has sensors, anitlock breaks, and driver assistance is it safe?

My position on the driverless car is undecided. I believe that this car has outstanding safety features but it also has some down falls. The outstanding features that this car has include getting the drivers attention if need and driving assistance found in the car. The car is to get the drivers attention if the road ahead requires human skills. For example the drivers seat can vibrate or flashing lights found on the windshield can aleart the driver that they need to take control of the car. The down falls of this car to me would be the ability to not be able to see something aorund the car. The driverless car has many sensors, which is good until they break. If one breaks and the driver does not know then the car could wreck and hurt others or the driver. Also another down fall is the cost of the car. If something breaks on the car the price of that part will be very expensive. I for see only people with higher incomes having these cars.

If I decided to be for the car I would like all of the safety features found on the car. I would feel safe while traveling in this car because of the features. The driverless car would be a good family car and would also help save money. By saving money this could allow a family to do other things with each other instead of using it on a car. I think the driverless car is a great idea for the new generation but I feel that the older generations will turn this car down due to unkown facts about the new car.

If I decided to be against the car I would have an unsafe feeling about the car. The dirverless car has many sensors and safety features but what happens when those break while driving. If they break while driving will the car wreck? Will it aleart the driver? How do you know when a sensor has gone out? All of these questions are left unanswered. This car could be a huge distraction to the driver and other people around that car. This could cause accidents, death, and severly injure people. I would rather be in a car where I am in control and I don't have to worry about my car taking care of me.

The driverless cars created today have magnificent safety features but are they safe? The cars safety features include sensors, antilock breaks, and drivers assistance. The first car was made by Google in 2009 and has traveled many miles without a crash. I believe that there is good things about this car and bad things. A good thing about this car is all the new technological safety features put in this car to keep everyone in the car safe and everyone around the car safe. A bad thing about this car is what happens when the sensors break. Does the car tell you? Are you suposed to check before you get in the car? Do the sensors even break? There are many questions left unanswered to me and that makes me be against this car being allowed on the road. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6

Sure, there would probably be less accidents and less rule breaking but in the long run, that would cause a lot of unemployment. If people no longer have to drive themselves, that would mean that police men would not need to arrest people from the road. Although that seems like a good thing (and it is meaning that there will be less accidents), not every police man can be a detective. In that case, there would be less job oppotunities and more unemployment with, which seems to be a more important issue than having possible car trouble.

If people would be a little more responsible in the way they drive, there would be no need to make cars that drive themselves.

BBBEFA892C88,"Are self-driving cars really safe for the future?

Driving has been around for decades. It goes so far back. Now soon there will be no need for driving at all. Car will have to have a mind of their own. They'll need to know how to handle difficult situations. This will cause people to have to be attentive more than ever. I believe self-driving cars will be taken lightly and people will think they don't have to pay as much attention as they would a regular manual car.

what do we really need selfdriving cars for anyways? I don't believe that a elecronic will be able to deal with other driving humans better than another human can. Say someone is driving an manual car and go on a four way stop at the wrong time. The car wouldn't know what to do unless its programed to do so. People may say The cars have sensors so it will be able to stop it's self. What if the sensor is broken? There will need to be way to tell that its broken. There will also be othe asspects of the car the driver will need to keep up with which will make this a high mantance car.

Along with this if there was to be an acident who would be responible? According to the article that is yet to be decided. There are still states that don't allow any driverless cars in their state which means everyone is not on borad with this idea. Its still people who think this idea is not safe. Also in these cars it is alot easier to be distracted. Like the article says some can get bored waiting on their time to drive. The driver can fall asleep, start using there phone, etc. Which could be dangerous for the manual drivers.

There are some positves to this car for some people. These cars could be good for new drivers who don't know how to parrallel park. Teen drivers don't always get everything right the first couple of times so they will ahve their car to assitst them. This car could also accually be safer for mothers with multipule children. It may give her a chance to quickly distribute a bottle or pick up a toy a baby dropped. This also can still be dangerous because the driver won't be attentive.

In conculdion i believe there is no point of taking time to make a driverless car because You will always have to be attentive just like driving a regular car, and if you aren't and get into an accident it may end up being your own fault. The driver would have to be dependent on their car to avoid accidents, construction, wrong turns ,etc. Will you be able to trust you car with your life?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6

The developement for these cars would not be such a great idea to make. Producing vehicles with such improvements can cause many bad problems to surface in court and society as a whole. The reasoning behind these improvements being negative is safety of people. Peoole should to look at the things that might go wrong before they support something that sounds good.

Technology is a major factor in todays society and we use it everyday in life, but if the technology we have sold to us has issues then it should not be sold to the people until the issue is completely resolved. If the driverless cars are manufactured and sold to people and there is a problem within the cars which causes them to make mistakes and have technical issues. The manufacturers are not just putting the people riding the car at risk, they are putting the lives innocent pedestrians at risk also. There is a point made in the article where it states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or manufacture?"". The point being made from this specific sentence is that if the cars are opperating by themselves and if something happens to anyone the only person to blame is the creator of the vehicle, the manufacturer. In most states it is illegal to test computer driven cars because of the dangers that are most likely to occur. In the article we are introduce to a statement which says,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human in control at all times"". This statement is saying that if a human has control then everything should be fine. These are overall reasonings and explinations for why driverless cars should not be manufactured.

Manufacturing driverless cars would not be a great idea to make for peoples overall safety. The cars would be unsafe to people as a whole and cause major issues in court as for lawsuits.

They would also make taking long roadtrips much more enjoyable, being that you would not always have to keep starring at the road ahead in the long, boring sort of way that we have to now.

Driverless cars would also be great for public transportation, being that they could exempt the need for a driver, that would allow companies to make more profit, which in turn would allow for better up-keep on the buses, trams, etc. Also allowing for newer and better modes of transportation to be purchased, all around it would benefit the public transportation industry.

Even if we did not have autonomous, driverless, cars the roads would still be better if we had cars that sensed the road conditions and kept track of the driver to help with accident prevention. It would decrease the number of deaths caused each year by distracted driving, and also maybe even help make the human population as a whole better drivers in the fact that we would realize all of the things that we do wrong while driving and maybe try to correct those things.

Then there is the other side to the autonomous, driverless, cars. Yes they would be good because they would decrease the number of accidents that are caused by distractred dirvers, but this may also be a bad thing. Most humans, if you give them something that can make them have to work less, will rely souly on that one product to do all that it can possibly do to help them, but when that product has a malfunction it could be disasterous.

Lets use this as an example, Johnny and a few of his friends are driving up twisty mountain road in his autonomous car, Johnny, relying on his autonomous car to do its job of driving, is paying no attention to the road ahead. The driving system of the car has a small malfunction in the turning system, the road takes a sharp right turn and the cars is going too fast to recognize that the turn is up ahead, the car comes up to the turn, goes to fast around the turn and starts to slip, the car then overcorrects sending Johnny and all of his friends straight into the side of the mountain.

Now see this would have been no problem had Johnny been paying attention to the road ahead, but he thought that his autonomous car had it all under control.

I also believe the driverless cars could put the country in even more debt.

In paragraph six they state that¨Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.¨

The last time I herd the United States was eight trillion dollars in debt, should we really consider adding two hundred million per radar to that eight trillion?

I also would like to go back to the subject of malfuctioning.

If a driverless car malfunction, the company could possibly and most likely be sewed, we would have even more money added to that debt to try to prevent it from happening again and no one really knows spending all that money would even prevent it from malfunctioning again, and lastly we would have some very unhappy customers on our hands.

We could be talking riots, people wanting their money back, shootings, killing.

3DD4E618CC93,"The further development of driverless cars should be pursued in their respective manner. It should be taken in to consideration that technology will be upgraded and evolve to better suit and cater to human needs as people progress throughout time.

A lot of people will not have the oppurtunity to have their driver's license, and some will not be allowed to retain one. In the even that one does have their license, they may not have access to their own car if they live in a large, populated city. That leaves them to hail a taxi, catch the bus, or the train/subway. Not all of these are reliable sources of transportation. Taxi or alternative transportation drivers will run late, get lost, or unfortunately, get in an accident. A subway or a bus could also be running late, or be involved in an accident. A smart, self-driving care could cut down on navigational problems as well as time managment.

Though a driverless car is still in its infancy, many developments and advances have made the concept worthy of further thought, investment and speculation. While the car would still need a human driver to be alert and take the wheel in a sophisticated or compromising situation the car does not yet know how to deal with, the car remains as a safe and advanced way of articulate and advanced driving. This would also help developments in how to make a car drive effeciently in the even of a car accident, or roadwork is being performed.

In the financial state, smart cars would be a much less expensive than a smarter road, which would be equipped with magnets or another energy source that would send signals to the car. Of course, those roads would have to be upgraded, that upgrade would come out of taxpayers pockets and the government as well.

The one thing holding back tests and further advancements for this futurisic riding service would be the law. While it is still assumed in most states in America, that the only safe kind of car is the car with a driver, it should be considered that humans still must trust themselves behind the wheel instead of the driver beside, behind, or in front of them, since not everyone's judgement is on the same wave-length as the others.

In fact, there is already a car out on the market that has a safety feature that allows the car to stop itself if there is a hint of danger, in the even that the driver's reflexes are not fast enough, or just simply cannot stop the car. The possibility of a safe, self-driving car is not a far leap as it may seem. After all, America has put man on the moon, and is working to do the same thing with Mars, already having two rovers on the red planet. There are satellites and spacecrafts that leave our solar system without the help of the human hand. The Hubble Space Telescope sends pictures to its headquarters on its own accord.

If all of those achievments can be done, why not a driverless car? it was thought impossible to send a human in space, much less on our moon, but that has been said and done, time and time again. The only thing keeping this project of more efficient cars and driving tethered to a chain is doubt and second thought.

An entertainment system is a disaster waiting to happen. Some states have made it illegal to test computer-driven cars. Other states have limited the use of semi-autonomous cars. I believe the reason for this is because technology is never one hundred percent safe.

The first reason I think driverless cars should be developed is because they cause less accidents. These cars cause less accidents because they are sensored causing the car causing the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. These cars allow better resonse and control than human driver manage alone just from sensors and makes driving safer for people. The driverless cars also has vibrating seat belts when the vehicle is in danger of backing into a object. So this is the first reason why I think driverless cars should be developed.

The second reason why I think driverless cars should be developed is because they have far more flexibility than a bus. By developing driverless cars people dont have to worry about being late for work because the bus is too slow or is making too many stops. By having a driverless car people would be able to get to work,school,or anyother place they want to on time.

Although the government makes assumptions that there is no safe car without a human driver, the steps being taken towards a future with driverless cars are showing a different alternative to human drivers.

Many of these driverless cars still require a form of human drivers to guide vehicles through special situations such as road blocks or work zones however, there are now many driverless vehicles that can transport a passenger without any problems. As these vehicles become more popular, affordable, and practical in everyday life it will cause a change in the driver laws for human controlled and driverless cars. With projected release dates for these modern vehicles approaching so fast it is now time for us to begin thinking about the future. Driverless cars are the future.

There is a future for driverless cars and that future is now. Driverless cars have the ability to change lives positively and remove many of the dangerous actions we face now in driving. There will be no more fear of texting and driving or an adult not being able to focus on the road while checking their child. No more fear of drunk drivers or operators under the influence. Driverless cars are more important to the safety of our country than many realize.

So let's begin to take the initiative to bring driverless cars to the forefront of technology and make these technologies accessible to the public. There is a great need for these products that must be filled as soon as possible. Driverless cars are the future and that future is now the present.  ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
63FD0F019B15,"Driverless cars should not be something that is utilized this early on in time. Driverless cars could be a high advancement in autonomous technology, however, the safety risks and other such cons outweigh the benefits. These vehicles do not have the evidence to support that they would definitely be one hundred percent safe when driving out and about the actual roads of life. Granted that Google does have test runs that have occured on controlled courses, but these can be very very different from actual public streets. Driverless cars put our own people at risk solely because some would like to be lazy and not have to drive themelves.

Driverless cars pose a large threat to the general populace. These autonomous vehicles could potentially take hundreds of lives a year; possibly thousands. Although there may be some good things about switching to autonomous cars, there are many more bad. These cars are robotic, and not human operated. The human brain has a very efficient way of knowing when something is unsafe, and preventing that from happening. These cars couldn't notice if there were road traffic ahead, and if they were to continue driving, it could cause an accident. The same scenario goes for if there were someone walking across the road, a pedestrian.

The idea of putting a camera into this car to watch the driver is ludicrous. Privacy is a very big deal these days, and there aren't many who'd sacrifice that for anything. The fact that the driver would be continually watched whhile in the car would turn many people away instantly. Judging by the risks involved in this vehicle, it may take a lot to get it approved, and if nothing else, you should try to have the people on your side.

Another issue of these unmanned vehicles is the limit of travel. What if somebody were wanting to go on a road trip? These vehicles surely only have a specific operating range, judging by the fact that they were said to be put in place of a taxi service. The efficiency isn't enough to outweigh all of these risks and con's. The safety risks and other such con's outweigh the benefits of driverless cars, however, they have the potential be a high advancement in autonomous technology.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6
EB2A5BFC0B1A,"Have you ever had a dream about a car driving itself while you just layed back and relaxed? So have many other people. Companies have been working on developing a self driving car. There have been hopes and stories about this since as early as the 1950's, but now we have the technology to actually do this wonderful thing.

At the beginning of this experimentation for the self driving car, lots of people trying to get it to work were using ""smart"" roads. Roads that had electrical cables or magnets in it, but the cost for ""smart"" roads would not be worth it. ""Smart"" cars though are cheaper than fixing and replacing all of the roads in the world. ""Smart"" cars had many sensors, video cameras, and a GPS receiver. They have a sensor on top of the car that is constantly making a three-dimentional model of the cars surrounding so the car can react to what is going on around it.

The Google ""smart"" cars have been in progress since the year 2009. Their cars have driven a bit over half a million miles, and the cars have yet to get into an accident. So by logical conclusion, the ""smart"" cars reduce the accidents that happen or at least reduce the frequency. Then cars are still not fully done. Yet some places are allowing companies to test the cars out on open roads, such as: California, Florida, District of Columbia, and Nevada. Sadly these cars are not fully complete so some still need the assistance of humans when it comes to accidents or moving to avoid the work zones.

""Smart"" cars are very useful and have alot of wonderful benifits to them. These cars will very much likely use less fuel than the average car or taxi. They are less pron to get into accidents than human driven cars. They will take a bit more supplies to make these cars be able to do everything the need to be able to do to handle the real roads, but with all the money saved on fuel and all the money saved on not having as many accidents, it will all be worth it.

These ""smart"" cars are revolutionary and are changing the world, and as science continues to change and evolve each day, I'm sure we will soon aceive the goal of a car that con completely drive on its own with no human help. They take less gas and reduce the number of accidents. Who can complain with that. What do you say? Are you for or against self driving cars?",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.2

Fully automated acrs may be a cool idea depending on hopw manufactures persue these ideas. Immagine needing to go on a long trip and not having to stay awake for the whole drive, then immedately crashing when you get to your destination. immagine being able to sleep while you travel the world in the comfort of your own car. Imagine not having to focus on the rad at all and be able to take part in conversations and games while driving on the road. this could be our future, but may not be a a very safe one.

In the story it says,""Presently, Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in controll at all times."" I agree with this statement because what would happen if an automated car ""looses connection""or ""dies while on the road"" resulting in a collision causting people their lives? who would be at fault? You? the Manufacturer? things like this have to be discused before you can even think about seeing a fully automated car in any future. Regulations need to be set so we can pass laws that allow SAFE automated cars in all of the world.

Automated cars will be a neat idea to bring to life, but it might be a little bit further into the future than you might think, but it may be the next big step in public transportaton.

I think driverless car are cool but are they all safe? One of my negitives is that the cars might malfuction and make you get in a accident and cause harm to the driver in the car, and if your just sitting there will the cars diving it will be a easy way for you to dose off and fall asleep, but in the section ""Driving Or Assisting?"" in parigraph eight they talk about they can put entertainment in to the driverless cars and have an heads up display and when its turn for the driver to take over it will instantly turn off for the driver to drive. Some of my positives of the driverless cars are that if you late for work but didn't have time to eat breakfast then you can eat it in the car while the driverless car is driving or you could do your hair if you had to rush and all you could do is shower and get dressed. Or you have to talk on the phone for work or something because if you dont have a blutooth then you can't really drive with the phone in your hand and and you could get pulled over and get a ticked.

but one more negitive is that people might take avantige of the driverless car and on the weekend go out and get jrunk the think it'ssafe because the car an drive by its self and the car could malfuntion and then get inaccident and when the cops come the person in the car will be the blaim because they were drunk then they will go to jail. so there gose my nigitives and positives of driverless cars .",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.2

The making of these driverless cars would cost a fortune. The final product would not be worth the time or money put into the invention itself. Millions of dollars would be spent in order to make this dream a reality. All so that the people on this Earth can become more lazy and more distracted. No one really needs self driving cars. They would be nice to have because we are a lazy species. It would not be prudent to put the time or the money into building a driverless car.

Safety wouldn also be a big reason I would not want a driverless car. All of these cars would revolve around robets and technology. The human would have no control over their safety. If I had to make the decision, I would want to be in control of my safety as much as possible. Sometimes you can stop the crash, but I would rather be in control then have a robot be the driver.

Driverless cars are a good dream, but are not logical. The money and time put into these cars would not be worth the final product that is produced. Also, a robot would be in control of the humans safety. I think more problems could go wrong if a robot was in control rather than a human. A Human should control their own safety.

The reason why self-driving cars should be manufactured is because it can stop ,or help prevent less accidents from happening. If theres less people in the car, then there are less people to get hurt ,and if the car is driving it going to be safe to have the car drive its self because its programed to make the best decision to keep the passenger others safe. BMW is making a car with a in-car safety feature to reduce the use of cellphones being used while behind the wheel. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have all allowed limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Companies and people wouldn't want to make or buy the cars if they weren't proven to be as safe as possible. It also said in paragraph 5, that they have cars that auto lock the breaks to make it safer. Self driving cars could also reduce the percentage of DUI related car accidents, and deaths by having the car drive for you instead of anyone risking getting put in jail or getting pulled over. Paragraph 4 also says that the cars will have a lot of sensors on them to detect any obstacles and for the car to be aware of its surroundings at all times.

EB7AEA0197E2,"In the article the author wrote positives and negatives about self driving cars I am going to write about the positives of the slef driving cars bcause in my opinion self driving cars would be a great thing to have.

In this prompt im going to write about self driving cars. I think self driving cars would be a good thing to have because if you have a baby in the car and their bottle fell on the floor you could turn around and get it because you would have a self driving car and you wouldnt have to worry about getting in a wreck because the self driving cars like the prius have sensors that make a three D model of evrything around it so it can drive like a normal human did. I think that everyone should have a self driving car because they seem to be a safer car if the driver gets distracted easily. I also think they would be safer because googles self driving cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Google cars are not truly drivless the car alerts the driver when its pulling in or out of a driveway, dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. An example about the Toyota prius being safe "" spinning sensor on the roof, dubbed lidar , it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

Sensors on the self driving cars have started in the 1980's automakers made speed sensors for the antilock brakes. Within 10 years the sensors had become more advanced to detect and respondto the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine , allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. All the improvments to computer software and hardware is making driving safer and leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

Everything in those two paragraphs are telling about how safe the self driving cars are and how they operate and in the last paragrach they talk about how they are becoming better with all of the computer software and hardware improving. All of this information is why I believe having a self driving car would be safe and a good idea.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4
D96D74EBD6C0,"Technology is gradually developing as we go into the future. New inventions are being created everyday, such as driveless cars. When you think of driveless cars you may picture things like you see in the movies, but they are much more complex. I personally think that the developement of driveless cars is a good thing and will benefit us later in the future.

In the article, the author believes.""Driveless cars will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus"". As you can see driveless cars will benefit the earth and the needs of humans. The company,Google, has had independent driving cars since the year 2009. Their research states that their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. This research shows that the developing of driveless cars is improving and actually becoming a product that will later be in use.

Although these cars are categorized as independent, they still require the alertness of the driver. The car itself will need the driver's assistence when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with traffic issues. I believe that the car not having complete independence will actually benefit the driver. Since drivers today are already being distracted by phones and passangers, not having complete control could help them be safer on the road. I appreciate how the car can move on it's own, but also requires the driver to be somewhat aware of what is going on. Let's face it humans will always be distracted, but not having to actually drive a car might reduce the number of accidents caused by texting. I know it sounds crazy that the driver not paying as well attention, but with the car driving on its own the driver would be able to text and get distracted.

Driveless cars are improving scientific research and inventions. Back to the benefits of the driver just having to be aware, technology has helped so much in the process. The car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Scientist and workers were also able to create a viberating sensor in the seat to help the driver be aware when the car needs assistence such as in a traffic jam. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. The author believes, ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road"". I believe that this would be a great idea and will improve the drivers safety. I know that driving might not be as fun and people will use interest if all they do is sit there, but then they will be able to text and do whatever else they are prevented to do when actually in control of a car.

In conclusion, I believe that driveless cars will actually benefit us later in the future. Its high-tech equitment and special sensors will fascinate people and lead to the purchasing. I believe that allowing product in other states will improve transportation systems and the needs of people. I predict that in the future, there will be other independent vechicles and systems being created. Driveless Cars are coming and we better be ready.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8
9994DE575F03,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" The author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Using the details, I believe that driverless cars could be a good idea. They could malfunction and cause an very bad car accident, they aren't realiable because in some states they arent allowed to test car that run alone, and it would be animosity between the citizens and manufacturers.

First and formost one reason I believe that the car would be an bad idea today is because the makings of the so called ""driverless"" cars could happen to have a glitch in the system and break. For emaple, In the article it states ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical"". This quote states with before making that cars they would have to fix and upgrade things, but they are making these smart cars without doing so. In taking that action the car could stop working whenever which wouldn't be safe for us espically with the major highways and intersections we have on busy streets.

Another reason the driverless cars would not be safe for us, is because you can't depend on them to function properly. In the text it states, ""Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most sates it is illegal even to test computer driven cars, Calidornia, Nevada, Flordia, and the district of columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars"". In this quote it shows that not many states in the U.S. truely believe that these cars are safe itself. You can tell because they don't test the cars and without tests the cars it is no true evidence that they're safe it drive in.

Lastly, I believe the driverless cars aren't safe is because it would cause drama and animosity between the citizens and manufacturers. For example the article quotes "" If the techology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This part of the article shows that when an accident ocurrs with the ""driverless"" cars the court of law, policie officers, or the makers of the model won't know who to put the blame on for the cause. That is a bad idea because also in the text it states, "" Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over"". I took this quote into consideration because it could be an very bad incident and the driver blames the incident on the car but the investigators wouldn't know who to put the blame on. Either the driver becasuse they could have turned the funtion off before the incident happened and they were in control the whole time, or the manufacturers because theu driver may have tried to turn the function off to take control of the car but it malfunctioned which causes it to stop working.

These are my reasons on why to not use driverless cars and keep the nice ones we have. The models that we drive in today work well and may have bad functions, but they are functions that can be fixed in an auto shop. Or the parts of the car can be found in an autopart store.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6
36EB823B246D,"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article about the positives and negatives of driverless cars. It was a very interesting topic, one of the best i've read on an Istep test. It was about how we could be seeing drverless cars in the near future. It talked about how they've tested out many options from magnets to electrical rods. The article gave facts and didn't shy from what the issues were. Now I'm going to express my opinon on the topic.

My view on driverless cars is not a set voice. I agree with their concepts and the test ran but i don't agree with how fast they're trying to market it. It's only been sixteen years since we've gotten computers and only about eight or nine since we got modern computers. The touchscreen phone is fairly new and they have these ""Hoverboards"" which are just segways without handles. I guess what I'm trying to say is there's no reason to jump to something so big if we don't understand what we have yet. I don't doubt we will have self driving cars i just doubt it'll be so soon.

I see self drving cars as something we should pursuit. I just don't think it should be a main part of our advances in technology. There's so many things we can be doing other then creating this. We should finish finding ourselves before we start building technology that doesn't need us. with all this ""machine doing"" stuff we'll just be sitting at home while the bots do everything. Thats no a world i want to live in. A world where everyone looks to machines to do their work.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.2
E4FC29A88EDD,"The idea of a driverless car has always been the goal set for future technology. This is seen in the constant stream of futuristic movies or shows. However, those only convey the positive and idealistic aspects of such vehicles. The ignorance of the negative information associated with them causes a personal disbelief in the cars. Driverless cars should not be developed due to the overwhelming evidence including that development/testing is against the law in the majority of the world due to the idea of possible malfunctions or irresponsible road behavior from the passengers.

A vast majority of people agree that testing should not occur due to possible danger. The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in Paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues.

One contribution to the rejection of testing is the possible malfunctions that could happen. All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to ""take over"". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all of the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Paragraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road.

The manufacturers of the vehicle contradict themselves when it comes to the passengers involved. Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with.

Driverless cars would allow too many flaws in the system and legality issues that prevent them for obtaining the title of a safter option. The manufacturers are attempting to make a car that is easier and requires less effort, but in doing so there is a plethora of issues that accompany it. The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of a ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents. Therefore, there are too many arguments for safety against the vehicles to even consider mass producing them. The driverless cars are much safer on the big screen than in reality.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8
B056CFFBFF3C,"How do driveless cars sound? Driverless cars do sound like a good idea, having them take the wheel for you and not have the hard tasks of revesing when you can not see behind you, parallel parking, and not worrying about the speed you are going when the car can do it for you. The problem I see is that if another driverless car starts on its own and drives away without you, where does it go? Another problem would be that if another driverless car comes into your way and you both crash into each other who do you blame the person driving the car because they were not in control or the manufacturers for not programming the car correctly to avoid collisions like this? What would happen if we did get into an accident? Would we be likely to live or more likely to die because we couldn't control the vehicle?

Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws would be needed in order to cover the liability in case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?

All in all I just think we need to test this one out a little more, because just like smart cars they are not accident proof, they are not safty assured, and they are not likely going to save me or anyone else that would be in the car it would more likely kill us then save us or if we are saved injure us badly.

Not only that but what would the driveless car use regular gas or be an electric car? I already know this as well, but there will be protest about this car working or that this car is just another one of those future cars we are not ready for and so forth, how will we promote this so that people will buy this car knowing it is probably bad for the environment?

2FA2294A94E4,"Driverless cars are becoming popular. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of the driverless car. The negative aspects of the driverless car are stronger than the positvie aspects. Some of the negative aspects of the driverless car consist of: the amount of money/modifications needed, having to stay alert at all times in the passenger seat, and waiting on the law.

In the article, the author asks the reader a question. He asks, ""How much smarter did the cars need to be?"" He answers his own question in the reading. He mentions that the cars needed a whole lot of sensors. They needed sensors for the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. There are many modifications that needed to be made to the cars to make them smarter. Along with the modifications comes with the expense of the equipment. None of that equipment had to be cheap. In this case, The amount of equipment is a negative becasue of how much the cars need.

Another negative is that there always needs to be an alert driver in the passenger seat of the car at all times. In the article, the author says, ""The car can handle driving functions at the speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This makes the driveless car seem less important. Also, the author mentions that the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake on their own but they are designed to notify the driver when the roads require human skills. This means that the driver has to stay alert and be ready to take over when they are needed. Because the car isn't fully driverless, the manufacturers have to make the driving fun in a new way. They have to use heads-up displays that can be turned off when the driver needs to take over.

For the driverless cars to be legal, we have to wait on the law to be passed. Many of the driving laws focus on keeping the drivers, the passengers, and the pedestrians safe. Safety is best achieved with an alert driver. The assumption is that a human driver is the most affective and alert driver. As a result, the only states that allow computer-driven cars to be tested are California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Even though the cars have been proved to be more reliably safe, traffic laws will need to be changed along with liability laws that will need to be established in case of an accident. This reason is a negative one against the development of driverless cars.

Though there are many positive reasons for the development of the driverless car, the negative aspects outrule and over power the positive ones making the driverless car a hassle to develop by the amount of money/modifications needed for the cars, always having to stay alert in the passenger seat, and the wait for the legalization of the driving of the driverless cars.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6

Frist, driverless cars are not completely driverless. In the text it says,''this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.'' If the car isn't completely driverless there is no point on getting a car like this. This car can only handle driving functions up to 25mph. This mean the driver needs to keep hold of the wheels.

Secondly, the driverless car is challenging. It means it's hard to drive. Driverless cars are dangerous. It's not even driverless completely. This type of technology is sometime too advance for people. In the text it says, ''drivers have to steer,accelerate, and brake themselves.'' The driver is doing all the work.

Lastly, the driverless car isn't that advanced. In the text it say,''none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' This car tells you bthe simplest thing. In the text it says,'' it notify the driver when there's a work zone and accident.'' This car isn't really that helpful.

Good thoughts on these driverless cars are, they would use a lot less on gas, you could watch movies and television in your car also. Many people text and drive now days even with self driven cars. If you had a driverless car, you would be able to text and drive. ""These cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" People have bought these cars and not had a crash and [Myself] thinks that it would bea good idea to get one of these driverless cars in my opinion.

Driverless cars have antilock brake systems and driver assistance. Google that has designed these driverless cars have dreamed about making one for the longest time. ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting."" Google wanted to make something that has never been created before. Driverless cars have all kinds of different systems and sensors that we have never thought of building a car with. These cars have ""rotating sensors on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" Driverless cars have so much technology now that they will eventually and some now that will drive themselves.

People that were looking into buying these driverless cars didn't want to be behind the wheel when driving. ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" Why they still need to be behind the wheel is incase of traffic incidents or accidents on the roads for example. Some drivers still think to [Themselves] that they would get bored when not being able to drive and have to wait their turn. Some displays in the driverless cars can be shut off manually. These cars have ""Traffic Jam Assistance,"" which will alert you when driving and when you run into traffic. These cars also have alert systems when driving also. It would be a good and safe choice to purchase one of these driverless cars.

""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars becuase no one needs them anymore?"" Now that we have driverless cars no one would really need the cars that need a driver behind the wheel controlling the wheel, acceleration, and other systems in the car. More and more car manufactures are planning out and creating driverless cars. My position on the driverless cars is that I think that it would be a great idea to purchase one. They are safe, can take you anywhere you would need to go without driving, and would just be a wonderful idea to get one of these driverless cars.    ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6
70B6519712F5,"My opinion on driveless cars are that the are unsafe and not useful in anyway for my perspective.

They say driveless but yet have to be controled once the car realises it can't do a task so turns over to the driver for help.""Google cars aren't truly drivless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in andout of drivways or dealing with complicated traffic issues as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" They say we still need to take controll of a car that is suposavly drivless; how can a car be drivless if it can't even back out or pull in a drive way without having human help(?)

We must remain alert at all times while driving,'They can steer,accelerate,and brake themselves,but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills,such as navagating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situatin requires."" so why would we have a self driving car when we can just be alert on our own and drive our selfs. If we have self driving cars people aregonna think its ok to just go to sleep or something stupid as texting. The car is going and your texting it alerts you to take over but you dont know becuase your not paying attention. So their for self driving cars can be more hazerdous (in my case).It is best for you to pay attention full time not just when situations get tough.

I beleive the car is unsafe and not cappible of living up to its full name yes it can do certant things but not fully go on its own; it is unsafe and illegal in countrys. ""manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe."" So from my perspective the car isnt as safe as people think.

The technology may not work as certaint times so their for it may cause accidents without giving you any warnings. Whos fault would it be if a accident happend?""If the technology fals and someone is ijured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture?"" I believe it would be the manufacturers fault because they biult and places the technology in the car but yet still had an accident happen.

MY resons to why i thinmk the ""driveless"" car is a bad idea may cause technology problems,whont drive on its own(fully),may cause people to fully not pay attention to the road, and we must be alert at all time reguardless if you are gonna cause an accident or if th person next to you dose so you can take a faster reaction.

7F77FE73B338,"If you could have a driverless car would you take the chance? Driverless cars should not be developed. I think this because of the cars not actually being driverless, companies not knowing how to make it enticing, and laws preventing it. If you saw a driverless car on the road, would you feel safe? Would you know if the human inside is or isn't driving?

Driverless cars aren't actually driverless. While they can do many raod behaviors without the help of a driver, they actually are not driverless. When they encounter something such as a traffic jam, or the ever so challenging driveway, they must alert the driver to take over. It even states in the paragraph that, ""Google cars aren't truly driverless."" This is argued however, as it does state in the passage that advancements are being made. These advancements are predicted to creat a real driverless car by 2020. This can also be a problem however, as many companies claiming to have made these cars are wanting to release them before this time, showing that this prediction doesn't matter to them. They could care less if the car is actually driverless, they just want money. If you encountered a driverless car while driving, would you trust that that car is safe?

Manufacturers don't know how to make this technology enticing. After all, what fun is there in being in a driverless car. Many people nowadays have their cars for the purpose of driving them, not riding. They enjoy driving, and get the biggest, fastest, or toughest car they can. This is from a love of cars. Introducing driverless cars would ruin this love and passion for cars. You wouldn't see anymore interesting races, as they would be driven by cars that were automated, and already knew which car would win, they just were running a program to make it interesting. This can be argued, however, as supporters of this say that cars that need drivers would never be removed, and races will stay the same as it always has been. They allso can argue, from the passage, that,""Some manufacturers hope to do that (make driverless cars fun) by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" When you think of a driverless car, do you think of a powerful engine roaring to life, a slick racecar speeding down a track, or do you just see something like an electric car, small motor, and not exciting?

Laws prevent these cars from even being researched. The passage even states that,""in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" manufacturers only hope is that they, ""believe that more states (other thatn California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Colombia) will follow (allowing cars to be tested) as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. However, even if this doesn't happen, there is another problem. The passage states, ""even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" This shows that the legal and manufacturing worlds are completely unprepared for driverless cars. If you were to want to buy a driverless car, how much would you think about the laws covering it? Would they be in your favor if anything happens, or would they be complicated enough that the manufacturer themselves can just blow you off?

Driverless cars should not be developed. I believe this because, the cars aren't actually driverless, the manufacturers don't know how to make them enticing, and laws prevent them from even happening. When you really think about driverless cars and their existance, doesn't it seem like common sense to not have have something that can cause such troubles for our world?

0A5E01EBAC52,"Have you ever driven a car? If so, were you actually driving or was this car a driverless car? Many people are preferring to ride in driverless cars or semi driverless cars. Without your eyes on the road, how can driverless cars be safe? The Author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" gives examples of how driverless cars can result in being late, more expensive, and more acciddents.

In the story "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph three, states many companies that have started making these driverless cars. One being General Motors, whose idea was towards ""Smart Roads"". Having smart roads would be rediculous becuase of the expensises in using magnets and the special car sensor needed. If we had smart raods, and the road broke, what would we do? Basing all of our driving on a ""Smart Road"" would increase the risk of it breaking and everyone being late.

Okay, so smart raods are a terrible idea. What about smart cars? Google came out with a Toyota Prius. The prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a roatating senor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automatic radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. Sounds cool right? There are a couple problems with all of this stuff on a car. The first problem being that if one thing broke it would be super expensive. the second problem being if one thing broke nobodywould be able to drive at all. The last problem with all of the gudgets on the car is having the extra weight on the car would make the gas milage go through the roof.

So, smart roads and smart cars are starting to sound like a bad idea. Still can not make up your mind? Take the human mind as a consideration. These smart cars would make humans lazy. If we had these driverless cars we would not pay any attention to whats going on on the road. In the story ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph eight reads "" some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. Think about what would happen if a car had a malfunction, would the other riders in the driverless cars be paying attention? Think about if a kid ran in the street after thier ball, would the car or the driver know? Finally, think about how much boring the world would be if you only rode in the car not drove it? Would you see the the beautiful blue sky or the amazing adventure of the forest? No, you wpould not. The little things are what make driving such a privledge not a right.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. As people, we should always look ahead at what is in front of us. In ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author states both good and bad ideas of the driverless cars, I encourge you to think about the little things and the bad thing, on why we should not allow driverless cars.

AC492212391A,"Driverless cars are coming. Driverless cars would be a great thing to do because there would be way less crashes. Sensors can stop the car when in danger. The sensors can also reduce the amount of power from the engine. Position estimating sensor on left rear wheel stops the car when backing up almost into asomething you cant see. Another thing that the sensors could do is make sure the driver has hands on the wheel.

The good in these driverless cars is that there would be less lives at risk. There would definatley be less crashes in the united states. Another thing driverless cars can do is save lives on the road and off the road as a pedestrian. The last thing that driverless cars are good is when your in bad traffic the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but the sensors make sure hands are on the wheel.

The bad in the driverless cars is that the driver dont want to wait fot their turn to drive. Dr. Werner Huber said that we have to interpret the driving in a new way. In some states they wont allow to test these smart cars except, california, nevada, florida, and district of columbia they have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomonous cars.

My standpoint on the driverless cars is that I am against them. Not only are they dangerous, but they can also be deadly. they can easly crash, they can put people out of jobs, and they would also take a lot of money to build firstly, the driverless cars can easly crash. If the driver is not paying attention, the car would not be able to navigate by itself, therefore causing a possible accident. The driverless car is still technically not a driverless car, it still needs human help, like backing out of driveways, navigating in difficult traffic construction, and also navigating through roadwork. if the driver is not alert, then the cr would not be able to turn itself.

secondly, they would put millions of taxy driver and other people out of work. if the problems are worked out of the car, them they will soon be on the road. the taxi services and other car makers will soon be out of work because then would the people of the usa want to drive themselfs around when they could just sit back and relax while the car does all the work.

thirdly, they will be a lot of money to build. Just to build one of them would cost millions and millions of dollers. this would then put the economy at risk because it is being taken out of state taxes. this would cause the government to start taxing everything to help get the taxes back up. with all of the sensors and technology put into the driverless car, nobody would be able to buy it, maybe millionairs.

FCB9D3E12BAF,"My position on driverless cars are that its a good idea. I think its good idea beccause it will cut down on fuel, not as many deaths because the people won't be driving it, it will be more comfortable and flexable. Driverless cars are a good idea to stay safe and get to somewhere more efficient, better than a taxi.

To have driverless cars mean that they could cut down on fuel. In the text it says that one of their cars used half of what taxi cars use right now. They will not have to deal with deaths because the driver is not driving. In the passage it shows that the car ddrove half of a million miles and did not crash once. Many of accidents today are because of people that are drunk driving, but because of the driverless cars there wont be as manny deaths as there is right now.

Other ideas are that people are not comfortable in the car. They could finally be comfortable in the car because they dont have to drive. Just think of this you can sleep in the car and no accidents could happen. You could get to places farther in a more efficient time.

Therefore, I think having driverless cars are a good thing to look forward in the future. You could have no more pollution and no more crashes and deaths.

Some people might just say they are good for the future without knowing the consequences for any possible accidents.

One reason why these cars would not be good woukd be if there is an old person that can not drive they could consider one of these cars. The problem is that if it is time for the driver to take over the car and if the driver does not know how to drive, this would lead to a problem. Accidents could occur if non drivers are in the car. It could lead to a critical stage of punishment in case you are in a fatal crash or get stopped by the police.

My other argument is that these cars could potentially stop working if they do not have proper items for this car.

Most people arent going to have the right things for this car, if they crash the car might not function the same and proper way of how its supposed to work. This car could break down for no reason.

Maybe it is simply because there was a system malfunction with the car, or it could be because when the car tells the driver to take back over the driver is not paying attention. Someone will get injured, and it is not worth it.

Driverless cars are not completely driverless. Whether it is because the driver has to keep their hand on the wheel when the car is driving its self, or because the car will ask the driver to take over when it approaches a sticky situation. Yes, drivers do get tired of driving, but what's the point of having a driverless car if you still have to drive anyway? It's a waste of time and money. In paragraph nine, the author states that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Therefore, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars.

As we all know It's 2016 and we're only moving further and further into technology. Driverless cars are only the next big thing and they're being noticed more and more everyday. All these manufacturers and car companies are trying to come up with the safest driveless cars as possible and that's just what they're doing. Do you think the first car invented had all these gadgets we have now? No, they had no gps, airbags, or these car sensors we have now, but we grew in technology and made them more safe.

The biggest thing that's stopping driverless cars from being on the streets in my opinion is safety. Nobody has saw driverless cars on the street, so we don't know how to react to something so new. Driverless cars would have all of these sensors that will keep the car from crashing or breaking speed limits. These driveless cars are only mimicing a human at the wheel, but these signals and sensors are way safer then a humans senses and signals.

When driverless cars were first being thought of it was in the 1950's. It was a lot more technical and difficult to do back then, because they didn't have all the major technology we do in todays time. At first they thought of putting special tracks in the roads but realized it would need a lot of money to complete that project.

In this car you have to have your hands on the wheel, the cars themselves are fully driverless but they can; steer, accelerate, and break them selves. The cars are specailly made and will notify the driver when they need to take control of the driving, in situations such as navigating around accidents and work zones.

There can be a bit of trouble when it comes to the laws of Driverless cars. It is illegal to test a computer opperated vehical in; California, Nevada, florida, and in the District of Colombia.

They did state that the driver should always have his/her eye on the road but, they were also talking about getting ""in-car entertainment"".

Danger is a big worry to the world, understandably to because many people die in automotive accidents. Some beleive that driverless cars can solve that danger involved in driving. But in truth it could be more dangerous than a human driving.

Although some people might enjoy being shoufered around by their own automobile, is it really safe? Smart cars are controlled by computer systems and sensors through out the car, and other pieces of technology including video cameras, and GPS, but everything including techonlogy has its faults. The article even includes information stating that even driverless cars still need drivers. Their are many what if's in the article, one being ""What If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault, the driver or the manufactuer?"" As a result, in most states it is illegal.

People would not only have to worry about making sure their car doesnt malfunction but also worrying about who would be held reliable for faulty technology in and on their car. It states in paragraph 9 ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" Even with the newsest technology put in these smart cars, it cannot prevent a driver from being in an accident if the driver themselves is not aware and paying attention to the car alerts.

It states in paragraph 2 ""Google cars arent truly driverless, they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" In paragraph 9 it states ""The only safe car has a human driver in control at all time."" If so far all smart cars have had to require a driver then their is no true driverless car. With that being said and providing support from the article what is a driverless car?

That's a good question too because the driver wasn't expecting for the technology to fail, but the driver should have been ready anyways.

I enjoy the things that current smart cars do like stopping for you because it can sense the environment, but if we rely on smart cars too much it can be a problem. For example if we would rely on smart cars too often there are chances where we expect a certain thing that the car can do for our safety, but it ends up malfunctioning and causing an accident that could be deadly. I think we should stick with driverless features, but not rely on them because you always need to be ready just in case they do malfunction. It can be very deadly if you completely rely on your driverless car.

I agree with parargraph eight in it's explanation of texting and driving because many people text and there are many accidents every year due to texting and driving. In the paragraph the text states that, ""Such displays can be turned off intantly when the driver needs to take over---something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.""

I find this to be very helpful for someone who texts and drives, it could possibly lower accidents caused by texting and driving. It could be very helpful to people with emergencies too where they have to respond immediately to a message, but they're driving, if they have a smart car they can let it take over for a small moment to answer the text message.

I'm going to refer back to paragraph nine again about laws being affected by driverless cars. In paragraph nine it states, ""Presently, traffic laws are written wih the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars.""

New laws will have to be made in order to make driverless cars legal and tht could be a problem because of all the work that is put into creating laws anyways. It could cause a confusing mess with the law system and driver's license tests would have to be remade to fit the requirement of driverless cars. Safety laws would also be affected because of the malfunctions that could happen with driverless cars as I talked about above.

As I said before, I agree with driverless cars to an extent. There can be positive effects of driverless cars, but there can also be negative effects too. I feel that we need the option to have a driverless car, but still rely on yourself to drive it and only use the driverlees option when necessary.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.6
FEB736959AD7,"Driverless cares are the future. They are going to be great! With driverless cars we have to worry less about our safety and everyone else's safety.

Safety is always key, and these cars are safe. In this articule it states, ""In reality, Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have riven more than half a million miles without a crash"" (Paragraph 2). These, driverless cars, have been proven to be safe. There are many people who have not had wrecks before, so yeah, those people are safe drivers. But, there are also people who have had one or multiple wrecks, and all of them may not be there fault but they still have been in a wreck. The driverless cars Google has been testing have not had a wreck yet! The though of driverless cars taking over the world and us not having to worry about losing anyone to a car wreck ever again is amazing.

Another good attribute about driverless cars is that they follow the rules. The cars do not speed, or run red lights, or not stop at stopsigns, they follow the rules. Some of those rules are also leading cause of wrecks; people who are driving out of control way over the speeding limit, or someone running a red light in a rush and they pull out in front of someone and cause and accident, also if they just do not think they have to stop at a stop sign and someone going the other way does not have to stop or they already did stop and it was their turn to go. Also, the number one and two things that get most people in wrecks, texting and drinking. People do not have to worry about a driverless care texting someone back or on the phone looking at social media. Driverless cares do not get distracted. People also will not see a driverless car in a bar getting drunk. It just will not happen. The driverless cars will not be pulled over for being intoxicated or swerving because they will not be intoxicated and will be driving safely.

Now some people are going to argue and say, ""These really aren't driverless cars, you still have to drive them."" Yes, they are true, as of now. But people should be fine with having to take the wheel sometimes. The text states, ""Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents"" (Paragraph 2). and it also says, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" (Paragraph 7). So they are correct when they say they are not truly driverless. But for now that is the technology we have we should accept it, and who would not want to feel as if they were in control during situations such as a wreck, or a work zone. And it we all ended up having driverless cares we would not have to worry about us having to take over the car through a wreck zone because these cars do not wreck.

The one downside is that the next generation of kids will never get to really learn how to drive. That's most peoples favorite thing to do when they get to the age to drive. They all want to go out to their car and take it for a spin. The next generation will not have to learn with driverless cars. Now, since they do not know any better because they will not see their parents driving, they may not miss it as much, but they will be missing out on a privelage it has been for many generations of people all across the world. But on the other side as parents, we will be glad to know that we will not ever have to worry about our kids being in a wreck or dying in a wreck, and we will always know they will safely make it to where they are going.

The future is coming and everyone needs to be ready! Driverless cars are a great things to come to this planet and everyone should be excited. Safety has always been something everyone in this whole world wants, and with driverless cars, we get that.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8
D0098F968204,"My position to driverless cars is on the negative side. The reason i say negative is that i know nothing about it and it just doesnt seem safe to let a car, something with no brain, something that cant even think for itself drivea car for you. Technology is driving the car for you but wouldnt people get nervous because they dont know if the technolody would stop working or not thats kinda scarey. But i will explain why i am more on the negative side.

I think smart cars is a really good idea but i dont think its a good i dea to not drive the car and let the car drive itself. What happens if the car runs out of fuel or stops workin all of a sudden what are you supposed to do because alot of people know absolutely nothing about technology or even cars. What if the technology starst going out of control and theres no way to stop it, things can get really bad for the passenger and the company the car came from. They said in a driverless car some thing that is not available is texting while the car is driving, if the car is driverless it should be able to handle itself thats why it says driverless. They also said its 90% driver less so basically the car can run on its own for a long period of time without the drivers assistants and they never explained how far the car can go, the distance of the car can travel. They also didnt explain how many years the car can last without it causing any problems. In the passage said automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved but what about the near future what if the problems accur again how would you solve them ?

Smart cars isnt a bad thing but i dont think their safe and thats just my opinion. I dont think its safe for people to drive in an autopilot car and have no worries at all. I wonder if the cars stop working how many people are going to be without transportation or how many people are going to be broke just because they spent every last dollar into a car they knew nothing about, it was jsut interesting to them. I wonder how many people would think about their choice then. But in the end people are still going to but these cars.

43E4FF80D03C,"""The car of tomorow"", "" The future in automotive is here"". We have all heard and or read these these sales slogans before. Wether in medicine,computers, or even cars; the technology of today is shaping tomorow. Of thoes changes the most profund one is the change in cars. So are they worth it?

The use of driverless cars is a wonderful idea. They offer a special saftey that wasn't their before. If you hate driving threw big citys or even at night driverless cars are the way to go. They offer an economic advantage as they "" would use half the fuel of todays taxis."", as Google cofounder Sergey Brin states.

As we notice all the good in a driverless car we tend not to notice the bad. the disadvatages to the driverless car are many. Many people see this driverless idea as a good thing but how many of thoes people will be able to afford this new technology? As with all new technology it's going to be expensive to buy, and it could also be expensive to replace and have fixed. Manufacturers will also tend to look more at the profet and diveate from the qualty of their products. This problem can be the bigest that stops the cars from being released. As qualty goes down parts will tend to break. When a part breaks the coustmer will go to have it fixed or replaced, but this can be an issue. Since it is a new technology not alot of people will know how to replace a certian part that is broken. That means that Their will be a backup of cars needing to be fixed.

Another problem is in a driving senerio. What if your driving and another car with a person driving runs the stop light? The driverless car would'nt know to look right of left, it would just drive straight threw the intersection. If that was a human driving they would know to wait a second or to before driving off from the green light. This little detal can hurt or harm alot of people.

A flase advertisement could also harm alot of people after buying a driverless car. As the artical states the human interaction in driverless cars is needed. Some cars even ""notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill"". That means that the car isn't allways self driving. As we saw in the case of the lady who put her RV in auto steer, took a nap, then the RV wrecked, false atvertisement is a crutial part of the cars sucess. Many people who buy a driverless car if they can afford one probally think it's all automated and will sleep or play around in the car. They could also not wear seat belts as these cars are advertised as safer than tratitional cars. The artical states that "" the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""

Theirfore after facts and opinions are stated a driverless car isn't worth it. Yes, it is true that it can save the enviroment a little but you have to think whats more inportant your life or the enviroment. As people strech the truth about these cars other people will start to buy them causing allot of suffering on thier part.

03755AB0A62C,"It is hard to imagine a world without cars being controlled without humans. Cars have been a mandatory factor in most of our everyday lives. If we as humans decide to cut out the human factor to driving, there are consequences. Consequences such as the threat of saftey, the lost jobs surrounded around vehicles, and the overall question; are self-driving cars nessecary?

Not very long ago, I like many before me, got my liscense at the age of sixteen. That day will forever linger in my mind everytime I put the keys in the ignition. As a young driver, my saftey is always a concern. I learned the true aspects of saftey in my drivers education course, and saftey has been stuck in my mind since. If we create a world where us as humans are no longer in control of saftey, are we not creating an unsafe world? I am expected to put my life in the hands of some machine, rather than putting life in my own hands.

Several years ago, the auto industry was a major factor for income for most people. The jobs surrounded by cars have always been imparative for humans. Then, machines took over the jobs humans had lived off of. Making the auto industry more efficient, but leaving many without jobs. Now we are faced with a similar situation, where the driverless cars take jobs from people who live off of driving.

The auto industry has been relatively the same over the past few years. Cars have become safer, faster, and all around more productive. Now comes the change of a lifetime, the change nobody really needed. Sure, self-driving cars make life easier for everyday life. But, sometimes we need to take a few steps back and remember; how far is too far? The auto industry does not require this change.

Negativity is all that comes from this change. The auto industry will not benefit from these self-driving cars. They will create lawsuits and disaster. These driverless abominations will make the living jobless. This audacious movement will create an unneed and irrational situation for us, the people.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4

If we invented driverless cars it would become a problem. ""In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.""

The roads are already unsafe. People are already reckless drivers and don't follow the rules or pay attention to the roads. If we were to get driverless cars, do you think people would more careful? Cars have sensors, cameras ,GPS etc. already built into cars. Why do we need cars that can drive by themselves? It is unnessisary for us to drive driverless cars.

Driverless cars could harm other people on the roads. If a car is incontrol, a human will not be able to stop it.

6770F94889E2,"Ever thought of a car that drives itself? Seems pretty crazy right? Its been shown in movies and televison and it seems pretty impossible. In reality, people are actually trying to make it happen, there has been proto types of cars that are mostly driveless and testing of many kinds. Whether it happens or not, theres a weighing question of is it a good idea? It is a bad idea, they should not make cars driveless because it cost a lot, may not even ever work, and its dangerous.

Money is a huge factor to this type of technology, can you imagine the cost of developing thousands and millions of cars that have such an advanced technology to be able to drive, brake, get to a destination all by itself? Its pretty expensive to even to make a proto type or test run these so called ""Diverless Cars"". If a car like such is created how would the world be changed? Not only would the car itself be expensive to create but theres more factors to just creating the cars, its how the cars themslef work. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author tells about some proto types or car similar to the ""Driverless car"" image. The authors gives an example about cars that uses sensors or radio signals that are telling the cars what to do. That means, the roads would have to give off certain signals that contribute to the car itself, the roads and lights would also have to have signals and sensors. It would cost tons of money to do things such as rebulid roads or lights so cars like these would properly worl.

The car that drives themself may never actually be a thing, there is so much to it. The cars may never truly be driveless, technology cannot do everything humans do. There is always going to be times an actual driver may need to come in. Things such as, traffic or crashes or roadwork and there is no way of telling if driverless cars may be able to adapt to that. Not only is adapting a problem but is our technology advanced enough to have driverless cars? We as a society are advanced in the technology area but is it advanced enough to develop cars that are able to know where to go or what to do just like humans are? Technology things do not think like humans, they don't think at all, they have to be programed a certain way and there is always surprises or certain situations that these cars would not be able to do it properly or safely.

Safety. This is quite the biggest concern with a product such as a driverless car. How can you insure that these cars are 100% safe? The cars technology may run into a problem later on that it, itself is not advanced enough to know exactly what to do so it may cause a person danger. The whole car is made of technology and we can not rely on it, things happens, technology may not always work. There has to be certain signals or things such as a battery life, or the technology may just fail altogether. If someone was to be in a driveless car and the system in the car or the technology were to crash was stops the car from doing the same? If the technology messes up and the car doesn't know when to stop it could cause a crash. Technology can never be completely relied on, until it can, there will always be safety issues or concerns and thats enough not to make something that could be very dangerous to someones life.

Driverless cars seem like a huge thing, people are trying to create this dream. People are taking steps to make cars that are so advanced they can drive themselves, but that shouldn't be a thing because of the cost, we are not that advanced in our lifetime, and its a patenually dangerous idea.

2F9499C7A36E,"I believe that Driverless cars are going to be a very important nessesity to the development and transition of transportaion technology. Transportation will change from getting to places by using your own brain, to getting to places without having to really think about what you are doing while you are going somewhere.

I feel that diverless cars will not only help with safety of people while they are on the road, but also benifit people by being able to get to places faster and get more things done in the day while driving to a destination.

First off, driverless cars will be the safest way to travel from place to place.

This is becuase of all of the safety features that are equipted in driverless cars.

They contain a numerous amount of sensors and alert systems. If there was something that would harm you while in the driverless car, the car would either be able to get out of the situation more effectively than an experienced driver, or would be able to alert the driver to take over and the driver would manually get out of the situation.

In the passage it says that the Google driverless cars contain many sensors. Some of those sensors include, the sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor.

This shows first hand how safe the driverless cars are. The Driverless cars have so many built in sensors that even the most dangerous situation can be avoided while in a driverless car.

Next, if everyone owns or uses a driverless car to get to the places it needs to go, then the car can program itself to get to the place that it needs to go as efficiently and in the best route possible.

This is so that the passengers and driver can get to the destination as quickly as possible.

At some point, if the only cars that are used are driverless cars, and laws in all states, not just California, Nevada, Florida, and Washington D.C. have caught up with the driverless cars , then the cars will be able to move quicker and safer to the destinations that are programed into the car.

The more driverless cars on the road, the faster the destination can be acheived.

Lastly, if you use a driverless car to go to the places you need to go to in the day, you will be able to get a multitude of things done that you were not able to get done before.

Car companies like BMV are trying to come up with things that they can add to the car to have things to do while driving to a specific location.

If you have emails that need to be sent or a presentation that needs to be made, you can easily accomplish thoses tasks while ""driving"" the driverless car.

If at any point in time the car will give you a notification that you need to take over driving for a period of time, then all you have to do is stop your work for a short period of time to manually drive the car.

After that then you can get back to what you were working on before. This will allow you to get more things done in the day that were not possible before.

In conclusion, I think that driverless cars are the milestone of the future, and that they are going to help to expand the horizons of multitasking, stafety, and speed to destinations.

Driverless cars are the gateway to the future and will really help the world as a whole to keep moving and to bring more great things like the driverless car in the future.

I say this because in the article the author talks about how google have had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 and they haven't crashed. This shows how safe the driverless cars are. If these cars were on the road over normal cars they would prevent the driver error accidents, in turn minimizing the amount of accidents.

What came to mind is that i think driverless cars are gonna be a trajedy, instead of being the next best thing.

I start to see that when driverless cars come out everyones going to want them, but whats the price with this? I and i'm sure many other people think would we even need a lisence for this car and is it going to be safe as it sounds?

If your not driving it then you should have it its really a waste of money if you buy it. Driveless cars are a bad idea and there not safe.

First of all they can cause a wreck and as it said in the article if somebody gets into a wreck who can they blame it on. The driver, or the car who knows who acually did it. And what if its the cars fault what if it catchs a glicth or something. What if the car has a glicth and blows up who's fault is that the person who made it right??? Who's gonna pay for the persons funneral if they so happen to die.

No one knows you see regular cars dont catch glitch. Regular cars dont drive there selfs because the person behind the wheel drives the car not the other way around. Thats the whole point of them making a car is for transportation but what is the point of having a machine drive you around and thats the whole point of you buyin it. Is for you to have fun driving it if you make driveless cars then teenagers are going to think that they dont need a license to drive a car.

In todays society people rely on technology for directions, phone numbers, social media, and sometimes even for school projects. This has led to people using less phone books, maps, books, and even less people meeting in public. This is why we shouldnt rely on technology; which leads to diverless cars. It could lead to unsafe relying on everything.

Driverless cars are not safe ideas. There are many things that could go wrong while using one. The cost of one could be to much. They would only cause more trouble and accidents on the road. Many places would not allow them. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.2
8AA34A4C8BEA,"Imagine you are riding in a driverless car and you see a bright red car heading toward you. Would you panic? Or would you go on as if nothing was going to happen? Imagine having very little control of your car when it crashes into the red car that was coming towards you. Imagine finding out that you had just killed two precious, little babies lives because your driverless car lost control. These are the things that you have to think about when it comes to driverless cars. I believe that diverless cars are not completely safe. I think they should be illegal for many reasons.

Vehicles have mechanical problems all the time. You will be driving down the road and your breaks will go out, or your steering wheel will lock up. These things are hard enough to control when the driver is in control of the car, let alone if the driver was not fully in control. In section seven, it says that the driverless cars are able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. What happens when you are riding along and something goes completely wrong and you end up crashing into the car that was heading your way? Driverless cars would only exacerbate the mechanical problems cars have today. In section nine it says that if the car fails, and someone is injured, who is responsible? The driver or the manufacturer?

Safety is a big issue when it comes to driving. One of the main issues is texting and driving. If you are the designated ""driver"" in a driverless car, you would be even more tempted to get on your phone. I believe that this is not safe at all. If you are in the drivers seat, you need to be paying attention to the road at all times, even in a driverless car. In section eight in the passage, it says that some maufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. I think that having these ammentities in the car are very unsafe. Even though the cars have been tested and have been driven more than a half a million miles without crashing according to section two, there are still possibilities for mishaps and crashes. Because of this, section nine says that in most states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars.

Safety is not the only issue when it comes to driverless cars. Owning a driverless car would be extremely expensive. As I said earlier, mechanical failuers happen all the time in cars today. The cost to fix your car when something happens is already expenxive. If you were to own a driverless car and something happened to fail, the cost would most likely be exorbitant. Driverless cars have so many features and sensors. In section four, it says that there are sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. If one of these sensors were to go bad or to break, it would be costly to fix them.

Overall, I thik that driverless cars should not be legal. They put too many things and people at risk. Even though they have been tested and proven to be safe, there are still many things that could go wrong. In section seven, it says that they are able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. If you believe these things to be true and you get in the car without a care in the world, you will not be filled with much exhilaration when something goes wrong. The issue of driverless cars and safety is a big problem to me. When you are in a car that you do not have to pay attention to the road very much, you could be doing whatever you wanted. Even if you were paying attention to the road and your surroundings, you never know what other drivers are doing. Not being in control of the car can be very dangerous no matter what situation you are in. ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8
45AEF7ACA470,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like if humans didn't have to control the car? I think driveless cars is a good idea but at some time humans will have to take over. I say this because it would be less acidents, there will be less tickets , and people without lisences can't drive.

One reason why I think it's a good idea is because it will be less acidents. The computer will know what to do in different situations. And i think they should have a monitor on when the computer drives and when the person drives. At what place and what time. Then you will know who to blame for any acidents.

Another reason why i think it's a good idea is because there will be less tickets. If the car knows what speed limit to go or when to stop then there would be no problem with running past lights and stop signs. And you can't lie about it was the computer because it follows the rules , and they have it monitered on the car.

My last reason is because there is a lot of people out there that doesn't have a lisents and they are still driving. If you have to show your lisents or put it into somewhere so the computer knows you are allowed to drive than there wouldn't be a problem.

There are so many good reasons why you should have drivless cars. But theses are my 3 reasons why i think we should have them.   ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.4

Well many car companies are working on driverless cars for the public. This technology although imperfect at the moment has been around for years. It stated in a article that, ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" However, driverless cars are dangerous and should be banned because they are not completely driverless, legal issues if there was a car crash, and the technology is still too insufficent to be trusted.

First, the ""driverless"" cars are not completely driverless. For example in an article it stated, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" With this information we can see that ""driverless"" cars are still not completely driverless. This can make it dangerous if the driver is not paying attention, when attention is needed. This could be fatal if the driver failed to get to the steering wheel in time.

Secondly, the legal issues that would be created by this new form of car would be catastrofical numbers of laww suits. The question of who would be responsible is a difficult one. In the text it stated, ""...if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This question does raise a lot of legal issues. Many states in fact have already banned this car. It stated in the text, "" As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars, California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Coloumbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autononomous cars..."" As you see many states have banned these self driving machines, obiously for good resons, because of all the law suits, legal issues, and because they are dangerous.

Finally, The technology is still too insufficent to be trusted with the lives of innocent people. When the technology is still not fully tested, and can't full keep passengers safe then they shouldnt be trusted. In the text it stated, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This shows how insufficent the technology is today. If the technology can't drive the car by its self, then it shouldn't be trusted, because drivers are distracted as it is. So these self driving cars would almost never need human assistance, and the moment they did drivers would be so distracted they would not be able to react in time.

In conclusion, these dangerous driverless cars should be banned because they are not completely driverless, legal issues if there was a crash, and the technology is still to insufficent to be trusted. Maybe in the future with more advances in technology these cars could be trusted. The legal issues would cease if the cars were certified they were safe. So maybe, in the far future we can trust cars that are completely diverless with our lives, but at the moment driverless cars should be banned.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8
0ACFCCD6649F,"We all need to have a break right? Well,now Google wants to create a driverless car in the future. In this argumentative essay I will talk about how we should have driverless cars in the future and how beneficial it can be.

I think that driverless cars are better and they should be allowed because some people drive from twelve hours to there destination and even thirty-two hours from their destination. I would say it is a good idea because some familys take road trips and the driver is usually very tired after hours of driving in the same position. According to paragraph one,Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that such cars would fundementally change the world,and personally,it could change my dads world. Also,we need driverless cars becuase some people drive at night and their sight and brain can be unconscious and have a wreck. Driving at night can be and will be very exhausting,but if you are too tired to even pay attention to the road,the best thing to do is to lay down in your car and let the car do its own thing.

Another reason I think it should be allowed is because of all the reckless driving there is in this world. Of course,according to paragraph seven,Google didnt extend the possibilites of having a successful driverless car. They just made the driverless car not really driverless. I mean,in paragraph seven it states clearly that the car will have a sensor in order for the passenger in the drivers seat to take action whenever there is an accident or upcoming traffic. In someway it sounds helpful but in another way it just sounds as if the driver is still driving no matter what. They should create driverless cars becuase some people have accidents and can result in death. So,to avoid that we need those driverless cars,we need something that can be useful for people who are seniors and when they are drunk or are just learning to drive. Also,we do need it for the people who take road trips or the people who have business trips and just have to drive for hours.

My third reason on which we should have driverless cars is that we might want to see and enjoy the view of the outside. The passangers are not a problem when coming to viewing the outside world through their window,but the passanger will get exhausted just looking straight infront of him. We need to think that the driver also wants a little taste of what is out there to see. Like my mom,she likes to see out in the window but she cant because she has to keep her focus infront of her. Our brain can also go to a point where it can get exhausted and they eyesight fails some of the time it fails and the accidents happen.

In conclusion,we should have driverless cars because they will be useful for all of us,especially the ones who have to drive for hours just to get to their destination. It will also be helpful for the people who drive at night. Some people cant even see at night and they just crash. So,I think that we should have driverless cars because it will be beneficial for all of us.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent,0.8
