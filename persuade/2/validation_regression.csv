You can explore new places while helping countries recover from the war. You can make it like a family vacation and have your whole family help. You can spend time with them.

When I joined the program i was excited to explore and help countries. I was on a trip to Greece and before we arrived I was 18 years old. That means i was old enough to get recruited. My draft board figured out I was on a cattle-boat trip they told me to stay there and keep helping. I was excited to keep doing what I love. I was discharged in 1947. In that time i made nine trips. Thats the most of any seagoing cowboy. I saw many countries like Europe and China. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece. That was special to me. On rides home the crew would play baseball or volleyball on board and many more games. I'm very grateful for this opportunity. It has opened up the world to me! That was the best experience of my life. You should really try it out. I bet you would love it.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent,0.2

88DB81B8AFF1,"The reason we want you to be in our program is that..Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change vey soon, when Don Reist (Luke's friend) said that he was invited to go with him in Europe in a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so, he went with him for an opportunity of a life time.

In 1945, World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. 44 nation joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitatiion Administration ). After that the UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young farm animals that were shipped overseas. When luke turned 18 years old right before he arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. In 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy was ever been through.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a smal- town boy, Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luke also found time to have fun on board, esspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played music, played games, sports they played, and also read to have some relaxation.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy for Luke was much more an adventure for him it also gaved him much more experience to the world than he imagined. It made Luke more aware of peole of other countries their needs. and that awareness stayed ith him, leading his family to host a number of international student and exchanged visitors for many years.

BF0C6EA61BEC,"Man, I enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy. I got to help so many people! You should sign up! The purpose of Seagoing Cowboys was to help countries that have suffered from WW2, such as Greece and China. It was created by UNRRA, and was very helpful to all critical European countries.

A few reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because we bring horses, cows, and muless to countries in need and we also take care of these animals. You also have some time for sightseeing. However, there is some danger of signing up. Seeing as you´re on a boat most of the time with hundreds of animals, you have limited space, and then you have the dangers of the sea. When I say dangers of the sea I mean things like drowning, storms, et cetera.

Now, I want to tell you about how I got into Seagoing Cowboys, and my story of being one. It was 1945. I had two part-time jobs at the time, and my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to join him in going to Europe on a cattle boat. World War 2 had just finished, and lots of European countries were in a critical state. 44 nations joined to make the UNRRA, and they hired people to take care of cattle that were being shipped. Don and I both signed up.

In August, we were told to go to New Orleans for our job. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, a cattle boat with more than 300 horses. I was discharged in 1947, and I had made history. I made 9 trips, which is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It was impressive, seeing as I couldn´t work for a few days due to broken ribs. I was so proud of myself, and it was definitely more than a job, it was a way to help me be more aware of others´ needs.

Well, I have to go back to my job at the supermarket. I recently was rehired and got my position back in the meat department. Now, isn that ironic? Remember, if you have the chance to be a Seagoing Cowboy, take it! It´ll open up so many parts of the world to you. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent,0.4

""My first reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to see places and things you never thought you would get to see."" This claim can be found in paragraph five of ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" when it mentions the places and things Luke saw such as Acropolis in Greece and an excavated castle in Crete.

""Another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to help people in other countries that were affected by World War II. Some countries were left in ruins and need help to recover food and supplies."" This claim can be found in paragraph two of ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.""

""I have also had lots of fun with the other coyboys. We played games such as baseball and volleyball. We have also had fencing and boxing tournaments."" This claim is found in paragraph eight of ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""

E2BA301A62EE,"Some people think being a Seagoing Cowboy is boring but I can tell you that they are wrong. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a amazing opportunity for everyone because you can travel around the world. You can see countries like Greece, China, and other countries. You can see marvoules land marks like the Panamal Canal, and you can see important countries like Acropolis, Greece and Venice, Italy the city of water. You also can meet other people around the world, and help the people in need. As former Seagoing Cowboy said '' I'm grateful for this opportunity.''

The next reason why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is becuse you can see animals that you have never seen before. You can also take care of them until you reach the country that there supposed to be in. The next reason is that you can eat foods in other countries. You also can also be one of the reasons why some of the destroied countries are now one of the best countries in the world. Then you can learn more about the country and the animals you took care of.

Then here is the last reason why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy, you can also use up your free time. Seagoing Cowboys like to have fun they play games like Baseball and Volleyball. Then in the empty rooms were the animals were housed is now a Baseball field, a Volleyball court, a Table-tennis room, a Fencing stadium, a Boxing ring, and other games. You also can read books and whittle in your alone time.

8E5750734861,"World War ll was over and alot of damage was done to many countries. Some countries didn't have any food, animals, or supplies. So, Seagoing Cowboys, which are a part of the UNRRA, travel back and forth on a boat that carries a cargo of about 300 horses and enough food to feed them. This is a tough job for just a few guys becasue the animals need food, water, and their stalls had to be cleaned.

If you were a Seagoing Cowboy you would have alot of amazing opportunitys. In the story Luke states in paragraph five "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing China and Europe. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.""

You would also get to help people. You would get to take things that families need to them. Lastly, you could also have fun! On the way back when you don't have any cargo, you play or do fun activites. You could play baseball or volleyball where all of the animals where at on the way to your destination. Also you could box, fence, read, and have table-tennis tournaments.

Some people say they would not want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because of the long trip, but if you were doing fun activites such as reading, boxing, fencing, playing baseball, and taking care of the animals time would pass by. You also have the opportunity to see many new things. You could see China and Greece and lots of other countries. They also don't want to be a Seagoing Cowboy because they think you don't do much, but you get to take care of the animals and play games.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun. You can help others and serve your country also. You would see many new sights and do many fun daily activites.    ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent,0.4

There are also some bad thing about being a seagoing cowboy, Like getting ingured on the job.

This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.

I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.

Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.

It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

I was busy caring for the animals during the crossing. My job was to check on the animals every hour. I also found time to have fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball .

C6E1D9D58CEE,"Have you ever wanted to travel around the world and help people and animals at the same time? Well you can if you join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is an excellent program to join because of the experience, jobs you could do, and the cost.

Most people have a great time on this trip because they can visit many places and sight-see while they are helping others and animals near you. I have visited places like Greece and Italy. I got to ride a gondola in Venice and visit an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. When we were dropping off animals, we had time to play games like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. One night, I was on the boat and I got the job of being a night watchman for the boat and the crew. Since the boat was full of animals, I had to check up on them every hour for the entire night.

To be in this program, there aren't many requirements to get accepted. The requirements are that you have to have a diploma from the high school you went to and you have to be devoted to helping animals and humans around you. You also have to show respect to the captain and our crew members and you must show good character toward many others.

Luckily, there isn't any cost to be included in this amazing program. I was working two part-time jobs which were a grocer and a banker before my friend, Don Reist, invited me to travel the world with him in a cattle boat. The boat I got boarded on was the SS Charles W. Wooster and we were heading to Greece and 335 horses and hay were on board. It was obviously an interesting and marvelous experience.

To sum up my thoughts, boarding the SS Charles W. Wooster and signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys program was the best decision I have ever made and it was the best thing that has happened to me in my entire life. With the experience, cost, and job options you have on the cargo ship, it is an excellent choice to make. I'd suggest that you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program in the future.

E7C8FB41C6BB,"First, while I was on the boat with the Seagoing Cowboys, we had many things to do. One of them was that when the animals were off the ship we played baseball. The ship was big enough for it which was great for us. When the animals were on we learned new things about the animals. The male horses were the hardest to feed. They always kicked, but the females were nice and gentle while I feed them.

Next, when we went to China I saw so many cool buildings. Even some that have not even been seen no where else. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. That was a great thing to see. In Venice, Italy I took no a gondola ride though the city with streets of water. I never saw anything so beautiful in my life.

Then, what I learned on this trip was that helping others that lost something in a war is pretty fun. I got to learn new lauguage and what they ate before everything was taken from them. Doing this will help u see how hard it can be when a we come and you never know that one of the days you live you will feel how they felt when they lost food and a home and even loved ones. Doing this your becoming a better person and people will look up to you for that.

Last, with the honor to do this wonderful thing I became a honorable person. Even though something like this can change things and the way people look at me.

One place you would get to see is Europe. In Europe you could see countries such as Greece, and I got to even see the Acropolis. I also got to take a gondola ride through the streets of Venice, Italy. Another thing I saw in Europe was a castle in Crete. Another country I got to sight see was China and in China I went passed the Panama canal. Even with all this fun we had the pleasure of helping people.

I knew I would have a good time and have many adventures,but not like what I had when I was a seagoing cowboy. One thing that I did was helped out with cattle. I got to see and take care of many animals during my time in Europe and China. One of my jobs was the night watch job. During my vist it also helped me understand that not everyone had the type of great life that we take for granted.

Sightseeing is great becaue you get to see things that wil probably be a once in a life expirence. Getting a good expirence from all of this would be positive for your mind and your body. Helping others is the main reason that you should do this whole SeaGoing program! It woud be great for you to get out and see the world!

It would be great for you to go out and see the world, and it is pretty amazing. The trip to Europe is pretty educational, and humbling. You can learn about tides, and seafare, as well as swells and knots. These are all things I have learned over my ""nine trips---the most of any SeaGoing Cowboy."" It is also great for getting to know others, and learning about different cultures. Another very interesting topic that is brought up when you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys is the sightseeing.

Sightseeing is a great part of these trips. You see, when you get to wherever you are delivering you don't have to do the drop off as well. All you have to do is wait for the sailors but until then you get to look at the attractions. For instance, I saw ""the Acropolis in Greece"" which normally you have to buy plane tickets or boat tickets to get to Greece but when you join you get see these attractions virtually free! I also got to ""take a gondalo ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water!""

But the most important part is helping others.

Helping others is the whole reason you should sign-up. You are doing somethining good, not for your self, but for the world, or a specific part of the world anyway. You are also stepping out of your way to help others, you will be rewarded for what you did on Earth in heaven. You will probably, unknowingly save lives while doing this. Helping people is actually good for our brains, it makes us more satisfied with ourselves and we become happier, healthier, and more fun to be around!

You may be thinking we shouldn't go because we like our lives here. Well step outside your comfort zone, stand up for those people who need us, and be the man that says ""I will go and help these people!""

Here are some reasons why you should come. First you should come beacause it might be the only time you will get to go to help other people from World War ll, so that would be a great opportunity to come.

Another reason is you would get to see out side of you country,and you would get to see other countrys. Also you would see what culture and gods they worship. You might even learn new things like how to grow carrots, or watermelon.

One more reason is you can even have fun on board. Like when you are coming back the animals would be unloaded and you would get to pet them and maby some animals like fetch. You could even play volleyball, or baseball in the empty hold wear animals had been. They also had tournements like baseball,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also help pass time.

Cowboy because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime, as he says in paragraph one. Luke also wanted to help others who had been affected by World War ll.

Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and he loved to help the people.

Some people would probably refuse to go to another country that had just been through war some people would say it was to risky and unsafe well it is, some people might say that it is too dangerous to cross the ocean well it is but Luke felt that these were things that he needed to do and is something that is important to him.

Luke also got to visit many great places in between his journeys, he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great.

But some people might say that they wouldnt go there because once again it's just too dangerous or that if they wanted to go there then they definetly not go on a boat and they would much more want to fly there. Well once again that is their opinion and Luke was happy the way that he went and was happy that he could see it and that he go to experience the jouney.

2FDFE1F37A07,"Hello, my name is Luke Bomberger and I am in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Here in the Seagoing Cowboys program you are able to help people, travel the world, and also have fun a long the way. Now I will tell you about the experiences I have had as a Seagoing Cowboy and why you should join.

First I am going to tell you why I became a Seagoing Cowboy. When I graduated high school I had no idea what to do. Until my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no. I knew it was an opportunity of a life time. Then I started my journey.

It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. These countries needed food supplies, animals, and more to recover. Thats when 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA was an administration that hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of animals that were shipped overseas. Thats when Don and I signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys.

After the Pacific War ended in August, 1945. We received orders to report to New Orleans. The orders were to ship a corgo of 335 horses, plus enough hay and oats to feed them to Greece. The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to opportunity to travel to many different places. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and crossed the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War 2. I have also been to Europe and China. But seeing Greece was special to me.

Most people think being a Seagoing Cowboy is all hard work and that we don't have any fun. The people who say that are very wrong, Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of fun on their spare time. When we finish our orders we take some time off and do fun activites. In Venice, Italy, I took a gondala ride over a city with streets of water. In China I also toured an excavated castle, and marveled at the Panama Canal. Another way we have fun is on board. When the ships have been unloaded we play baseball games, vollyball games, fenceing, boxing, and many other fun things to help pass time.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help people in need, travel the world, and have fun a long the way. Being a Seagoing Cowboy has been much more than an adventure for me, Luke Bomberger. It has opened up the world to me.                         ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent,0.4

For example, you get to go on many trips around the world and go to places such as Europe and China and much more places. Another benefit is helping people and taking care of animals. My final reason is that it helps you be more aware of people in different countries and their ways of living and it's fun.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy gives you the chance to visit many places. I got to go to Europe and China. Seeing Acropolis was special. So was taking a a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with water for streets. I also toured an castle in crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Me and the other Seagoing Cowboys also crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States to get to China.

The other benefit was helping people and taking care of animals. Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. On my second trip, I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour. We had to help people in other countrys by recovering their food suplies, animals, and other needs.

The final benefit was that it helps you be more aware of people in different countrys and their needs. The opportunity made me more aware of how the people in different countrys lived and how they dont have their needs and how i was helping them with their needs. Being a Seagooiing Cowboy also is fun. On return trips we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had stayed. Table-tennis tournaments, boxing,fencing,reading,whittling, and games were fun ways to pass the time.

In conclusion i think you shouold be a Seagoing Cowboy becuase it has many benefits. The benfits are you got to visit many places and tour many places. The other benfit was that you got to help people and take care of animals. The final benefit was that being a Seagoing Cowboy made you more aware of people in different countrys and their ways of living and it is fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

A lot of people always dream of touring around the world. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, touring will be a normal part of life. For example, I, Luke Bomberger, got to see many sights. I was able to see the Acropolis in Greee, go gondala riding in Venice, Italy, see the excavated castle in Crete, and see the Panama Canal on my way to China. Not to mention just being all around Europe and China. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, sight-seeing will become pretty much a daily activitiy.

Most people in this world are animal lovers. For these people I can say that being a Seagoing Cowboy is the lifestyle for you. Everyday that you are on the cattle boat, you get to treat animals. I was on a cattle boat with 335 horses and it was an experience of a lifetime. I got to feed, clean, and care for the horses everyday. If you are willing to take on the responsibility of caring for animals, then sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will get to help others in need. For example, at the end of World War ll, many countries in Europe were devistated and destroyed. I helped by exporting animals such as horses, cows, and mules to other countries from Europe.

He rode the Pacific Ocean 18 times. No one's ever rode the Pacific 18 times. He started ride the seas in August,1945. When he was heading for greece he was 18 years old.

So,I think he rode the Pacific 18 because that was how old he was turning. But it wasn't that he wanted to ride the seas he rode the seas because World War II in Europe so, I think Europe was is homeland. Luke had found many countries in some ruins. The countries were running out of food supplies so,since Luke was generous he gave them the food supplies they needed even animals. How nice was that of Luke. Luke wanted to help them more so he told them to get in the ship.

Luke was incredible he made nine trips. It took Luke to cross the Pacific two weeks. So,If you times the two weeks it took him to cross and eighteen times he crossed is thirty-six weeks to cross the eighteen times. The ate and drank water but they had to be fed twice a day or three times a day. They played basketball and volleyball. Where the animals were housed there was more games to play like table-tennis but only tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,and other games. Being a seagoing cowboy was harder than having a adventure but thats Luke opinion.

You also get to go places you never seen before like, in the passage it said that Luke explored Venice, Italy. It is very fun too because, you get to also play fun sports like tennis, volleyball games, and table tennis tournaments. It takes a lot of hardwork to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Not only that, you can even find a family and settle down and have kids,but before you say yes and sign up for this cowboy program that sounds incredibly awsome and jump on the ship and die for some super crazy reason,it won't be my fault. There are some dangers out at sea and I can tell you how to avoid them. Step 1,if you see some people come aboard from diffrent places try to stay away for a little because you dont know what kind of disease, or sickness they could have. Say you bring a little bit of medicine if you get sick and you become best friends with someone from China or Japan and you or him didn't know he brought a deadly disease aboard and if you catch it,your more than likely going to die, so keep watch if someone is coughing or sneezing. Step 2,Try not to get night watch,the reason being is that if you fall overboard there is nothing anybody could do for you because you will be out there all alone. One of the best things about the trip is that you get to go to new places and you can get new stuff. Like if you go to like Japan and all the other places you can get new plants,inventions,new farming products and many more. The best part is,you can sell it. In the story it says that he did because they sort of needed him and he wanted to help. If you do go you wil not only be helping other people you can be helping even more by bringing new ideas and farming products and you can even tell them how to properly farm or even how to farm.

For example, you could go to Greece and see the Acropolis. I turned 18 before we arrived at Greece, which ment I could be drafted for military service. They told me to just keep working on the cattle boat, and that would count as my service.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program means you also get to work with animals. Some of the animals you get to work with are horses, young cows, and mules. It can take a while to get to our destination. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China!

The Seagoing Cowboys program can be very fun. Sometimes, the cowboys play games, such as, baseball, volleyball, and table tennis. Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun, but it can be dangerous at times. On my second trip across the Atlantic Ocean as a cowboy, I was a night watchman. I was supposed to check on the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly report, I slipped down a ladder. My feet shot toward an opening on the side of the ship.

If there wasn't a strip of metal that caught my side, I wouldn't be here today. I couldn't work for a while because i broke a few ribs. I thought that was fine, because I was still alive. I'm very grateful for the opporrtunity, because it made me aware of people in other countries and their needs. Its a wonderful expierence helping someone in need.

You could become a hero! This oppurtuntiy is to become one of the UNRRA's Seagoing Cowboys. Seagoing Cowboys travel all over the world to to recover countries that were left in ruins from wars. You would travel on a ship with animals and other cowboys to help people who's life seems to be in ruins.

It might just change your life, like it changed mine.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you won't regret it. It was a whole lot of fun. I got to meet other cowboys and you never get bored. When I was on board ships, especially on the way back, we played games and had some pretty fun competitions. We used to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty space that used to house animals. We fenced, boxed, and held table-tennis tournaments. It was a lot of fun!

You get to help people; this is a big reason to join. You get to become part of an organization that helps people who need it, desperately. You could become their hero. Becoming part of something like this changes your whole life. It made me selfless and aware of the world around me. That awareness has been with me through my whole life. Although I'm no longer a Seagoing Cowboy, I'm still aware of what's happening to people around the world and how lucky I am. I let international students and exchange visitors into my house as an effort to help.

You get an amazing expereince along the way. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see Europe and China, tour a castle in Crete, see the Acropolis in Greece, and even get a view at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have been able to have any of these experiences if it weren't for being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Now that you know all about the Seagoing Cowboys program and the benefits of being part of it, go sign up! You could be a person's hero. Mend the hearts of those who feel like they have nothing left. Feed those who hunger with no way to recieve food. Take the oppurtunity of a lifetime, and, maybe, it will change your whole life, like it changed mine.

Helping other people is awesome because then they look up to you. Caring for other animals is kind as well because then they will start to trust you and other animals will do the same.

Luke claim is it is an apportunity of a lifetime and it's an adventure, you get to freetime and do cool things, and it will open the world to you. Before Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy he worked two part-time jobs he worked in a grocery store and a bank. His friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe in a cattle boat. Luke thought this was a chance of a lifetime and he couldn't pass it up so he went. When Luke was on his way to China Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal. Now thats an adeventure and it shows how he had free time to do that. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger as he says. He says it opened the world for him. It allowed him to get a bigger picture of the world, and see what it was like. He says he is grateful for the apportunity and if you get an apportunity like that you should be glad to.

Have you ever thought about how the work done as a child can benefit how you are as an adult? Well, if any of these questions has even came to your mind than this essay is perfect for you.

Crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans would take a long time but I would say that it is worth it. Luke Bomberger traveled across the Atlantic six-teen times and he crossed the Pacific twice. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program so that you can travel across the oceans too. While onboard a Seagoing Cowboys' ship you can have baseball and volleyball games, you can have ping-pong tournaments (also known as table tennis), fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and playing all sorts of fun games to pass through the days onboard your ship. There are so many advantages to joining the Seagoing Cowboys but if you aren't sure if it will be safe then I will write about the little disadvantages of coming onboard.

So, your wondering about the disadvantages of joining the Seagoing Cowboys? Well, one day Luke Bomberger was working at his job as a night watchman and he had to check on the animals on board every hour. One night Luke slipped on a latter and he cracked his ribs. Luke started sliding toward the edge of the ship where a small strop of metal kept him from flying overboard. So if you think almost plumaging into the deep, dark sea is a disadvantage then there you go. Just because something dangerous ""could"" happen doesn't mean that it should hold you back from doing something that you could enjoy though. If you never try out something than you will never know if you will like it or not, so I suggest joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

Kids are always wondering why they have to do so much work. The reason is so that the work that they do as a child will benefit them while they are older. Luke Bomberger had worked on his aunt Katie's farm as a little boy and it had prepared Luke for hard work to be done at sea. You need to be able to work hard if you are going to join the Seagoing Cowboys than you need to ""work hard at work worth doing"" (quoted from Teddy Rosavelt).

If you like adventure than the Seagoing Cowboys program is perfect for you. Remember that this program isn't just about fun but it is also about working hard. There may be danger while at sea but it's a low chance that the danger will affect you.

Dear, jimmy

I heard you may want to be a seagoing cowboy. Being a seagoing cowboy is a great adventure and it teaches you a lot of things. Well let's make you'r decision final.

One good reason to be a seagoing cowboy is you get to help pople who have sufferd and have lost many realitives. You can draft for military service, but you do have to be 18 to draft for military service. I have had the most time of any seagoing cowboy my time is nine trips. Mabye you could beat my recored one day. Besides helpig people you could have the benifit of seeing places such as Europe, China, Greece, or Italy.

When your traveling the high seas it could take a while to get to your destination. For me it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China. You may have to take care of the animals for the crossings and this will keep you busy for a while. Some thing that you will have to do to take care of the animals is to feed and give them water two times a day. Also you will have to pull up bags of oats and hay from the lower holds. last but not least the stalls will have to be cleaned. once on my second trip I served as a watchman and I slid down a slippery ladder luckly a long strip of metal kept me from going into the seas.

There will be some times when you can have fun on board especially on the return trips because there wont be any animals in the stalls.

When we could have fun we would go into an empty stall and play tabble tennis, fencing, boxing, reading,whittling,vollyball, and even baseball.

But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure. It opened up the world to me. Im very gratful for this oppurtunity. It has made me more aware that others may need are help.

They help people if they need animals they will bring you animals from other countrys and if they need help building there houses and everything will bring you people that can build houses and better things!

Some reasons why you would want to join is because do you want to get drafted to the army? I don't think a lot of people do. So be a Seagoing Cowboy. If your with us you will not get drafted.

They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more. If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy. Luke traveled through the Atlantic occean and pacific. Trying to help these countries that were left in ruins. When Luke was on the boat he had a job to do. He had to feed the animals and keep them healthy. He also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you have a big responsibility. You also have alot of jobs to take care of. Another job Luke had, was a night watchman. That job was to check on all the animals every hour. Then make his hourly report to the captain. A Seagoing Cowboy wasn't always working. When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part.

So this is what a Seagoing Cowboy is and what he does. If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people. This job is perfect for you. While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places. It was just a big adevnture. Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Take the information that I gave you.

The text states "" He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" It will make you feel free being on a boat. The Part that is the best is getting to see all the wounderful sights. You could go to China, Italy, Greece, and other places. When you are a Seagoing Cowboy you can exlpore different places of the world. You get to meet different people and see how their coulture is different.

The second best thing is all the free time you have after the animals get droped off.

Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then he slipped and cracked his ribs so he coudn't work for a couple days. He also took care of cattle while on board.

The second reason is Luke going around the world. He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.

The last reason is Luke going around and giving supplies. In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for helping others. To sum marize the reasons. The program helps with people in need, the program goes around the world, and the program helps with livestock and supplies. Luke did a great thing to help with the world.

2BAA8312A66B,"Just think of all of the amazing things you could see and experience being a seagoing cowboy. Everyone should become a sea going cowboy. Theese three reasons are why: Everyone would get to see/ go to amazing places, the seagoing cowboys would get to help people in need that were affected by World War ll, and you would get to help care for the animals on board the boat. This essay will explain why everyone should be a seagoing cowboy.

The first reason that everyone should be a seagoing cowboy is because you will get to see/ experience amazing things and places. In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves Luke, the main character, said he went to places like Europe, China, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal! Who would not want to go there?

The second reason everone should become a seagoing cowboy is because the goal of the seagoing cowboys is to help people that have been affected by World War ll. Just think about how much that would mean to the people that the seagoing cowboys are helping and there family. To have lost everything, but the seagoing cowboys helped those people back to a good life.

The third reason everyone should become a sea going cowboy is because they get to take care of the animals. If they need food, someone gives them food. If they need water,someone gives them water. If they get sick or hurt somehow, then someone needs to help get them healed, etc. If the seagoing cowboys are not going to help someone or see something they are on the boat taking care of the animals.

Everyone can/ should become a seagoing cowboy. They should become a sea going cowboy because theese three reasons: they get to see and experience meny amzing places like China, Europe, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal, but those are just a few. They are helping people that were affected by World War ll. They also get to take care of the animals on the boat! Just imagine this life, helping people that were affected by the war, taking care of animals, playing games and experiencing amazing places. What could be better?

464CDE627A11,"There are many reasons I think you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. But I am going to tell you about some of my thoughts. I was just a small town boy when my friend brought up this proposal. I couldn't miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. You get to go to Europe by cattle boat. You get to take care of people and animals. Who doesn't love animals? You get to bring them food.

These animals and humans have been through too much. It is the least we can do. During the trip I became old enough to go to the military, but the recruits saw what I was doing and they told me to stick to it. I was serving my country in my own way.

I also got to take multiple trips, so if you are really into it you get multiple chances to help others. I think I took around 9 trips. But it isn't all work and no fun I actually got to see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, go on gondola rides in Venice,Italy, explore an excavated castle in Crete, and I was astonished by the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have seen any of those places if I hadn't taken the risk and become a ""Seagoing Cowboy."" But don't get the wrong impression it was hard work, definitley. But it was worth it seeing people and animals treated the way they should be.

I also had some cowboys I got to pass time with. We would play baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. We had table-tennis tournaments, we would do fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other various games.

But being a cowboy taught me many lessons. How to not be greedy because there are those who are less fortunate then us. It taught me to take a risk, work as a team, succeed as a team. I gained awareness about the people from different countries and different races. I almost lost my life on one of those trips but I would have lost my life doing something I truly loved. So that is why I think you should become a ""Seagoing Cowboy."" So are you in for the long haul?",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent,0.6
BBF429EE4427,"The Seagoing Cowboys Program can convince people because if you had Luke's job you can see the Panama Canal. You can also help people who have been hurt in the war. The job Luke had was to take care of young cattle,horses,and mules. So you would have a chance to take of animals just like Luke did. You can also be apart of the Military Forces and help wounded people. You can also see things that you probably never seen before like Italy,Panama Canal,or China.

It takes two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. You would also care for the animals during the crossings and it will keep you busy. When the war was over the towns were lefted in ruins. So you will be apart off the UNRR ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabiliation Administion). The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned.

Working on farms as a little kid can be great for preparation for the had work but not for the dangers of the sea. If your job my be watchman you have to check on the animals every hour. The job makes you aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Luke had been working two part time jobs and his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He didn't say no because it was an opportunity of his lifetime. The program was to give countries supplies to recover food. The UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)employed seagoing cowboys totake careof horses, young cows,and mules.

Luke and Don(his friend) had went to New Orleans to get their seaman's papers then went to Greecewith a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. luke turned 18 before he got to Greece and was able to be drafted for the millitary. When he got drafted an dfound out what he was doing they told to keep doing that for his service.

Some reasons you should join this program is for one you get to travle. Another reason why is you can help poeple when they need it most. Luke claims it is a once and a lifetime thing that you don't get a chance to do a lot. Lastly it taeches you to take care of animals properly.

For the Seagoing Cowboys you just don't travel you also have to do stuff. One of the things are taking care of the animals on the boat thatare traveling places. That's why were called the seagoing cowboys. All because we take care of animals on a boat while the boat is moving.

If you do join the Seagoing Cowboys you have to be carful becuase sometimes you might fall and get hurt. I had my ribs cracked one time because I slipt and fell. It hurt but I still had to do what I had to do for the animals. I got a little time off but, not a lot.

My name is Luke and I was a seagoing cowboy. One day my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I knew I couldn't resist the opportunity. It was 1945 and World War II was all over Europe leaving cities in ruins. Luckily, many nations came together to help support Europe. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were being shipped overseas. My friend and I both signed up.

We joined the group because we knew it would be an experience of a lifetime. We also wanted to help people and animals in need. It felt so good to be able to be called a hero. You also get to see many countries and their landmarks. They give you freetime to go and explore the city or town. You learn so much from the cultures and the different people who live there. Although it takes a lot of time, it is definitly worth the trip. You are so proud of yourself for helping people and animals. There is a lot of work involved and you have to be willing to do it. In the end though, it pays off.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy opened up a whole new world for me. It was definitly an adventure that I will never forget. It made me more aware of people and their needs. My family hosted a number of people from all over the world. It brought a new light into our eyes. We now know that not all people have what we have.

We would be helping alot of people and get to see amazing sights.

One reason more people should join is that we would be helping people. Many of the countries were left in terrible condition and need us to help them out by bringing animals over. The people joining would also be helping the Seagoing Cowboys. The Seagoing Cowboys need help taking care of the animals and cleaning the stalls. Bales of hay also need to be pulled up from lower holds of the ship.

Another reason more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that they could see amazing things in the countries they visit. It is an unbelievible opportunity to see Europe and China. Seagoing Cowboys also get to see amazing sights in Greece and Italy. Such as the Acropolis and taking gandola rides.

Some people say that they would not like to join because they think we will not get any freetime and we have to work the entire time. Yes, we do have to work but we still get time for fun. Especially as we return from the trips. We get to play baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis. We also get to fence, box, read, and play other games on board.

072A68594C7F,"Have you ever thought about participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program? It's every fun, it allowed me to go on adventures and vist unique places like Greece, Venice, Italy, and I even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are also others things to do besides go to different places when you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Even though you get free time there is also work to do. When my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I just couldn't say no, I knew it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime. Let me give you some reason on why you should join.

Like i said before there are others things you have to do when participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One thing is you have to take care animals. Everytime I found it fun taking care of the animals, especially on when I returned from trips and the animals had been unloaded. There were different types of animals on board like horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea. Once there was even a cargo with 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

My next reason is you also get to play games on the ship. The cowboys and I played baseball, volleyball games, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. These games helped us pass time when we didnt have work to do. Sometimes we would even play games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. We would even have different types of tournaments.

The most important and my last reason is that while in the Seagoing Cowboys we had to help different people with things. We had to help them with animals, food, and we had to help on the ship. There were many things we had to do on the ship like be watchmen, check the animals every hour, and make an hourly report to the captain. There is a lot of work you have to put in into being a Seagoing Cowboys even if you do get hurt. But it will be all worth it in the end.

I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It was very fun for me, so if i had fun being one then I feel like you will to. You will have a lot of fun trust me. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent,0.4

He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Luke signed up to join the program, which is, UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrations). The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

The program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" because they can take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So Luke and his friend signed up and they went to New Orleans. They found horses there. They keep on going to places, that was like an adventure to them. They keep on going and they were arriving to Greece for their second mission.

Luke turned 18 before arriving to Greece. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" Luke was also taking a ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water too. He was looking at a lot of things in Greece. His next stop was at China.

It took about two weeks to cross the Atlanta Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was so busy taking care of the animals. He took so many adventures. Being a Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It opened up the world to him.
