6F0F27DE9D99,"Luke Bomberger worked a two part-time job in a grocery store. He also worked in a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke said yes because it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

World War 2 was over in Europe which left many countries in ruins. To help recover everything 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys. Luke and Don decided to sign up to help take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

In August 1945 Luke and Don recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14 the day the Pacific war ended. Don and Luke boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece. The SS Charles had a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

It also took Luke about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke was busy all the time while crossing because he had to take care of the animals. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls also had to be cleaned.

On Lukes second trip he served as niht watchman. Luke's job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. Luke was happy to be alive, but coudn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.

Luke is trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program becasuse he wants others to help out recover other countries food supplies, animals, and more stuff that they have lost during the Wars. Luke wants everyone to be a part of helping others because without any help nothing is possibe.

Luke wants you to go through helping others and taking care of animals like how he did. Like when Luke got on the SS Charles W. Wooster when he was headed to Greece because the Pacific war had ended and everything was ruined or destroyed. He had a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. That is hard work. He had to stay up as watchman to take care of the animals and report to the captain. Luke got hurt but after the accident he began to help again. Luke want you to work as hard as him to save the world. Wars can cause a buch of damage to countries so try to help them out.

F9AC9F767EA4,"Luke bomberger had an interesting story to tell about his adventures on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such he would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join ""The Sea Going Cowboys.

Luke starts his story as a young boy [fresh out of high school] working at a grocery store and a bank, when his friend Don Reist invited him to work on a cattle boat with him. He accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such he was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for his servince so he spent another two years working on the boat. He says that he helped alot of people in China and Europe but he also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places; like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. He says that aside from his adventures he learned of how lucky he is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries he visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the men on-board played all kinds of games like Base-ball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The men also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading; the men also had tournaments for table tennis.

So, in short you get paid for working a third of the time, exploring foreign countries the second third of the time and playing games the last third of the time. There's no other way to describe it other than ""Best job ever."" ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
E89F3CF5C3C0,"Think about it, people all over the world are constantly getting themselves stuck in natural disasters losing lots of the things they need to survive. In passage 2 it says, "" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more''.

All this does is help recover families who have lost family members animals or shelter. most of the people cant survive without their food. Being a seagoing cowboy can be more than helping families but can spread the love and hope of God. In passage 9 it sais "" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" Im grateful for the opportunity'' he says.""

Now think if you were in this situation, wouldnt you want to have hope, know someone cares, restore the broken. It would also be challenging to try to live without food no to animals to even rely on for food. Think of someoneyou love, think about if they died. wouldnt you want people to come contfor you. It would also just be a fun experience getting to see new places if not before.

In conclusion if you wouldnt like to loose family, friends, or animals you rely on or just love come help those who have went through those times.

CEA16ADD393C,"Hi I am Luke and I want you to become a Sea Going Cowboy. Yes I know what you are thinking, what is a Sea Going Cowboy. Well let me tell you a little bit about it and lets see if you are interested.

A Sea Going Cowboy works for the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relif and Rehababilitation Administration). What I do is I take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped over seas.

Some of the benifits of my job is that if you are drafted into the army you can use this job for your service credit. One other benifit of my job is that I had the oppourtunity to see Europe, and China. But seeing the Acropolis of Greece was the best. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. I also was able have a tour of the great castle in Crete. Plus I was astounted at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Other benifits you might like if you like agriculture would be getting to feed the horses, clean the stalles. and pulling bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower parts of the ships. I definitly liked this part of the job because I grew up helping out on aunt Katie's farm and loved every minute of it.

Plus on your way home with out any responsibility to take care of the animals. you can play games like, basebal,volyball,table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading. and willting. These games also helped pass time on the way back from your journey across the seas.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than just a adventure for me. This experince made me relize how grateful I am. It also made me aware of people of other countris and their needs. It also opened my eyes up to the world to relize not everything is about me and my little small town, and that there are other peolpe in the world besides me who need help. And that awarenes I was talking about has stayed with me through my whole life. Leading to my family to host a numbe of international students and exchange vistors for many years now.

The Seagoing Cowboys is a program for cowboys that ride the waves caring for animals.

They care for animals that live on a land that just got destroyed.

There are a bunch of stories about their history.

They have been on the most dangerous assignments.

First of all, there is a reason that you should join.

That reason is to save a lot of animals.

Another reason that you should join this program is that this is right after World War 2, so animals need foof and water.

There is an organization called the

UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and there is only so much that group can do.

On the other hand, about this Seagoing Cowboys program, you can go anywhere in the world like Europe or China.

You have to make sure that you have enough supplies on the boat to care for the animals.

LIke if u have horses, then you would have hay and oats.

You can also take as many animals as your ship can hold.

One of the boats had 335 horse and still had enough hay and oats to feed them.

For the record, one more reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to go site seeing when ever you want.

You could go see a national landmark while you are on the job.

I remember this one person that was a Seagoing Cowboy, he went to Greece.

The toughest part of this job was going over a bunch of water and getting the animals back to where they belonged.

It would be so cool to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

To sum up my findings, I thought that this passage was a great example o fa job to do if you love animals.

I hope people consider this job.

When you are a seagoing cowboy, that means that you get to move cattle around on a boat and visit neat places. When I was a seagoing cowboy, I went to places like China and Greece. It was pretty cool, and I think you would like it if you try it. Now, I will tell you how to have fun with other crew mates.

After you drop the cattle off, you have some free space. To use that free space, me and my crew mates did a lot of fun activities. We boxed, we played baseball and volleyball, as well as table-tennis tournaments. It was really fun. Now is why you will see cool things.

When you are visiting places like China and Greece, you get to see cool things in those places. In Greece I saw the Acropolis. I also visited Venice, Italy, and went on a gondola ride. It was wonderful. I will now start to end.

While being a seagoing cowboy, you can see neat places. As well as neat places, cool structures. And, you can always have fun while doing this. I think that you should be a seagoing cowboy, it'll be the most fun you've ever had.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
3F2796434CCA,"You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The program will allow you to experience many different adventures and go to many unique and eccentric places. One time my friend, Don Reist, and I went to New Orleans after the Pacific War had ended. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and we headed to Greece with the cargo of 335 horses with enough oats and hay to feed them. That was my first order, and I had fun.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy, such as myself. Besides getting to help others, I had the side benefit of getting to see Europe and China. When I first went to Greece, I saw the Acropolis. I had also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. See, there are many adventures you can take on side of joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

One time when I was going to China, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings always kept me busy. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luckily for me, helping my aunt Katie out on her farm as a boy had prepared me for hard work, just not for the dangers of the sea. As another example, if you had the experience I did of helping on the farm you have been slightly prepared with hard work.

One dark rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot my feet torward an opening on side of the ship. The only thing keeping me from falling overboard into the deep, dark, and dangerous Atlantic Ocean was a small strip of metal along the edge. I was really happy to still be alive. But, I couldn't work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs. I'll admit it, there some dangers working as a Seagoing Cowboy. But, the people there really look after you, and they care about you.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. Participating in the program opened up a whole new world for me. I am really grateful for the opportunity. The program helped make me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.                 ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

In the text it says that Luke had no idea that his life would change once he graduated high school. He was working two part time jobs. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. the United Nations Relief and rehabiliation Administartion hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the Mule that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don helped and signed up for it. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. When he finally got there he helped on his Aunt Katie's farm. He went on a second trip. The cowboys all got along and began playing table tennis tournaments, baseball,volleyball games, and boxing and the games helped pass some time for the cowboys. The cowboy, also known as Luke Bomberger, lead his family to host a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many years. They arrivred in China August 14, the day the Pacific war ended. I bet his family was very proud of him. When he turned 18 I bet he was excited because he could be drafted for miltary service. Then when his board learned that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to just keep doing that for service.

Its not all just about helping animals once there all prepared & token care of you get to play with the cowboys! Baseball anything you desire they'll play.

It is a very good experiance to go seagoing. You get to see a lot of different places and meet different people with different life styles. Sometimes it is weird hearing them talk, but sometimes it can be funny. The people also ask about our country. They wonder about the people, food, and animals that we have. They also wonder what our houses look like.

I think you should go seagoing because it's like nothing else. Traviling the sea, and seeing the water as the sun sets. It's like nothing else. I also love the sound of the ocean. It calms me when I miss home. But sometimes, the ship feels like home.

Another reason Luke would try to convince you to join is because you could be helping people and countries by taking care of animals, such as horses, young cows, and mules.

Luke would also tell people to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you could visit new places you have never been to before, like Europe or China, or Greece and Italy. Luke had the chance of visiting these four places because he was part of the Seagoing Cowboys, and you get to cross oceans, like the Atlantic and Pacific.

Another reason luke would tell you to join the program would be because you would always be busy. The animals all needed food and water two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats ave to be pulled up from the lower level. And their stalls have to be cleaned.

Luke would also tell you to be careful if you joined the Seagoing Cowboys. On Luke's second trip, he almost fell into the dark waters of the Atlantic. He served as a watchman, and he would have to check on the animals every hour. And one rainy night, when he was going to report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. But luckily, a small strip of metal along the edge stopped him from sliding towrad the the dark Atlantic, and kept him aboard the ship. Luke was happ he was alive, but he had to take a couple of days off of work because he cracked his ribs.

But you can also have fun on the ship, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They would play baseball or volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped time go by faster.

Being part of a Seagoing Cowboy can be a great expierience, and it was for Luke Bombergur. It opened the world to him. He said he was grateful for the opportunity of being part of the program. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That's why you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys. It will give you great memories that will stay with you. It will give you life expierience that you might need later on in your life. It will give chances to visit new places you might love and never forget about. It will give you a chance of helping people and countries around the world. It will give you a chance to meet new people and to get to know them well. It will give you all of this and much, much more. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Our ship carried a cargo with 335 horses atleast and enough hay and oats to feed them. This expetition made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

So overall, if you don't participate in the UNRRA then you ar missing out. This once in a life time opportunity. If missed, you have missed out on one of the greatest trips you'll ever go on.  ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
899561F0795E,"A good reason for other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys Program is it's a good way to bond with animals, and you would get to see some cool places around the world that you can't see at home.

In the story it says that Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece, and he got to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

They traveled on the ship alot, so they had alot of time with the animals, since they took care of them. I think that if I were in the story I would join the Seagoing Cowboys Program because I like taking care of animals, and I like traveling and seeing new places.

I dont know if going to war would be so great, but it would be like serving your country, even if the most that you're doing is taking care of some animals. you still had a part in serving your country and that's all that matters.

Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys Program because he wanted to help people, and besides helping people he also got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. He also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Luke got to see some extrordinary places that some day I'd like to see too. And I know many others that would like to see some nice places too. These are just a few reasons why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program, but I'm sure there are alot more resons why you should join. Why'll Luke was on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the oppurtunity,"" Luke said. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.     ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
38F4CE28F1FC,"There´s nothing better than the Seagoing Cowboys Program! There´s no doubt that you´d feel great about joining it. The Seagoing Cowboys Program is a program designed to help other nations after the struggle of the Pacific War and WWII. Seagoing Cowboys deliver food and animals to areas that have devasted by these wars.

First, an obvious reason to join is that you would be helping citizens of struggling nations, and helping to make them prosperous again. After reading that, there should be no doubt about the good you would be doing.

Next, you would have free time to do whatever you wish in whatever nation you visit. I myself have seen wonderous things from China and all over Europe! You might see even more impressive things than I have!

At last, I think you are beginning to see things as I do, not only are helping others, you yourself are having a blast as well! So what what are you waiting for? Get out there and make a difference!!!          ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
0181A7606ADC,"Luke encourages people to join the seagoing cowboys program because he thinks since when he were in the program it was amazing I know this because in paragraph 5 it says the cattle-boat trips were unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy.

Also it says But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think he thinks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but he is impress how they are manaing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke trys to convince people to join this program is so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them alot I know this because in paragraph 7 it says Helping out on his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. Thats teaching him how to survive on his own he's getting taught and he is changing during this program so thats what he thinks this pro gram can do for other kids wanting to do this program.

Luke trys to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was in this program he worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because in paragraph 1 it says Luke Bomberger had no idea that hi life could change soon after his high school graduation. he was working part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think he trys to encourage people to join the program.

B87822A42BAB,"I am Luke Bomberger. I am a Seagoing Cowboy. This is a United Nations program to bring aid to European countries unable to provide for themselves after the war. We take care of the animals being sent overseas while they are on the boats. Our jobs are to feed and water the animals, bring the food up from below deck, and clean the animal's stalls. I know this sounds like a boring job that's all work, but there are many reasons why this job is so fun.

The first reason is because while you are in the countries you are visiting, you get to go sightseeing. I saw things like the Panama Canal, the Acropolis, and an excavated castle. I also got to ride a gondola in Venice. You may be able to see such famous landmarks as the Eifle Tower, or the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Oh, and did I forget to mention that you get paid for that? If you have always wanted to travel, then this job just might be for you.

Another reason is because you get to slack off on the return trip. On the trip home, you have dropped off all the animals, so you no longer have a job to do. This means you have free time to do whatever you want. When I was on return trips, we would start up baseball games in the rooms where the animals used to be kept. Other times, someone would bring a deck of cards, and we would spend hours just playing poker. Once, we even had a table-tennis tournament.

This is certainly a fun and exciting job. On a more serious note, this job can make you more aware of other peoples problems. There are many troubled countries across the world. You should do what you can to help. You could donate time to an aid cause as I did, or you could donate money to a charity. It really dosen't matter. Just do what you can.

06C940BE5758,"When I first graduated high school I never knew that my life could change so fast. I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat I couldn't say no because I knew that it was a lifetime opportunity. In the year of 1945 World War two was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins and Don and I signed up to go on the seagoing cow boy adventures.

When we got our seaman's papers SS Charles W. Wooster, we headed for Greece--with a total cargo of 335 horses and enough hay and oats to feed them. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and meant that I could possible be drafted for military service. When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. By the time I was discharged in 1947, I had made nine trips---the most of any seagoing cowboy. ""The cattle-boat trips wre an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" ""Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.

Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to me. It took two weeks to cross the Antlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings kept me busy.

I also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

In conclusion I think that everybody should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of all the sights especcially the Acropolis in Greece. Taking care of the animals is more than fun. On the return trips It was double the fun than going there we get to play games where the animals were once housed.

(United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They are a society that gives to those who have suffered from the war.

You should join me and the other Seagoing Cowboys so we can do an even better job of helping people! On return trips, we play games in empty animal holds such as baseball,volleyball,fencing,table tennis, and more! We have so much fun all the way home!

We have gone all over the world, we have gone to Greece, Venice,Europe, China, and other places around the globe!

595D3CCFD9E6,"Imagine being in a warzone either a soldier or civilian and all you can here is screaming, gunshots, bombs going off, and the smell of gun powder. This is what many people had to here and go through during World War 11. People lost there homes, are going without food and water, and are injured, sick, or dead. Now luckily the war is over but people still don't have what they need to survive. This is the reason why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help those in need.

My first reason is, the reasons why you are needed to help these people. World War 11 was a terrible war between almost every army in the world. It left hundreds of thousands of people homeless, injured, dead, sick, and without any food and war like i said before. This is why after the war the UNRRA ( The United Nations Relief and Rehab. Administration ) started the Seagoing Cowoys program and is another reason why you should join to help these people. Not to mention how if your under the age of 18 or recently turned 18 the program counts as your military service. You need to join so you could also save lives. Imagine it being a relative of yours in need that was in need after the war you would probably help but those people have families to and they need you and thats why u should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Another reason is, all the benefits of helping in the Seagoing Cowboys program. one reason is you wouldn't have to endure the danger of the military as for the program counts as military service which I have also told you before. This is not all because on the way back from your trips you enjoy the marvelous once in a lifetime chance to sightsee the places you've always dreamed of seeing in Europe. The last benefit is being able to enjoy and savor the moment of helping people in need as they thank and as you know you have done good for not only your country but the whole planet.

Lastly, I think before you accept the job you should know more about it. For this job you will be asked to use go on a ship for long periods of time with crewmen and animals to care for. You will have to feed and give water to the animals two to tthree times a day, clean their stalls, and trasport the safely to the destination. You may also have the responsibility of night duty where you protect and guid the ship and warn of storms and check on the animals every hor. You will then transfer this info. to the captain. You will also engage in many fun activities.         ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

For me, this opportuninty meant being able to witness extraordinary places, while being able to help others. For others and yourself it could mean just the same.

I had a great deal of fun on my trip. It gave me an opportunity to see many countries that I may not have seen on any other basis, such as Venice, Italy as well as parts of China, Europe, and Greece. I also chose to spend my off time playing sports and games whenever the chance came along.

Hi, my name is Luke, I just finished high school and want to become a doctor.

I love the idea of helping people.

That's why I'm signing up to become a ""Seagoing Cowboy.""

A Seagoing Cowboy is a person that goes on a boat across all kinds of different oceans to help countries that were effected by World War Two.

Also, I would like to become a Seagoing Cowboy because I would like to be remebered in different countries for heroic actions.

Not very many people can be famous for their actions in different places because there's no way to spread the news.

The only people that really remember you are the people that you tell, or the people that you helped.

I think it would be cool to be known all around the world.

I also think it would be cool to travel around the globe to explore.

Most off all, I want my mother to be proud of me, and I want to make history.

That is way I was super excited when I was accepted to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

I am going to be traveling around the world!

To me, that is a dream come true.

The only bad thing was, my mother was not proud, in fact, she wasn't happy at all.

She thought becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would put me in danger, in danger?

I was helping people, how could that be dangerous, I thought to myself?

I was NOT giving up on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.

I just had to convince my mom, and the rest of my family, that helping other people wasn't as bad as they thought.

Also that I would be very careful on the boat so that I did not get hurt.

""Mother,"" I called into the house I call home.

""Yes, Luke,"" called a sweet voice from the kitchen.

""I would like to talk to you about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy.""

I was very nervous that I would not be able to convince my mother about what I thought.

I wondered if I would even be able to convince her, or if I was wasting my time.

I was going overseas anyway, no matter what my mother said, because this is my dream.

My mother's voice broke me out of my thoughts.

""Oh, yes, I have been meaning to talk to you about that very topic."" I was glad that at least my mother didn't seem angry with my actions.

""I just wanted to say that I will be very careful when I am overseas, and I promise that I will not get hurt in anyway possible."" I wanted my mother to know that I wasn't lying any bit when I say that.

""I believe you, it is not you I do not trust.

It is that men that will be on the boat with you. You do not know any of them, or what their history is, how do you know if they are dangerous of not?""

""I just wanted you to know that I am going overseas tomorrow.""

The rest of the night was a blur, I told my mom why I wanted to do this so much, and eventually, she gave in.

She said that she supported me in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, and that she was always proud of me, only nervous.

I did go overseas the next morning, and enjoied it a lot.

I went to many places and saw many natural wonders.

Who knew how beautiful other places were.

A lot of places were very different than were I live.

Most of all, I was very glad that I got to help other people along the way.

In fact, I was very suprised how good it felt to know that I touched so many lives.

Oh, and did I mention that I have the record for how many trips one Seagoing Cowboy has done! I'm at eight right now, and I am thinking about going on one last trip before going home for good.

I can not wait to stay home and spend lots and lots of time with my family.

You wouldn't believe how long it has been since a have had some of my mother's homemade pudding!

I can not wait to have some, and when I say mother's homemade pudding, I mean homemade heaven!

Even though I have enjoied this experience very much, I will be glad to go home.

I have seen many cool creations.

For example, the Panama Canal, and I toured an excavated castle!

DC61CC02C7CE,"I crossed the Atlantic Ocean over ten times. I crossed the Pacific twice to help people who were struggling from World War II. The article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" writtten by Peggy Reif Miller was not only a story for encouraging people who are down and need to do something, but it also gives the main charcter's point of veiw too. Miller tells us how daring the adventure can be over seas, but what I tell is totally different. When I was over seas I saw many beautiful things. Miller may thought it was scary, but I assure you it is not.

When I was out of high-school I was working two jobs. I worked at a grocery store and at a bank. Then my friend Don Reist gave me a call asking if I wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was an opportunity of a life time. I said yes. It was 1945 and as you know World War II was going on. In August 1945, I received orders to report to New Orleans. We arrived the 14 of August, the day the Pacific War ended. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece. I could become apart of the army. The board saw I was apart of the cattle-boat trip. So they told me to stay on it. I was fine with it. By the time I discharged in 1947, I made nine trips. The most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Maybe one day you could become the Seagoing Cowboy to make the most trips. Maybe you could become apart of the army. If you become apart of the Seagoing Cowboy you can accomplish many things. I told you it's not scary. Your making exhilerating things happen.

The cattle-boats were an unbelievable opportunity for me. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special though. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It was extrordinary! I was done with the tours and we were crossing the Atlantic from the easten coast to the United States of America. I was on duty of cleaning stalls and feeding the animals. I was watch man for one night. I was making my report to captain when I slipped on the ladder. I most fell into sea, but I recovered. I had a few cracked ribs, but I was fine. I had time to have fun on board. I played many games with my friends. Some games we played were volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. A Seagoing Cowboy kind of sounds fun now doesn't it. You could have so much fun with your friends and other new people. You can have fun with the animals. The big part of being a Seagoing Cowboys is getting to say this, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

797F82E8CB85,"Do you want to help other countries? In the process you can see, and take a tour through the ruins of great places. That's what Luke in, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" did. More people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

If you join you would be helping countries after World War II from all over the world by, bringing them horses, young cows, and mules. You can help nations rebuild since World War II destroyed a lot of land. I know this because in the text it said, To help these countries recover their food, supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.) Some may argue that sending all of the animals overseas might reduce the animal population in that country that is sending them away. But really we have enough cattle in places like America.

Also joining will give you an oppurtunity to visit all of the ancient ruins of a great city. The author wrote, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" On the other hand people will say that they have already seen the Acropolis or China or Europe, but the countries\cities are fascinating. I think you could see them again.

Last it teaches you how to be hard working. I know this because, On the second trip Luke served as a watchman. His job was to check on all of the animals every hour, One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. It teaches you something, but sometimes it's dangerous. Luke almost flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

That was my persuasive essay, do you want to join the program now? I still think more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that seeing the Acropolis in Greece would be amazing as well as seeing China and all of its great places.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Well you should become one. I am goinng to tell you about how It is an amazing adventure filled time with amazing sights, how you can help people, and things you get to do while on the ship and off the ship.

Being a Seagoing Coyboy let's you have the time of your life by having amazing sights. One time while I was there I got to see the acropolis from ancient Greece. If you join you might just be able to see amazing places just like that. Also I got to have the benifit of seeing Europe and China. One of the most amazing thing I got to see was in Venice, Italy the street of water. So you should become a Seaging Coyboy because you have the benifit of seeing amazing sights and views.

Being a Seagoing Coyboy can give you the opportunity of helping people in need and that is very important. You can help them if they come right off of the war you can go help re-build their towns or suppling them with animals to help. Also you get to bring food suplies to help them recover from a war. Helping people is very important so that is just another reason why you should become a Seagoing Coyboy.

You may think you will have nothing to do while you are on the ship. Well that is not true. Some of the things you can do is play sports and other activities like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. Those activities help pass time while you are at sea. Also other things you can do is do your chores on the ship like cleaning the stalls where the animals stay, feeding the animlas, and watering the animals. Those are just more reasons why you should become a Seagoing Coyboy.

After you read all of this I hope you decide to become a Seagoing Coyboy.

They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Luke Bomberger and his friend Don Reist signed up.

Luke exclaimed that besides helping people,he got to see other countries,such as Greece,and Europe.

He also toured an excavated castle in Crete.

Luke had to take care of the animals daily,they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

Food and bales of hay had to be brought up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke said that helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for hard work, but not for the dangers of the sea,on his second trip luke served as a watchman.

His job was to check on all of the animals every hour.

One time he said he slipped and fell on his backside and his heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening side of the ship,thankfully a sharp peice of metal stopped his slide,or he would have flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

He was happy to be alive,but he could not work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs.

Luke also found fun on board,especially on return trips.

When the animals had been unloaded,the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

Many don't truely know what the Seagoing Cowboys is. During World War II, many animals were sick and had a scarce supply of food in Europe. The UNRRA decided that the needed a special position for horses and cows. That is the Seagoing Cowboys.

Some people may wonder about the experience and commitment of the Seagoing Cowboys. It is an outstanding experience for anyone! I get the daily benifit of seeing sights in Europe and China like the Acropolis in Greece. I've also rode a gondola in Venice, Italy! What else is on your bucket list? In addition, I've toured an excavated castle in Crete and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China!

Any sea lover or animal lover should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It took a few weeks to travel on the Atlantic Ocean from the east coast to get to China. I attended to the animals and feed them in the ships.

Many people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is no fun, all work. You are wrong! We play activites like baseball and volleyball in empty areas. We always enjoy the competative nature of table-tennis, fencing, and boxing when we are off work. Any readers would love to join, as many Seagoing Cowboys love the places a story can take you. Games are a jolly part of any off day with the team. Also, the experience is even more exciting when you bring a friend. Sure, all of the Seagoing Cowboys are your family, but a friend makes the family even closer.

609FABF99E0F,"I think that from Luke's point of view it looks like a great experience and it would be an opportunity of a lifetime to be a Seagoing Cowboy. By being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to travel and see many amazing places and meet so many types of people. Also if you like animals you are in luck because you get to take care of them while your on the boat sailing across the sea. Another thing you might get to do is have your birthday some awesome like Luke did in Greece. In the following pharagraph I am going to be telling you some things about being a Seagoing Cowboy like what it's like to take care of the cattle, some amazing places that you might visit ,and how you must be careful while board the ship.

By being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to do so many things and experience them. One huge thing that you would have to be willing to do is take care of all of the animals on the ship sailing with you like young cows, horses, and mules. Like Luke the animals on the ship would keep you busy, you would have to feed them and give them water at least three times a day, pull bales of hay and bags of oats out from lower holds of the ship, and clean out the stalls. Also you would get to go to many amazing places around the world like Luke did. You might get to go to places like Europe and China and see Acropolis in Greece, and maybe take a gondola ride in Venice, and see Italy the city with streets of water. You would also have to be careful while board the ship. One night Luke slipped down some stairs and almost went over board, and because of this he cracked a couple of ribs and had to take a break off the job. It would be quite an adventure to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Now that I have told you some thrilling things about be a Seagoing Cowboy what do you think? I think it would be so much fun to sail acrossed the world while taking care of animals and going to all kinds of places. It would be so exciting, but it would also make me nervous because when Luke Bomberger was a Seagoing cowboy he almost went over board. I think that by being a Seagoing Cowboy it would open up the world to you and how you thought of the world just like it did to Luke Bomberger who was an amzing Seagoing Cowboy. So know that I told you what I think it would be like from Luke's point of veiw I hope that I encourage you to want to being a Seagoing Cowboy.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

7ED3F95927F1,"The Seagoing Cowboy program is hard work but it is pretty fun. You get to help people that endured the 1945 World War 2 restock on food, animals, and more. All of us together make 44 nations that have joined together to help the people in need. The Seagoing Cowboys were part of the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) organization. A Seagoing Cowboy will take care of the animals including the horses, young cows, and mules that are on board. You get to see amazing monuments and you get to sight see and have fun. This is an opportunity of a lifetime so you should join this amazing program.

One of the reasons that you should join the program is because while you are working, you get to enjoy the wonderful views that the ocean gives you and you get to see building that you would have to pay a lot of money for. I got to see Europe, China, and the Acropolis in Greece. When you are having a bad day you can just look out and see the beautiful sunset and marvel the sights that you can look upon.

Another reason is once the animals are unloaded, you are able to find some time to yourself and have fun on the ship. You are able to play baseball, volleyball, and tennis. The Cowboys also did fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass time. You would find an empty stable and gather a few people to play with you.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboy program to help the UNRRA. You will enjoy having lots of fun with us but not only that, you can see marvelous evenings and daylights. You can also admire the beautiful buildings the you will see on the trips that you take.                     ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

The first reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because you get to help other people, animals, supplies, and you get to feel what its like to be in that place. And you do get to see some pretty amazing sites. You do get to go over sea, and you will be with other people so you won't be lonly. And you can be under 18 to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

The second reason you should join is because you will not be lonly, you will have friends there, also you can get friend or family to join if you want. you also can play games on your way back. And it is the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) who are hiring you to work for them. And yet why wouldn't you want to join, it is a one in a lifetime opportunity.

Some people say that you should not join reasons why, well frist off they that you can be killed which is true but yet very low chance of that happinging. They also say that its not worth it and that all that stuff is going to be gone anyway but yet before you can lose the supplies why not use them to help. And they say that you can end up bringing crimanals but yet the Seagiong Cowboys would most likly will bring criminals to safe places but yet make sure that they don't hurt anyone.

Once Luke Bomberger had hauled ""335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" It's an amazing experience that many people would love.

First of all, being on board across the ocean meant ways to pass time. ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animnals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games helped pass time.""

Most people might say that scince you are overseas, it could be dangerous. Yes it could, Luke cracked his ribs while trying to avoid falling into the Atlantic. (Ironic, isn't it?) But it is a lot of fun going across the oceans with some friends.

If you're reading this article, I'm guessing you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It's an interesting job. It doesn't require any special skills or years and years of experience. You just have to know how to take good care of animals and not get seasick easily. It's not that hard. Read on; I'll show you why.

There are a lot of great reasons to join the program. Here are some. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy,(Yes, I was!) along with helping other countries get back on their feet, I got to see awe-inspiring things, such as the Acropolis in Greece and the Panama Canal on my way to China. Taking care of the animals wasn't that hard. Sure you had to clean the poop-ridden stalls and carry up heavy bags of oats, but the animals made great company. On rides back home, you could relax and play games with the rest of the crew.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy could be dangerous, too. Once, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down a slippery ladder and almost went overboard and died! Luckily I got away with only a broken rib and more caution. People in the countries we aided could've been hostile. Seas could've been violent. Storms could've broken our ship to bite-size pieces. Fortunately, none of that happened;most of my trips were safe ones

When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought. The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today.

You can care for animals, have watch duty, steer the ship, and many other jobs that are needed when being a sea cowboy.

Just take it from me, Luke Bomberger one of the most famous sea cowboys in America. Thanks to my stories you'll know all the possible careers and benefits from being a sea cowboy. First, lets talk about some of the jobs that probably fit your interest. First of all if you want to watch animals, or nurse them back to health if they get sick then this is the job for you! Normally, on just one ship there can be up to 350 animals. That's a lot of sea cowboys feeding, cleaning, and nursing animals. Not interested you say, then you can ask for some extra watch time. Everybody has to do at least one night watch per night and you could do someone else's work, while they clean animals. This job is perfect if you enjoy getting some fresh air. Just don't be afraid of heights! Still not the right job, then you can take over or be the captain. This job is perfect for anyone interested in being the captain of a boat, for a career. You will most likely stay high up, but you can't accidentally fall to your doom, doesn't that sound safe?

Now you've finally picked your career, good job! Now you can look at the benefits of working as a sea cowboy. It might seem boring on the way to Europe, picking up after animals that relieve themselves everywhere, but with the animals gone and the stalls empty you can play games to pass the time. You could just simply play a board game, or maybe set up a ping pong table that you had to move because the chickens kept pecking away at it. Heres another benefit, while your ship is being loaded with food for the trip back you can go sight seeing! You can see the Panama Canal, or a castle on the island of Crete.

This is marvolous, even I myself am jealous of what you might get to do.

You have now seen the great benefits of becoming a sea cowboy. All that's needed now is for you to sign up, be drafted and not only will America thank you, but all the people of Europe will. Bonjour!",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

You can see some amazing places and objects you may never see if you weren't on the boat with the them. Learn something new everyday while your on this boat! In paragraph 9, Luke said, ""I'm grateful for the oppertunity."" Also in paragraph 5, Luke said, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Not all of the Seagoing Cowboys is all work though. During return trips you can have a lot of fun. I paragraph 8, Luke said that the cowboys play volleyball and baseball games in the empty holds where the animals were kept. Table-tennis, fencing tournaments, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games also pass time while returing home.

C604BC9A6C25,"I Luke think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join because it is a chance of a life time. Also you will be able to see new things like Europe, China, and Venice, Italy. You could also see an excavated castle in Crete and you can see the Panama Canal.

For those of you out there who love riding boats or want to ride one, this is the perfect program for you. You can bee on a boat for the longest of a month at a time just going to a place like China.

Also if you love helping for comunity service or helping others this is perfect because you can have fun and help others while in this program. The other cowboys and I played a lot of fun games while abord the boat like baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been held. We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other activities to help pass time.

My final reason you should join this program is if you love animals this this is the at most best program to join. This is true because you are always near the animals you get to feed them and pet them and even talk to them you know if you like things like that. They also start to seem like your own pets. Just I just want to tell you do not name them. If you name them then you will get to detached and will be really sad when you have to give them up. Trust me I named my favorite horse and it was so hard for me to leave Betsey in China. I hope you will be joining us in this program soon. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

D6EE958FBA73,"There are many differant reasons why you should participate in being a seagoing cowboy. These reasons are the following: you are helping people, you are helping their country, and you are helping spread peace.

The first reason that you should consider being a seagoing cowboy is that you are helping other people. You are helping them by bringing them cattle or other farm animals. By delivering farm animals to them you are helping them by giving them a food source. The people you help can eat eggs from chickens or drink milk from cows or even just kill the animals for food. Sometimes you might even just be delivering someone their pet that they shipped to safety therefore reunighting those people with their beloved pets. People can also use wool from sheep to make clothes or rope. That is how you are helping people.

The second reason is that you are helping those people's country. You are doing this by helping their economy. By delivering farm animals to them you are not only giving those people food and materials for themselves but, those people can sell them. By selling food, drinks, and materials or clothes those people are helping their economy and elderly people who cannot care for such animals. They wouldn't of been able to help their economy is they didn't have the animals to produce goods. That is how you are helping their country.

The third and final reason why you should be a seagoing cowboy is because you are spreading world peace. You are spreading world peace by giving another country something they need. If you help a country and its people they are going to take that as an example. They might help another country. Then, that country will help another and it will just keep on going like that. That is how you are spreading world peace.

That is why you should become a seagoing cowboy. You will not only help the countries in need but, also you will be helping their people and maybe even the world. ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

79ADC35AB210,"Working on cattle boats are great, I believe that everybody should work on them And there are many good reasons why you should work on cattle boats And here are just some reasons.

One reason why working on a cattle boat would be you can help save farm animals. I'm not saying that farm animals would go completely extinct, but The population could go way down because of the war going on right know. Many countries were left to ruins so the animals would not have any food, shelter or even maby water.

Onother reason is that you Get to travel all around the world and get to see many different things. One time on my way to china I got to tour a excavated castle in Crete, and also marveled at the Panama Canal.

Also on the way back from trips when the animals were unloaded, we all found our times to have fun. We would play Baseball, volleyball games and many more exciting things that interested us on the way back wile we were not doing anything.

04E13ED4CD04,"Why should you join the Seagoing Cowboys program? Well, there are many reasons. Firstly, you have many chances of adventure. Who knows what could happen, but it could be worth the risk. Another reason you should consider being apart of the great program is the exprience. This could be a once in a lifetime offer that may never apear again. Furthermore, the learning oppurtunities are endless, and maybe even fun.

The places you could go. It almost seems like a dream when thinking about the many chances and oppurtunities that may stand with an open door. You could meet some great, new people. See some great new places. Luke stated from the passage ,""Besides helping people, I has the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" You have the life-changing chance to not only help the needy, but to see things some don't have the chance to. Not only see, but exprience.

Expriencing new things can be terryifying, but can be something incredible as well. You can visit museums, ride bikes through the city, dine at the fanciest restaraunts with some new-found friends. Not only can you do all of those things, you can become close with the animals and other workers while on the journey. You may be busy throughout, but think of the job you are doing for so many in need, It's all worth the work. Expriencing is also learning.

Learning new things is like having money in your pocket. You may need all that you learn one day, and you need to be prepared for whatever life throws at you. One of the many things for you to learn while being a Seagoing Cowboy is how to care for animals. Animals have needs like humans. They need food, water and sometimes shelter to survive life's harsh ways. Another thing you may need to learn is how to communicate in other languages, or maybe how to speak in that language. You may also need to learn how to cook different foods, or how to live in harsher conditions like some do in other countries. The possibilities are endless whe it comes to learning new things, sometimes they are as simple as doing the dishes. But we can agree that there is more fun things to do rather than doing the dishes.

Stated in paragraph 8, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, esprecially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and vollyeball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading and games also helped pass the time."" Finding ways to entertain yourself doesn't seem to be hard when you have many crew members who would eargerly accecpt the oppurtunity to play a good game of catch.

In conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboy seems to be a great oppurtunity for many to exprience. The many fun activites, the great cultures, the amazing people, and new things to learn should be enough to convince someone to become a Seagoing Cowboy and do some outstanding things for those in need.

503E1602666C,"I think that you should join the seagoing Cowboy program because you can go over sea you can be at a certian place in just a couplle weeks but it all depens on how far away it is. My reason to join this program would be that evveryone should have a chance to do things that they can't do in a normal everyday life. This started a while back I was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no. I knew that it was an opportunity of a life time.

I knew this because it isn't everyday that you can go out to sea and go to a different country. This was my only chance to help out and go to another place, but if I would have said no then I would have never of gone to Europe and I would still be at home working to jobs and not being able to do much of anything but work and work and work. At my first trip I wasn't at Europe until after I was 18 when this happened I could draft myself for the U.S. army and would be able to do this all of the time. When they got my draft they told me to keep doing what I was doing. What I was doing was feeding the animals. Then on my second trip I was on nightlook out. Every hour I had to check on the animals and make sur ethat there was nothing wrong with them. After a while it started to rain and I slid down the metal ledder and I cracked my ribs.

F01928C4364C,"Luke thought he couldn't give up this opportunity of going to the Europe on a cattle boat. It was only a opportunity of a lifetime but Luke couldn't say no. The story is kind of telling us if there's a only one lifetime opportunity then take it because it could go away and the chances of getting to go is probably in a couple of years or one year. Luke couldn't give it up, it was special to go. Luke wanted to go was because he knew it probably once in awhile and that his mom or dad or family member couldn't afford him to go to the Europe on a cattleboat. Luke instead went with his friend, Don, because it was nice of Don to let him come with him. That was so nice to Don. Not a lot of people is that nice to their friends, in fact a lot of friends are a lot mean to their best friends instead of caring for them. I know this because, "" He knew it was an opportunity of a life time.""

Joining the program is very good news because not a lot of people gets to join the prgram because of A, they have a lot of things to do, or B, they can't afford anything. Luke probably thought it'll be interesting to go join the program they have. Joining the program is like helping out something, maybe helping animals, nature, the Earth, and the environment. To join the program I think it's going to be like doing hard work and helping with a lot of stuff and of coarse helping with other people with their work. Also the thing is that you got to be a hard worker to join the program other wise you probably couldn't get the thing.

Of course the reasons Luke joined in was probably because he wanted to help even though it was kind of challenging but Luke knew he had it in him. I know this because in the text it states, ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" It's like telling us that Luke didn't know this was hard. Luke posibly thought it'll be easy for him to do. But it sucks to have a few cracked ribs and not going back to the job he had. In the text it states, "" Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Also I know, "" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the Untited Nations Relief and Rehabililation Administartion).""

Luke is or maybe a hard worker when it comes to things that includes hard things in a job. Luke knows what to do since it's like his job to do what he was asked to do right. Luke was strong about when he cracked his bones. He gotten more stronger. Luke went back to his job and did it more better. Luke is probably a nice man then anyone else there in the group. Luke deserves much better than this what happened to him on the job he was doing. In the text it states, ""Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy."" Also I know, "" By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke has made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.""

Luke liked being the Seagoing Cowboy and he thought it was an amazing adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the worled for him. He is grateful of the whole thing.

AEAD260656B4,"Have you ever heard of the Seagoing Cowboys program?

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a thing alot of people should do. We help out with alot of stuff such as animals, and problems that where hard to solve after World War 2. You could also see amazing sights. I'm going to tell you all about the Seagoing Cowboys program.

In 1945 we had to help with horses in New Orleans. We had to make sure they had enough hay and oats to be fed with. Although there was 335 horses to feed we still helped out. For instance we crossed the alantic ocean for 2 weeks, just to get to China to help out. First,We fed them, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower parts of the ship. Then all the stalls had to be cleaned.

If you joined this program you would get to see amazing sights. Its a once in a lifetime chance to travel to China, Europe, Venice,and Italy. I got to explore the castel in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There is so many sights to be marveled at or explored. You should try this out.

There is so much more than helping animals and seeing amazing monuments and sights. You would also get to help people. There are lots of people out there who dont have much food or any shelter. World War 2 is the cause of this harm to people. First of all, helping people could give you a good reputation. Secondly, its nice to help people who are poor and don't have shelter or food. Lastly, I think it is a good thing to do for those people.

People fought in World War 2 and now its your turn to step up and lend a helping hand. This program is possibly the most helpfullest program in the U.S.A.                    ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Well then join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" of thje UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) today! You will get a one in a lifetime chance while spending time overseas, traveling to new countries, and spend all of that time with horses, young cows, and mules. Not only are you going to travel to new places, you will also see many different sights you may never see again. After a hard day at sea caring for different animals you can play games, have a variety of different sports tournaments, or just play rounds of games such as basketball or volleyball.

While most people don't call fun feeding and watering horses, there is much more to being a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" that just that. After your turn to feed or water that animals is over, board games or even just playing with a deck of cards are options. After you get off of the ship there are hundreds of activities and tourists attractions in the different countries such as Greece, China, Crete, and many more places all around the world that you can see and do. In Crete there are ancient Greek castles in ruins, in Greece you can see the Acropolis (which was a very special occasion for me). I even took a gondala ride in Venice, Italy. Doing this job has many benefits other than just helping horses and other animals.

On top of all of those reasons for being fun, I also had a great time spending time with the animals. Doing this job isn't as simple as it sounds though. I had to know when you need to feed or water the animals (which is two to three times a day) and I also had to make sure they didn't get sick on the voyage. On top of that you also have to carry the hay and oats for 335 different animals onto the ship. But, although it's not easy, it still was a lot of fun for me and I'm guessing it was also fun for the other people that went on the trip too. I enjoyed this job so much, I did it nine times because it was so much fun. I enjoyed doing it so much I did it the most out of anyone, and I think you will too.

The final reason I think you will enjoy doing this is because this trip is a one in a lifetime opportunity. Some people have never been on an airplane, some people have never been on a boat, but this is different. This is more than just a family vacation. This is an opportunity do something different. This is a chance to go do something most people have never done before. While you may have plans to go to a different state, or a different country, how many people have ever said ""I want to travel across the seas with hundreds of different animals just to ship them to a different country."" This is not something everyone gets to do. Make it something you get to do.

This is something everyone should want to do and I just gave you three reasons why you should do it. This is a one time time chance to do something most people have never done.

If you have been wanting to go seight-seeing, you will get to see lots of nature's art from a distance where you can see it all not just once, but many times.

3D1E296AF2DA,"Do you want to be a seagoing cowboy? I was once, and I think that the experience is very fun-filled and educational. You will meet many different types of people on your journey. Does it sound fun? Well, here are some reasons that you should decide to become a seagoing cowboy.

First off, you will find that there is always something to do on board the ship, I found that there are many things to do so you can pass time. I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed on return trips after the animals were unloaded. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games were some of the activities that we did.

Also, when you are off the ship and you need something to do, you can explore the surrounding area. On my trips, I toured an excavated castle, saw the Acopolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are many things to see and do anywhere you are.

Lasty, you always know that the things that you do help many people in many ways. I always loved seeing the smiling faces of the people that I gave my time and energy into helping them. The people that we helped were survivors of World War II. Their belongings were destroyed, and most of their countries were left in ruins. We gave them food supplies, animals, and more.

So, do you want to be a seagoing cowboy now? If you do, thats great! The experience lets you remember that what you did changed peoples lives forever. If I had the chance to become a seagoing cowboy again, I would take it. This made me more aware of what life was like for other people.        ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
8E915F00ACCE,"When I got involved in the Seagoing Cowboys program, it allowed me to do many things I had never done before, and go places I had never seen. If I hadn't of joined the program I would have had to stay where I lived and would've never seen the places such as China, the Panama Canal, Italy, Europe, and Acropolis.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy, I was able to see the other side of the story from people on the other side of the world. When I lived in America, al So, I joined in on the Seagoing Cowboy program, thinking that just maybe, I would be able to make a difference in this world. Having prior knowledge about what exactly ""hard work""

I was able to get many things accomplished that other people in that program that normally people wouldn't be able to do. Besides just helping devastated people with their homes destroyed from the battles of World War two, I was also able to have unique adventures to places that you don't typically go to everyday. Besides from that, when I was on my second year of being a Seagoing Cowboy, I was serving as night watchman. I was making my hourly reports to check on the animals every hour when I had slipped on the ladder and I went feet first towards an opening on the side of the ship. Luckily, a strip of metal along the edge of the boat had caught my fall and kept me from flying over the edge into the dark Atlantic ocean. Altough I had a few cracked ribs from the inccedent, I was able to find some sort of fun to do while I was waiting for the animals to be unloaded. All of the cowboys decided to get together and play baseball and volleyball in the empty stalls where the animals had been. We also found games to do like table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and game helped us pass time. Not only that, but being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than just an adventure for me. It opened up a whole new world for me. I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Being able to see this, I was able to recruit many international students and exchange visitors for years, and maybe, you will too.

First of all, we travel all around the world and try so many new things. There is so much more to this world than you think. The Seagoing Cowboys and I got to see all over Europe and China. We even got to spot the Panama Canal on our way to China! We also were able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see the Acropolis in Greece, and tour a castle in Crete! I wouldn't trade anything for those adventures. Anyone can have this experience, after all, I was just a small town boy.

Another reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy is that we have so much fun. During our long voyages, we play lots of games. After unloading the animals, we played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds. To pass the time, we would have table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, whittling, and even reading. We just did so many fun things together, the trips didn't seem to long. Before we knew it, we would arrive at the docks, ready for another journey out to seas.

And maybe he could do it but sleeping on a boat? Won't that be uncofortable. I've never slept on a boat but going through all the waves, the boat moving side to side, the sound of waves hitting the boat. You wouldn't get some good sleep.

Some people get sick on the boats. And you have to go through that every single day. The article said it took about two weeks to get across the pacific ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to China. That's like sitting in vomet for a month.

What would you have to eat every day. You can't keep food on a boat for a month. The boat would only be filled with food. Unless your going to have the same thing every day. That would be boring. I wouldn't do that!

There had to be a rainy day or even a storm at one point in that month. What would you do all day? You have no internet, you can't really play unless your playing cards. If its raining then it's going to be very slippery. So you would have to stay in place for a while. And when the rain stops, you still need to be cautios that you don't slip

It says in this article that, Luke had to serve the night watching for animals. Will you get any sleep? Will you fall asleep on the job. What i'm trying to say is you need sleep. I couldn't stay up all night and then stay up all day. I would have to take a nap.

Now the reasons I would join the ship. It says that Luke had fun on the boat, the cowboys played volleyball games. They also had table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,and games also helped pass the time.

If I had the choice to become a Seagoing Cowboy, I wouldn't go. I would miss all my friends and family. And yes you would have a lot of fun but, you couldn't see your friends. You couldn't see the people you wanted to see. And i'm happy where I live and where I go to school. I never want to leave. But for Luke it was something I guess he wanated to do.

Because we are taking animals overseas, there is alot of animals to take care of, like 335 horses, plus we have to have enough hay and oats to feed them. It can be a stinky, dirty job, too. You don't really have to be good with animals, though. You just have be good at remembering and giving them food and water up to three times a day.

When we were't watchig over the animals we got to play different kinds of sports like volleyball, tennis, and baseball. My trip was also very exciting because we got to see different places we have never seen before.

My trip was unbelievable because I got to see places i've never seen before. One of the places I got to go see was the Acropolis. I've never got to see the Acropolis before but now i have seen it in person. Another unbelivable thing I got to do was ride the Gondola ride to Venice, Italy, an city streets with water. The last thing I got to do was vist the excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

The reason my trip was tough was because I got to be a gaurd all night. I chose to be a night they didn't chose me I chose them. The job wasn't so bad, it was tough because I had to make sure the animals were feed three times a day. I also had to watch and make sure that nthing was strange and I had to make sure there was't any invaiders. I also had the job of making sure to tell the captian the weather reports. Not really a hard job, if you like having all the pressure on you its a good job for you.

But before i tell you what i really want to talk about im going to tell you a little about myself. Before i was a Seagoing Cowboy, traveling across oceans! and stuff like that, i was a normal teenager. I was working two part-time jobs,i was working in a grocery store and a bank. When i graduted from highschool, my friend Don Reist invited me on a cattle boat to Europe, i couldnt say no because i knew it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Lets stick to the topic now, being a Seagoing Cowboys is like being a super hero for instance, when you travel on a boat with animals your taking them to safer places. But you weren't just helping animals your also helping people as well.

Have you ever thought about being a Seagoing Cowboy. If you haven't maybe you should. As a Seagoing Cowboy you can help people, animals, and more. Seagoing Cowboys you travel a lot. you travel to places like China, Greece, Europe, and even Venice,Italy. You also take care of animals while shipping. You can feed them and bathe them. There is also lots of sight seeing you get to tour places like excavated castles the Panama canal and more.

In paragraph six Luke had to travel across the Atlantic Ocean for two weeks. He fed and watered the animals two or three times a day. He also had to clean the stalls. He was kept busy on that ship. He was used to being worked all of the tim on his aunt Katie's farm.

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is sometimes dangerous, but fun most of the time. The Seagoing Cowboy program is fun you should try it. ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
0B7067163799,"Luke just got out of high school. He now has two jobs, one at the store the other at a bank. Then out of thin air his friend don ivites him to go on a trip. Don was going to Europe on a cattle boat to help people in ruins from World War II. so Luke thinks, this is a opportunity of a lifetime so he said yes to Don.

So they get on the boat where they are taking 335 horses plus their food. The whole crew takes turn caring for them. There are also nightwatch men who watch the animals through out the night. On one rainy night Luke was the watchman he went to tell the captain his hourly report. After he did he slid down a slippery ladder and landed on his backside. His heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small piece of metal stopped him from going overboard. He was happy to be alive but he could not work for a few days because he had cracked ribs.

He turned 18 on a trip to Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. When his draft board found out that he was on a cattle boat trip they told him to keep doing trips. Lukes most fun times where on the way back from somewhere. Because they had dropped off all of the animals so they could play in the huge place where they had been.

And after all of the adventures he was happy that he had the opportunity to do that it really opened up the world to him.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Luke's claim is its alright to be Seagoing Cowboy is fun but sometimes it just feels good to be still alive after the war. Seagoing cowboys are trying to help other people to get food so they can survive.

The Sea going Cowboys are good for the world because they save people's life.

Luke had made 9 trips over the world and the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Sea going Cowboys ride on cattle-boat so they can go around the world. The Seagoing Cowboys help 44 nations to joind together to make the UNRRA.

My conclusion is people should join the Seagoing Cowboys because they help people and 44 nation joind together to make the UNRRA.The Seagoing Cowboys ended WW2 and they traveled 9 trips with cattle-boat to get around.

49DAFCE2F2C0,"""A cowboy who rode the waves"" is a story where there is so much going on with so many people.

The main character in the story is ""Luke Bomberger"" he works two part-time jobs one at the Grocery Store and the other at the Bank. He has a friend named Don

Reist whom asked Luke to go to Europe with him. They would be riding on a cattle boat with 335 horses only. The reason they had to ride on a cattle boat was because World War 2 just ended and most people animals and buildings got destroyed. They were shipping animals over to Europe so that they could have their animals back. He just turned 18 before they left so he was old enough to help out. Since they had all of the horses he helped out with taking care of them they each had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. He was really good at taking care of all the horses because he used to help out on his aunt's farm with all of the animals. He had trouble sometimes when the storms would be super bad and it would make the boat rock with the bad waves. One time he was going to report back to the captin with the news on how the animals were doing because he was on nightwatch and he slipped and fell off of his ladder. When the boat started tilting he went slididng down the deck of the boat and amost went off board. He didn't go off board luckily because a metal bar stopped him from going two far but he did suffer from broken ribs and have to take some time off. On the trips back to go get more animals the people he was with would play games with him and they also got to see amazing sights on their way there and back sometimes even on the way there is they weren't too busy.

Most of the time this is what happens but his story is really interesting. Most people think it is a horrible idea to do this but I think it's a great one because you get to help people. It is nice to do something like that because most people are less fortunet and things that happened in Europe can happen to them and maybe even you when you don't ever expect it.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

You travel by boat to distant lands and drop animals to those places. My crew would play games on return trips in the empty space on boats. We would play games like vollyball, baseball, table tennis Tournaments, and all sorts there. These are just some of my reasons to join now!

I also got to see alot of things on th trips I went on, nine to be exact. On a trip to China I got to see the great and Marvelous Panama canal! Venice a beatifull city with steets of water was one of my stops. These are sights some only wish on going and wouldn't imagine anyone passing that up! Thats why I'm here, to tell you to join now it changed my mind and it will change yours to. I wish you could see what I saw on my trips, its better than any picture you will ever see of it.

In my conclusion I would like to say it's not without its risks. I almost fell off the ship once but some metal caught me and I wassafe. You also attend the animals on board the ship and clean the Stalls or else it would stink bad. Other than that you have that feeling in you that you made a right choice.

02AA9D6E620C,"It would be good to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it would be a great opportunity to help out, a lot of chances to go sight-seeinng, and would open up a world of awareness.

Firstly, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program would give you the chance to help out. Many countries were left in ruins after World War 2, this program helps though. The Seagoing Cowboys program hires ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals. What better way could you help out.

Participating gives out huge amounts of help that is put to good use.

Second of all, there are lots of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke Bomberger explains, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" Luke, like many others, got plenty of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke went from Europe to China to Greece and even Venice, there are so many places to visit, joining would be the best way to see them.

To add to that, participating would open up a great world of awareness. Joining helps bring about an awareness to people of other countries and their needs. Joining would not only be an amazing adventure, it would help with seeing other peoples point of views and how they need help.

It was a great opportunity, and I got to do so many things that an average small town boy would normally never do.

I met new friends, helped out people and their countries, and got to visit so many amazing places.

I loved that I got to see all the sites.

I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, saw the Acropolis in Greece, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

It was so unbelievably marvolous that I made nine whole trips of exploring and being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times, and the Pacific Ocean twice.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will be able to do everything that I did, maybe even much more.

If you aren't already convinced, with getting to explore and tour many parts of the world, then you should know this.

With joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you get to help people and their countries' needs.

After World War 2 there is a lot to recover from in Europe and many parts of the world.

By joining us and working for the UNRRA you would be helping by taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules being shipped overseas to the needy countries.

If you like animals and don't get sea sick too easy, I say you join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Going on this journey made me more aware of people of their countries and their needs.

It changed me in a wonderful way, and it will do the same to you.

The new friends, exploration, sites to see, and people to take care of is just a few of the reasons to consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

You would be not only helping the needy, but you'd also be helping yourself become a better person.

I said that being a Seagoing cowboy is a heartwarming experience. And there is no doubt about that. While being a Seagoing Cowboy, you ride the seas. And you also tend to animals to keep them well for the trip to other countries. These animals will be given to countries in need from the World War 2. It can really give you a good heartwarminng feeling when you help others. But you don't just give to the countries, you also get to viset them! Besides helping people, you can tour all the different countries that you visit. I got to visit many places like the Panama Canal on my way to China. And I even got to tour and excavated castle in Crete!

As I said in the previous paragraph, you will be working and traveling the world. And even though it is a hard working job and long periods of time on a boat, don't fret! There are a lot of fun activities and games that you can participate in on the ships while you are traveling. And sometimes, you can even play sports! After we took the animals to their destinations, we all played baseball and volley ball games in the empty holds where the animals were previously held. There were differnt games also. There was table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and other games too! But sometimes, I would like to read a book or whittle something. So you will definitely have a fun trip.

So do you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy yet? I bet you do! In this article, I said how it is a heartwarming experience, it's a job full of adventure, and has very fun trips around the world!

I think you should particapate in the seagoing cowboys program. There are many reasons why you should perticipate in this Seagoing Cowboy program. So just keep on reading to see what those reasons are.

I think you should try it out but if you dont right now you might eant to at least reaserching this and see if you would like to try out this seagoing Cowboys program. I think you need to try seagoing Cowboy program beacause in the passage ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" There was a man named Luke Bomberger he loved this program he even experienced going over the Alantic Ocean six-teen times and also went though the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by the World War ll. Would you like to experiance that type of fun.

Also I think you should at least try this beacuse in the passage ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" It states in paragraph two that he helped recover their food supplies, animals , and more , forty-four nations joined together to form an UNRRA (the united Nations Relief and Rehabitstion Administation.) That needed to be recoverdfrom desasters.

I also think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because it states that in paragraph six that you care about animals on the way back from safty. Would you like to save a pour animals life? It states that ""Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship."" It also states that they have to clean the stalls. that would mean that the pour animals need your help because they need more people to help them out with the pour animals with feeding them and also cleanding there stalls.

Third of all I think you need to at lest try this is because of paragraph four it states that when he turend eigh-teen that Luck Bomberger was going to try to go to the miitary service, but when they found out that he was on a cattle-boat trip they said that he should just keep doing what he is already doing. That just by doing that it helped alot so he did not need to searve in the milatery.

Some good reasons to be a seagoing cowgirl/boy is you get to help animals while your traveling over sea. Also its a good experience and you might want to learn about the ocean, thats a good reason to be a seagoing cow girl or boy and you might want to try it out .There might be some big waves but your with animals traveling and helping out thtas important to do .Its also a beautiful ,wonwerful,aventure to explore .

I support Luke becuase he says thats its an one one life oppertunity. It was he got to travel over seas to Europe ,he went pass Greece . He also traveled over the Pacific Ocean twice,and the Artic Ocean 16 times .Its a good aventure and you should try it one day .

You could be on the next boat to be a Seagoing Cowboy of Cowgirl. You may have to do night patroll but it don't matter as long as youhave fun. Maybe even bring a friend so you don't feel so lonely if you don't know anyone.

If you don't like boats then don't do it if you like boats and horses then your the one to apply and we will send you a ticket to get on the boat and be on your way. If you want to see the world or some parts of it then sign up and come join us because we go everywhere you can imagine like China, New Zealand, and Crete. These are just a few of the places that we go to so the horses can get where they need to be. We will go way across the world just to deliver horses.

Luke had no friends when he came other than the friend that asked him to go with him to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Luke made many new friends on the boat. He made 9 (nine) trips all together from that whole career that he had with that job. He had fun and learned new things about boats and horses.

He thought it was going to be a chance of a life time but he changed his mind it being completely amazing better than what he thought it would be for someone like him. His journeys were amazing and he loved it and his family was very proud of him and his friend. He said he is grateful for the opportunity. He also said it made him more aware of people of other countries and there needs.

FF447138621D,"Luke went on the trip to Europe because he wanted to help other. So luke took some time off of work to help the city that had been messed up from World War 2. In the passage it says that,''Luke and Don sign up to help Europe by shiping supply and other goods over sea. luke worked with the (UNRRA) helping with supply. luke and Don were known as a Seagoing Cowboys in the program.

In my opinion luke did the right thing because he's helping other people in other places. In the passag it says that,''In China luke help and took care of animals. Luke went to Greece and brought 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. So luke is helping people,animals,and he is helping with supplys. Luke is travling from sea to sea helping people and working very hard.

So these are my reasons on why I think that luke did the right thing. Also when luke took a trip to help people he also help countries who left in the ruins. In the passage it says that,''It was 1945,World War ll was over in Europe,and many countries were left in ruins. luke and don sign up to help people in those areas.

9215ABF587EB,"In this writing prompt, I will tell you as to why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will explain the duties of this program and the perks and finer points of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In paragraph one, the last sentence, it clearly states why this program is so highly valued. Luke knew this and it states, ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" This is simply an opportunity of a lifetime. In paragraph one, it had stated what Luke did before he became a Seagoing Cowboy. It had changed his life and brought him away from working at odd jobs for the rest of his life.

A second reason as to why this program is extraordinary is that you will be able to make a difference in someone's life. It states in paragraph two, ""...many countries were left in ruins."" This was after WW II. People needed help and, ""The UNRRA hired 'Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.""

Besides helping people, the Seagoing Cowboy program also enabled a golden opportunity for new sights and knowledge. Luke states in paragraph 5, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" You will get to see Greece, Italy, Crete, the Panama Canal, and other spectacular places on your journey across the world.

If you are an animal lover, the Seagoing Cowboys will also provide a wonderful time with the creatures onboard. Horses, mules, cows all need to be taken care of. While this is hard work, it will be worth it.

The Seagoing Cowboys program also provides some fun in the cowboys' lives. In paragraph eight, it says, ""The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."" This program has multiple perks and activities you will discover when you join.

And last of all, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't just an adventure. In the last paragraph, it says in a response for Luke, ""It opened up the world to him."" Luke says, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" This awareness can help you throughout the days of your life. And for Luke, it says, ""That awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and echange visitors for many years.""

In this writing prompt, I have explained why being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience to have. You can help people and animals, have fun, sight-see, and develop your sense of character. you will be able to change your life immeasureably. In the end, the experience can make you into a better, more compassionate person. This concludes the writing prompt for the Seagoing Cowboys. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

It might be a little risky being on that boat in a storm.

A19C0F81B053,"In the article, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" A boy named Luke Bomberger went on an ""adventure"" as an Seagoing Cowboy. There are positive and negative things about the ""adventure."" But, I still think people should try out the Seagoing Cowboy programs, because you you can see many wonderful views and ects.

One reason people should try out the Seagoing Cowboys program is, you can visit many places that you haven't been before like, China, Europe, and ects. Imagine your living in U.S.A right now, and you dream is to go to Europe. Your dream can come true from trying the Seagoing Cowboy programs! Also, places like Europe and China have their own cultures, which are extremely different from U.S.A's culture. According to paragraph 5, it said: ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" So, not only you can visit wonderful places, you can also help people at the same time!

Another reason is, you can play games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and ects. Playing sports is one of the most popular thing to do in the world. When people have fun doing things, it feels like time pass away extremely fast. The adventure may take weeks or even months, but with fun things like these sports, it'll feel short.

Like I said in the first paragraph, you can see many wonderful views. This reason kind of connect to the visiting places that you've never been before, because when you go to a new place, there will be new things you'll see and learn about. Like I said before, most places have different culture. You can find new things or learn something. Some places have different languages to other countries/states. So, maybe you'll learn new languages and you can communicate with people.

These are some reasons why people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It might take a long time to travel, but it'll be fun! There might be chances the participators will get hurt, but what is life withour a few accidents?

Lke Bomberger had participate in this program many times, but he still think it's wonderful. According to paragraph 9, Luke said: ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That represents he think this program is magnificent and fun!    ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Last they are serving for the orginazation of UNRRA. And this people is why you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program.

To support the reason that they get the benifit of seeing Europe and China. They see most of Europe. They see most of China too. And they see what most ordinary people don't get to. This shows why people should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program.

And to support the reason that your serving for the orginazation of UNRRA. They are part of the UNRRA . The UNRRA stands for (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). And so they are helping the debistated countries of Europe and China from world war 2.

Last to support the reason that they are helping others in need of animals from the debistation of world war 2. They are giving people animals. They are also giving people their needs. And from those animals they are getting people the products they need.

And I see why people do not want to join the program. maybe they want to stay with their families, or they get sea sick, or the fact that they just don't like animals.

In conclusion this is why people need to join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program. Like I said, they are sending animals to the countries that were debistated from world war 2.

It may take a long time to get to the destination the ship is going but you could take something along to do or play with the animals. You just have to feed them and clean them or else they are going to get all stinky and unhealthy and the ship will smell bad.

I didn't just go over there for that, I went over there to help. Yes, all those magnificent sights were a blast to see. Yet as an affect of World War ll, there were people with out homes who needed help and food. As a small town boy I only got to have few choices of work, but as a Seagoing Cowboy I went everywhere and got to help people. We helped them by shipping horses, mules, and young cows overseas because they had lost all there animals. While helping I got to sail across the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice. Knowing everytime I sailed across either ocean I was helping someone in need.

Like in the story, To be a Sea Cowboy you have to be willing to travel around the world and also to spread your heart to others and help them. These are some reasons why I think Seagoing Cowboys are so great!

They take over night trips, and even month long trips or Even maybe YEAR long trips to go to people. Now, I do like helping others but if had to take month long trips that would be a nightmare so, their really giving somehting up for others. These people as in the story could just be 18 which is really young and still go out on the open waters for so long. You might think might they die of bordem, well no, because on the there and back they usal have sports like baseball tournments where the animals are staying. They also play ping-pong and foozeball which are table sports. Next, I will tell you about the incredible journeys you go on.

Now, I bet you proably have the world at your fringer tips now cause of devices and I know I sure do.

In the story it mentions them going to Greece and seeing amazing things and also, Luke had turned 18 and could be accepted into the military. Luke had Choosen not to though because, being a SeaCowboy was already enough of an honnor.

The Seacowboy spot was an overall honnor to and it was escpesailly fun. This paragraph will be about some of the animals onboard. The usual was Horses and water/feed, this is another reason you would stay busy on the 1-3 month long trips. Luke says"" The cattle boat trips were an unbeliveible opportunity for a small town boy"". Luke also had other exprinces with animals since he said he had worked on his moms old farm, so if you've every worked you have been a great fit fo the Seacowboys.

Now I have givin you great facts and reasons to join the Seacowboys. You get to see and live in other peoples cultures. You get to travel the earth(Europe and China) mostly those two.

If you want a chance to be able to say you did smething someone dreams of, its now!

This is a one in a life time chance, and if you miss it up, you wil regret it! In some peoples mind, they think that Seagoing isnt usefull, but they are wrong. People also think that all we have to do is work, but thats not true, sometimes we get a chance to look at the beutiful views and feature take, thats always a plesure! Going to Seagoing is much more than an adventure, it's a life time experience. You get to see different aspects and feature, it will blow your mind! You can never get enough of the people, animals, and views! You wil always want to make sure that you have a chance to talk and hang around because people have some pretty cool stories you would never get over!

The reason why I suggest this program for you is because it's associated with helping other pets so you will not be just in it for the adventure or to get out the house you will be helping animals have a better life. Here is a little history on the Seagoing Cowboys.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins, To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Reahabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

One reason I think you should be a seagoing cowboy is to help the nations by giving them more things they need such as food, animals, and more. I think helping the nations by doing this in the war will contribute to them so they could win if I give them the things they need to win the war.

Another reason I think people should join is to have fun. I say that because while you are at sea you could explore different places around the world. While being a seagoing cowboy, I visited places like Europe and China while i was working as a seagoing cowboy. I also went to Greece to see an Acropolis, and I even went to an excavated castle in Crete. When the animals are unloaded you could play many things such as Table-tennis, baseball, volleyball, and many more in the empty holds where the animals were.

In conclusion, i think people should join the seagoing cowboys program because you get to help the nations regain their supplies, and you get to have fun by exploring around the world. You should join because the seagoing cowboys program is fun and helpful to many people.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

If you've ever wanted to do those things, and help a lot of people while doing it, you're Seagoing Cowboy material. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy because of the hard work it teaches, the experience, and because you're supporting other countries, as well as your own!

First of all, we have the grueling hard work to speak of. Some may say that grueling hard work is not a reason to volunteer for something, but I disagree. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is nothing like a normal, boring life. Yes, you have hard work, but you get the greatest sense of satisfaction once you're done. You get to know that all your hard work has gone to helping people in need, and that you've really made a mark on this world. I think hard work is also the path to knowledge, and you may just learn some life lessons along the way.

Secondly, the fantastic experience is what we will cover. Some people may argue that the experience isn't worth risking your life over, but in reality, it's quite the contrary. If you're a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel the world, like I mentioned. You can see places like Greece, Italy, and China. Also, don't forget their unforgetable landmarks that you will see! Not only do you get to travel the world, but this is a once in a lifetime experience! We won't be around forever! Plus, I bet it will make one heck of a story to tell your grandchildren, am I right?

Finally, we have the service you are providing. Some may say you are better off in the military. This may be so, but would you rather be taking lives, or saving them? Plus, us Seagoing Cowboys were only created because of World War II to clean up the mess. Wouldn't it be counterproductive to start a World War III? Here, you get to help people, improve lives, and do good for your country, and the country you're in. I think that with more of us Seagoing Cowboys, we can make the world a better place.

Us Seagoing Cowboys know how to work hard, experienced a once in a lifetime chance, and supported our and many other countries. We've seen Europe, China, Greece, Italy, and even Panama!

907370A98DA5,"I think that they should have more people join/help with the Seagoing Cowboys program.

I think they should have more peoople beacuse then it will incluse having more help instead of having so many animals with not so amny opeople. For example, if you had ten/10 cows and one/1 person then it would be harder . But if you had al least five/5 people helping then you would have half as many which might/would have a big effect on how much more help is nedded/wanted.

What if you put it at a diffrent point/thought. As in, what if those cows and horses were going to little kids? And they were for example going to use them for 4-H because if then would it make other people want to join? For the kids sake? Would you think that would make more people join? More people help? More people to ""get involved""?

I think if we brought it to people's attention that, joining this could possibly ""save an animal"". If you really think about it you could even save a farm, because cows produce milk and some poeple cant even afford milk and thing that you could get from these animals that are in this program. The following problem about the farm.

And a cool part about helping would be you could go overseas if you join the program. And if you have a mind like Luke then, as qouted in this passage "" I would be glad to have this opertunity. And another great benifit out of helping/joining, is as said in the story, ""Table-Tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and alson games to help times to pass by.

""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs"". And if you think about it with this being quoted/said in the passage it could teach people a real lesson about others inneed of others help. So this could be

""Learning Opertunity"". So this is could teach people another reason on how they arent the only ones ineed.

5.22E+16,"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" it gives information about a certain group called the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get to take care of animals for your service to your country in stead of having to be in the military. According to the fourth paragraph when Luke turned eighteen before getting to Greece, he would've had to automatically draft into the military. But, when the draft board learned that he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him to just stay their for his service. Point being if you serve by being a Seagoing Cowboy you wouldn't have to be in the military enless you choose to be in it.

There are many reason's provided in the story to be a Seagoing Cowboy but one that also seems to stick out above some of the others is the sight's you see. According to paragraph five it says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece wasspecial,"" he says.""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."" Which means that if you're a Seagoing Cowboy you get to see a bunch of unique places that most people don't get to see everyday.

For my last reason that I found stated in the text to be a Seagoing Cowboy is it opens up a new world for you. As stated in the text paragraph nine ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him."" which shows that it teaches you and what caring for others does for you and last it shows sights you don't get to see 24/7. To conclude the paragraph being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than seeing things you haven't seen before outside of pictures and going on adventures it's a great learning experience.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get the great delight of caring for others, adventure, sight-seeing, and a great learning experience.

The second reason you should join this Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to have fun on board with other cowboys. Cowboys on board like Luke get to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Other games that cowboys play to pass time is tabble-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

The third reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get to ride the waves on a boat to see the sea. Lots of people love seeing the ocean and riding on it,but this way you just have to join the program and you can ride the seas as much as you like. The ocean is soothing and is just so peaceful compared to the city where it is very load and annoying.

The fourth and most important reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to discover new places and sightseeing. Going to Greece, Europe, China, and many other places seems really fun for seeing new cultures,how people dress, and the landforms. Its good to explore something new and go around the world in this program.

In conclusion,I think the Seagoing Cowboys program is one of the best programs of all time. You get to explore,take care of animals,and have lots of fun with friends. I hope you take this message massivly that joining this program will change the way you think about life today.        ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Since your on a ship for long periods of time, to keep you busy you could play games in empty holds. Some of the games you could play are baseball, volleyball, fencing, or boxing. When playing these games, you can find people who are intersted in the same hobbies you enjoy. The Seagoing Cowboy group is a great way to meet new people and make friends.

The Seagoing boys doesn't just help you make friends, travel the world, but it's much more. It can open up the world to you, so this is why it's so important to some of the people who join.

321557EAD41E,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an amazing thing to do. You get to do all kinds of stuff on the sea. You get to do stuff you don't even think of doing. Here are some reasons why I think you should join us and become a Seagoing Cowboy.

One of my reasons why I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is because you get to have so much fun on the boat or other places you stop. You get to help animals, find new people, and when you drop the animals off at the location, you can even play games in the stalls where they were held. Another fun thing you get to do while being a Seagoing Cowboy is going over-seas. Going over-seas is an awesome experience. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice.

The second reason I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is, because of the sightseeing. When you see those amazing sculptures or ruins of what you know what they were, you can take pictures in your head and tell people stories of what yoiu saw. A couple of the sights that I got to see were, the Acropolis in Greece, I got to see China, and I also got to see Europe. Seeing these things changed my life completely.

My last but certainly not least reason is that you get to be with animals the whole ride. Sure they ""cost"" some responsibility but they can be fun to play with. Animals are amazing creatures and getting to spend along time with them will make you never wanna let go. When you're on the ship, and you're heading to your destination, you can sometimes get lonesome. But don't forget you have animals to keep you not bored and get your responsibility up.

Seagoing Cowboys are amazing jobs that you can do. Even if you don't like adventures this is still an amazing job. People need more adventures so if you're olne of those peopled, join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
C75FA9AF0A57,"The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" Program.

Luke's participation in the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program allows him to experience adventures and visit many unique places. I think many of you should join this program. Here are my reasons why you should join this program: you can save someone,you get a nice experience by traveling to different countries, and when your done doing your job you can hangout with the other cowboys.

My first reason is that you can save someone. You can save a life since the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program is all about taking care of horses,young cows, and mules ,and shipping them overseas to other countries to help people out. Luke knew if he signed up he can help rescue people in trouble. Think about it for a second. You can also help save someone who has suffered because of the war.

My second reason is that you can get a unique experience. Have you ever wanted to travel to China or Europe? Well you can if you join this program since the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" program travels to many places to ship animals. Luke got to experience China,Europe, but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to him. Luke also taked a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. You can get a one of a kind experience from this.

My third reason is that when you are done with your job you can just relax. Also you can go play with the other cowboys sports in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Luke had found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. It is not all about doing work there is some fun in it too.

In conclusion, these are my reasons on why you should join this program. You can get a good experience if you join this program. Bieng a Seagoing Copwboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world for him. ""I am grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" he says. That awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students, and exchange visitors for many years.

I have been a SeagoingCowboy for nine years and I am still facinated at all the places we go to.

Whould you like to be a SeagoingCowboy its a lot of fun and I forgot to tell you also get to feed the farm animals. It's a very long sail but it's worth the seightseeing. The night watch is like a job you have to check on the animals every hour to make sure their okay. But the night watch could be scary one time I fell and cracked my ribs.

There are also some fun things you can do on the ship once you drop of the animals. When you returning from dropping of the animals you can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Ping-Pong tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped pass time on the boat.

The animals on the ship were pigs, sheep, chickens, cows, roosters, horses, and goats. The most liked animal was the horses because they were nice and the fur was very soft. Every time at night you could here the animals for a litlle then they would finaly settle down.

Also,you would help needy people that are in need food or water during your trip.

Firstly,you would have to learn how to take care of the animals on the boat. Seagoing Cowboys take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. The animals would have to be fed and watered three times a day. You would also have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. Personally, I love taking care of all the animals on the ship because they are very nice and friendly.

Next, another great thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is you can travel to many different parts of countries. For example, I had made nine trips to distinct countries. While you are in these places, you`ll get to have free time and explore the villages better. One of my favorite places that I got a chance to go to was in Crete where I toured an excavated castle on my way to China. You might also get to got to exciting places like this if you apply for the job.

Lastly, during your free time on the trip, you might want to stop by and help the people that are on the streets in need of food or water.

For example,I helped out countries with gaining food supplies,animals,and more. We had to take care of the animals such as horses,young cows,and the mules that were all shipped by sea.

Besides helping people from around the world I had the benefit of seeing diffrent countries,such as Europe and China. But to me seeing the Acropolis in Greece was especially special.

And I was grateful for seeing all of that.

There are also many things that can keep you busy. I know what really kept me busy,caring for all the animals. They all had to fed,at the most two to three times a day. Also bales of hay and huge bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship. And the stalls all had to be cleaned.

If you think that was hard work...don't worry! Life as a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all hard working. I still had fun doing it! I played games with my pals,we played all sorts of them.

Another good thing about it is that you can travel around the world and the states like if there are more animals do in need because they are in danger and almost extinct!

The best part is that you go out around the world and help out everything and if you are in the news for that and the people see that you were on the news with all of you friends then they might as well congratulat you.

Once they see that people can do that to world then they might want to join because they to. When you around the world that means you might go to Asia and a lot of places that were very good in need like China,Japan,Mexico,Australia, and the best for helping out animals is probably Antartica.

People might say wow that bad because it's really cold there and that Therese really nothing we can do there but there is. You can help the endanger Penguins and sea lions that are there and bring more food for them and ever since the globe warming went up Antartica is slowly melting but then getting more snow but the heat are killing penguins. Maybe go to the polar and save some Narwhals or some other animals like polar bears.

So go around the world helping Elaphants,Penguns and also rhinos or just a lot of animals and other counterinsurgency that are helping animals and build more thing for them like China and the pandas and make more cities or homes for the homeless.

And plus maybe going around in the snow helping animals in the Polar or Antartica Isent so bad and helping out others with water and food and re building things for countries and that means you are doing something good for the world to.

8DD596F5F5B5,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy is fun! My friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe in a cattle boat. It sounded fun, the chance to travel around the world and go see places I've dreamed about. I mean how could you pass up an offer like that? So, of couse I said yes. It was 1945, World War II had just ended in Europe, and countries needed help recovering from the war. To help these countries recover more than 44 countries joined together to make the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or the UNRRA. This program hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" (that's what I was) to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules while the animals were on the ship. Don and I signed up of couse it sounded fun, and I had helped my Aunt Katie on her farm when I was a boy so I has some exspirence. Finally we received our orders to report to New Orleans, I couldn't wait to go out and help people. We had arrived on August 14, that's the day the Pacific war had ended. When we got our seaman's papers we boarded to SS Charles W. Wooster, we were heading to Greece, I was so excited. In cargo we had 335 horses plus enough oats and hay to feed of the horses.

I had turned 18 before I had arrivede at Gresse, so that meant I could be drafted for military service, but when my draft board had leanred I was on a cattle-boat trip be just told me to keep doing what I was doing. In the service you help people and help to fight for your country and if he told me to keep doing what I was doing that means I'm doing something that is going to help people in a big way. The cargo is going to help feed people in need because of the war destroying their food supplies. Not only did I help people, I also got to see Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Also taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy was amazing too! The city with streets of water was beautiful. I also go to tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

On theses trips I got to meet new people and see new places. I got to help people in need, and that felt good. It feels good when you see someone that's suffering because their home was destroyed and when you help them they have a smile on their face. Taking care of the cattle, horses, and mules was fun. We also found the time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after all the animals had been unloaded. Us cowboys played baseball and volleyball in the empty hold where the animals were housed. We had table-tennis tournaments, boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and games aslo helped us pass the time.

There are so many opertunities when you're a Seagoing Cowboy. ""It opened up the world to me."" ""It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.""

B8D49BD571C2,"I think that people should participate in the 'Seagoing Cowboys', because you will learn things, know things, and see things that are new to you. You would also be very amuzed by half of the things you see, such as long ago history buildings, and even musumes. This event that you will take, will open the world up to you. It will show you how other people do things, and how they get treated.

If I had the chance to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy' I would take the chance, because there is so many opportunities that you will take such as lifetime events. You would see things and stuff that you probally have never seen before, I would love to see Europe an Africa. Like Luke went to a castle that was most likely beautiful and amazing. It would also be a good family trip or good friends trip, if you went with one of them.

Many people are instrested in history so it would be a good trip full of amuzed things. You also could probally visit the history building, were special events took place. People would even ask you to try or do something and that would also be a lifetime event that you always wanted to do. Most people don't like doing this stuff because it 'takes to long to get there' or something, but like i keep saying, it's a lifetime event that you would want to take because maybe you will never be able to do it again, but you can atleast tell people you have been there. While you are there enjoying them places, take pictures so you will always remember that moment, they say if you take a picture it will last longer.

In this story that i just wrote, it tells you good reasons to take the chance of becoming a 'Seagoing Cowboy' .The fact that it would be so amazing and cool, and it once a again, a lifetime event. I would like you to think about what you would see and adventure while you are going adventuring to these amazing places, or maybe you don't want too, I would still like for you to think about that. So, for now on I want you to think about what i told you, and think about becoming one.                     ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

If you like helping people this is the program for you.

In this program you will be able to travel the world to help people in the other countries.

For example , A war is going on and they need medical or food help than you can go over and help those people in need of those things.

If your going to travel by ship Luke found the time to have some fun on board so maybe you can too.

The ship will feed you and give you a bed to sleep-in.

Luke said``It made me more aware of people of other contries and thier needs``.There are lots of reasons to be a part of this program.

Also you have jobs on the ship like cleaning up the ship or getting the food ready for the other people on board to eat. Also on the ship you may run into a storm so the crew will determan how bad the storm is , and if the storm is to bad you will have to go inside till the storm clears.

Then when you arive in the country that is in need you do what they need like getting a water suply or getting food for the people or getting the medical care the people need need and if you dont believe me than just ask Luke.

Then when you are don with what that contry needs then you can get back in/on the ship or waggon you came on than you can leave and return home and wait for the next country that needs.

In the passage they talk about me and my adventures although breaking my ribs wasn't so plesant . In this passage

I will tell you what I think IF more people would have joined the UNRRA program.

I think that joining the UNRRA( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation

UNRRA about hiring ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of young horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas. UNRRA was formed to help Eroupe and many countries that were left in ruins by World War ll,to help these countries recover their food supplies , animals, and more .

In August 1945, I had recived orders to report to New Orleans. The day I arived was the day the Pacific war had ended.

I got seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W.Wooster, heading to Greece with cargo of 335 horses im addition enough hay and oats to feed them . My birthday had passed before arriving to Greece I had turned 18 which meant I could be drafted to military service . By the time I it was 1947 I had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

I got to see many new and cool things on my trips . In the passage it tells what I got to see on my trips in the passage it tells "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing

Europe and china . but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, he says . So was taking the a gondola ride in

Venice, Italy , a streets of water."" I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama

Canal on my way to China.

I had so much fun and it was an exsperience of a lifetime besides the picking after the animals and breaking a few bones ,but it was all worth it, and I bet so many people would enjoy it as well as I did .

19798292EC06,"Do you ever have a yearning to have an experience where you help people, and see new places? I had one of those eye-opening trips myself when I took part in being a Seagoing Cowboy. All citizens should participate in this program. In this essay, I will explain why this program should include you in the next trip overseas.

When having deep affection for men and women who have served in wars such as World War Two, you long to give help back to them in repayment. That is why it feels so amazing to sail overseas with vital needs for discouraged people, such as animals or food. I have served for nine trips(the longest contributed by any Seagoing Cowboy), because it gives yourself satisfaction to keep youself busy with activities that lift people's spirits. If you join this program, you can feel like a warrior in different ways.

On these trips overseas, you can also live through rewarding and beautiful sites. With our free time in other countries, we had the opprotunities to see the Acropolis in Greece, and parts of China. We also got to experience what a gondola ride in Italy felt like through streets of water. Visualizing these historic places really make you want to see more of the world, and keep helping our world's health.

People opposed to the UNRRA may have many doubts why you would risk the danger and time. It is true that you sail where destructive and gruesome battles have taken place, but you can visualize the importance of why you need to help those citizens who have lost so much. Even though some may also state that it is too much scrificed time away from home, the time goes by fast while playing fun and relaxing games such as:fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and tennis tournaments. There are many reasons why you can make up for risks and sacrifices on this trip to pass time or feel more connected to your service.

Becuase of the ways this trip is so benificial to participants, it is a great program to take part in. Seeing beautiful sites and repaying soldiers help you analyze so much more about other places and war. For many people, it concludes as an opprotunity of a lifetime, that will never be forgotten. For these reasons, all citizens should participate in the UNRRA program overseas.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Being part of the Seagoing Cowboys, you can have lots of fun. You can find unique ways to spend your time, because the Seagoing Cowboys have to go on some pretty long trips.

You can even have a table-tennis tournament, and many more other types of games. It's sure to make it feel like time is going by quicker.

It's not all fun and games, though. You also will have to care for the animals. You must make sure you feed and water them two or three times a day. You need to make sure that you will also have enough food and water for the animals, and the people on board. You have to make sure the animals' stalls are clean, too. But, doing this can also keep you busy, and if you like to care for animals, then this could also be very fun. You will have to try and stay safe too, and make sure other people on board are safe, as well. Just try not to fall off the cattle boat. It's not that hard. You will have to be extra careful if you have to serve as a night watchman. You will have to check on all the animals every hour and report to the captain.

There are many reason to be one such as not be put in the war, sight seeing, and sports with other people on board. Also you get payed watch and feed animals which is not that bad.

When I was on the boat was saeled to Greece. By the I turned 18 which ment that I would be drafted. Sence I was a sea cowboy I was told to continue me work on board. This is only the lest exieting part of my jurny.

On my trip I saw many different monumaets and struckchers. For example the Acropolis in Greece. I also saw the parts of Italy and china. Seeing places like the Panama Canal is one plasure of being a sea cowboy, but what would I do on the waters.

On the waters I played games. Even with the boat rocking we played games like table-tennis tournaments. We also played other games such as fenceing, boxing, and baseball in some of the empty holds. If you are not a sports person the you could also read.

Over all being a sea cowboy is a great job with may plasures of game, sightseeing, and no war. Even though it might be hard and tiering work it is worth the try.             ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

In this essay I will be covincing you to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will talk about how you get to see the world, go site seeing, and get to have fun but also help your country.

First off, seeing the world. in the story I talked about how besides helping people I got to see the breath taking view of Europe and China but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was just beautiful. I also traveled across the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States. Now who wouldn't want to see the world like I did and still help people in need?

Next, site seeing. On my journey to help, I got to take a gondola ( a boat) ride in Venice, Italy a city with sreets of water. Wouldn't it be amazing to go on a gondola and to go explore Italy? Also,I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Is'nt that just amazing?

Last but not least, what is a Seagoing Cowboy? I can't persuade you to be one if I don't tell you what it is! A Seagoing Cowboy takes care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas . Don and I signed up. When we were Seagoing Cowboys it was 1945 when World War 2 was over in Europe. We helped countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you like helping people this would be a great job for you.

Number two is that I get to help people who were affected by war. I was eighteen when I joined the orginization, so that meant I could be drafted for war at any time. This made me feel me feel worried, but then I went to Greece and I every thing was okay. Now enough about me I am here to encourage you to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

You should join the program. It feels great to know that you are making a difference in somebody's life. Plus, like I said there are a lot of cool sights to see. I have been to nine different places. I saw something amazing in each place out of the nine. You can try all new different things. Like new food, new music, new sports, new almost everything. Now I know what you are thinking that is crazy how am I supposted to adjust to something so quickly that is impossible, but trust me it is not as hard as is sounds. If your still not hooked (which I don't know why you wouldn't be) it can be a lot of fun.

I think that people should join this because of internatinal travel to help people across the globe. Also if you are a Farmer this job would be perfect because you would know exactly what to do with the animals that are being taken to another country to help the people that had lost a lot to the World War 2. This program could teach you what to do if you would want to be a Farmer.

The cattle-boat trip is an unbelieavable opportunity for a small town boy.

This job can be dangeris because a crew member almost when over board injering his ribs. This job can also be fun because you get to play games in the livestock stalls and tour different cityies.

Maybe even collect some cool items you find on the ship or even souvenirs from other states , countries and villages . You can also see cool statue like Statue of Liberty if we ever go to New York again . Once I got to tour an excavated castle in Crete .

Second reason you should join cowboys club is you can meet new people , and make new friends . In many countries,states and villages there are different people like in age , race , and language. While rest stoping in villages some families don't have as much so you should give respect and show them you come with peace . While your in certain places you can learn different cultures , religions , tradition .

According to the story our boat carrys animals because UNRRA hired us too . Taking care of animals isn't hard at all , feed them , clean them , clean there pens , and that's it three easy steps . Some animals might be pregnant so we will have to double feed them and watch them for signs of birth. The baby's will be easy to take care of most of the time because they will stay with there mothers for 4 weeks then separate them .

Joinging the sea going Cowboys will be the best choice you make . You can go on fun trips learn stuff culturals from countries,city and states . Maybe learn some different languages along the way .

82B3EF9D143D,"Luke wanted everybody, including himself, to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program beacause he wanted to help the countries that they were going to. He wanted to help the countries recover their food supplies, animals and more. There would be 44 nations that would join up together to help the countries in need that they were going to.

In August 1945, they recived their orders to report to New Orleans. They had 335 horses in the cargo plus enough hay and oats to feed them. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. They were caring for the animals during the crossings. Luke said,""Besides helping the people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.""

You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because there are countries that are in need. What if our countrie didn't have food supplies, or animals, or other things that we need to survive. If we helped their countries when their in need, then they would help our countrie if we were in need. That wouldn't be good if we won't share what we have that they dont have.

If we don't help the countries that are in need, then we might have another war because they would be angry at the countries that have all the things that they don't have. Also what if there were terrible storms that would wipe out all the people that don't have shelter in that countrie. See we have shelter that would protect us from dangerous storms and we also have money to repair what the storm did. But they dont have any money to buy shelter. They also don't have any food to eat, but we do.

One reason to join is that the Seagoing Cowboys can help you learn responsibility. As mentioned in paragragh six it states, the animals had to be fed two to three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. This shows that it takes responsibility because you have to make sure you feed and clean the animal's pens regularly so they won't get sick or die.

The second reason you should join the Seaging Cowboys is because it will let you have an opportunity that you might have never gotten. As mentioned in paragraph five it states, ""Besides helping people, Luke had the side benefit of seeing Greece and China."" This shows that you can see and do things you might have never done before.

As some claim, the trip is very long and dangerous. Yes, this may be true, however table-tennis tournaments fencing, boxing, rading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Another thing is that you can help people and make someone happy. Don't you just love the joy you get when you help someone in need? Well you can have that feeling all the time if you volunteer because you are always helping people in need by giving them animals to eat.

For the record, you can see amazing monuments and other amazing things by just volunteering. You get to see these things for free because you have to go to some places like how I saw the Acropolis and I took a grondola ride so that was fun.

Something else is that you can get out of the drafts. I know because when I was on the ship, Iturned 18 and they said to keep going for my service and so that made me happy.

I hope by the end of the argument you will be so convinced and enthusiastic about joing the Seagoing Cowboys program as much as I was!

The most amazing place that I have ever visited was probably Greece. I found Greece to be the best because there were so may fantastic ruins and buildings that the Ancient Greece built thousands of years before my time. The Acropolis was a very beautiful sight to see because you could tell that the builders had done a great job of building it, so that it would last a long time. I could proboby write all day about Greece, but I want to share some of the other wonderful sights I got to experience along the journey.

The gondola in Venice,Italy was acculay pretty fun to ride. Seeing the Italian buildings accualy was neat site to visit. You could relaxing on the gondola trying to learn Italian. Venice had kind people, so if you think that you would be mistreated because you're a foreigner, you're wrong. In europe the people are kind and generous to everyone. Going t differnt places might be a klittle nearve wreaking, but after about two trips you'll get used to it, and that's what you'll want to do. The Seagoing Cowboys not only lets you travel, but also learn different languages, meet new people, experience differnt jobs, and so much more. I'm not going to spoil all the fun of being a Seagoing Cowboy beause I want you to fell exitement when you hopefully want to become one. I did miss my family, but the job and traveling kept me very busy and aware of what life was like.

The best part of all was giving a little homeless boy in China some clothes and food. That boy was the sweetest child I've ever seen in my whole life. seeing him with a big smile gave me a better future. tha smile and journey with the Seagoing Cowboys was amazing. I hope you will pariceipate with the Seagoing Cowboys because it will change your life. Joing them was the best deciosn of my life.

After World War two, 44 nations came together to form the UNRRA(the United Ntions Reliaf and Rehabliitation Administration). They needed people to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Thats when the Seagoing Cowboys began. Also, thats when Luke and Don signed up. Here is why they did.

Luke and Don signed up because it was an opportunity of a lifetime. It maybe a liftime opportuntiy for you. You could see cool things just how Don and Luke saw Acropolis in Greece , Europe and China, and taking a gondala ride in Venice, Italy. It opened a world to Luke. It also made him aware of people in need. You would love the oppportunits that it would give, just like it did to Luke. You could meet families thats just like yours but they need help and Seagoing Cowboys would be able to help them.

Taking care of animals and seeing great countries is a good reason to go be Seagoing Cowboy. You could go on great adventures and see things you never imangined seeing. You should be a Seagoing Cowboy to help people in need and take care of animals. The world is so big and a lot of people need help. Sign up to be a Seagoing Cow boy.

F48EF80D2ED3,"There are many programs in the world around you. I know one certain program that I personaly love and think you would too. This program is called the Seagoing Cowboys. I think you should join it because there is so many sights that we can see on our ways across oceans on boat trips, it's an opportunity to work hard, and it's fun.

The first reason I think you would enjoy this program is because there is so many sights to be seen. I saw many sights. I saw the excavated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I also, took a ride on a Gondola in Vencie, Italy a city with streets of water. Like I said these are all wonderfull sights you could see. There is one sight I think was the most special and that was the Acropolis in Greece. Europe and China are a couple other sights. The boat trips do take a while though. For example, it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States, and a month to get to China. These are many sights that make this program super enteresting and fun.

The next reason I think you should join this program is because it's an opportunity to work hard and show others what we can do. There are many opportunities to do, expecially if you are on the cattle boat. Some of the things to do are, caring for animals, and makeing sure they have been fed and watered, pullying bags of oates and bales of hay from the lower holds of the ship to the upper, and cleaning the stalls. These many things were hard work.

cleaning the stalls was every night and the animals had to be checked daily and nightly to make sure none of them were hurt and fed and watered properly. All of these responsabillities are hard work.

Just because there's hard work dosen't mean theres not any fun, because there is. once the animals and cargo are all dropped off there is time to have fun on board, The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Tabletennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. As I said before there are many things to do fun it's not always just seriousness. There is time to goof around and have fun too .

Like I had said before, there are many reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join this program because there are so many sights to see on boat trips, it's an opportunity to work hard, and there's time to have fun. I hope this makes you want to join this program because it's a good time to shine. Well, not really shine but, you know what I mean.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

He was working at two part time jobs, one of the jobs were grocery store and the other one was the bank. Then, Lukes friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to the cattle boat in Europe. Luke couldnt say no because that has always been Lukes dream. Then he thought, that would be the opportunity of his lifetime to work on the cattle boat!

The reason Luke wanted to work onthe cattle boat was because the World War II just got done in Europe. He also wanted to help Europe get there food supplies, animals, and familys back together. Fourty-Four nations joined in on this program. The name of the program was called ""Seagoing Cows"" because they took care of the horses, young calfs, mules that were on there way over seas. Europe needed despirate help when this incident happened.

Acording to the story, on August 1945, they arrived on August 14th. On that day the Pacific War ended. They had a cargo with 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them. Luke turned 18 when he was onthe cattle boat headed towrds Greece, and that meant he could be drafted to the military services! By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke Bomberger had made nine trips, then he got told that he had the most Seagoing Cowboys trips in the program!

Luke always said ""the cattle-boat trips were so unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy!"" Besides helping people Luke had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis was very special, Luke said. He enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up his world to help people and be kind and helpful to people who need help.

In paragraph 4 it said that

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which ment he could be drafted for military service.

""When my drafy board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service.""

By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

""When I started playing football a lot of peoel thought i wasnt gonna be able to do it and they though that i would get hurt and break a bone and not even be on the field as much as i wanted.

You just have to show them what you can do and prove it to them.

I am a very brave man that decided to do the job that I am doing now becuase its kind of like the story in the bible. There are a bunch of animals in a boat on water, floating across the sea. There are many bad things that could happen that you might not even see coming from a mile away. The job that I am doing now is a VERY risky job that not a lot of pepole are brave enough to do for them selfs. You have to be very tallented and brave to walk over here and get on a boat not knowing what is gonna happen.

To be one of there people you have to be physicaly and mentaly prepared for what is coming your way, you can never tell what is gonna happen in the future so you alawys have to be prepared for it. Luke probably had a lot of bad things that happened to him like when there was a bad storm one night and he was climbing the ladder to get to the captin and he slipped and fell and broke som of his ribs. If you think that that is bad then when you get into the job you better be prepared be a lot more sever things can happen to you while you are on that boat, you might never be able to tell what is coming your way.

2400C8B565F1,"Being a Seagoing Cow is great way to get to know and see more things about other countries. In this draft I will talk about why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. When you become a Seagoing Cowboy you are helping others and at the same time you are having fun. When you arrive at your destination you are not only delivering goods but you are seeing many amazing buildings, landmarks, statues, and more.

Being a seagoing cowboy is hard work but it is for the greater good, as in helping others during World War Two. A way to start can be by getting offered by a friend or offering a friend. After the War, people in different countries needed supplies, and fast, so a Seagoing Cowboy could get the jobs done. Making the world a better place is a good thing to do. Plus when you do so you feel good that you have done something that has helped others.

When you are done dropping off your load you have a lot of extra time on the way back so you can play games like table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fensing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass the time. Traveling all around the world can show you that a lot of countries are in need of food and help.

It will take a while to cross the sea to where you are going, and if you have animals on the ship you have to feed almost all animals two or three times a day. Ypu have to be up for the hard work of cleaning animal stalls, feeding animals, night shift watching, and more.

I hope you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy, and enjoyed the draft. That's what I have to say about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy and why you should become one.       ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
83B5900BCB8E,"There are many reasons why others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. They will experience unique adventures, beautiful countries and cities, and will have the chance to care for and grow closer to God's magnificent animals, like I did.

The first reason to sign up for this program is that they will experience unique adventures. These may include meeting new friends, trying new foods from different culters, spending weeks on the bright blue sea, and roaming around new places. I had a great time seeing and doing all of those things while I was a Seagoing Cowboy.

Another reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy is the ability to discover beautiful new countries and cities. They could see mysterious English castles, eat delicious European foods,sail across long, flowing rivers through France, smell many different plants and animals in Asia, and much more! It would be an experience of a lifetime and all their friends back home would be jealous of their trips.

Last but certainly not least, the new Seagoing Cowboys would have the chance to work with amazing animals! If they love hard-working animals like these, this job is for them. They get to take care and feed these magnificent animals such as horses, cows, donkeys, and mules that would be taken to the countries that are in need which they would be headed to. They can have fun and help others at the same time!

In conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would be tons of fun and knowledgeable, too. I would definitly recomend it. They would have a blast experiencing unique adventures, sightseeing in beautiful countries and cities, and caring for the wonderful animals God put on this earth for us.

AE291ADFAC8D,"Did you ever wonder what getting sea sick feels like? Well in this prompt I going to talk about a guy named Luke who wants to covince people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Well I think people shouldn't join the Seagoing Cowboys Program because of getting sea sick, maybe getting lost, or even dying.

First, getting sea sick. People who get sea sick probaly die of the disease or even get really sick. I can infer this is the number one reason for not going on boats people came up with.

Secondly, maybe getting lost in the ocean. Lots of people had this problem before but maybe not today. People can die or even just end up somewhere away from their families at home awaiting for their arrival. I can infer this happend alot to people who forgot which way to go to land.

Last, dying. This has happend because of either disease faling off the ship and being stranded or even starvation or drought. Another reason is because of other people attacking them. I can infer this happened often to people who did not pay attention to where they were going or to anything

To conclude this essay I'm going to list the three main reasons I thought not to join the Seagoing Cowboys program one getting sea sick, secondly getting lost, or even dying. Would you still join this program after you read this paper?",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Im glad i was there with my friend or I wouldn't of made it, because he kept me going. Finnaly I suggest everyone try out being Seagoing Cowboys.

During my first trip I left August 14 1945 with cows, goats, supplies, and weaponry. It was a dangerous trip but we kept pushing because the army needed supplies. When we arrived the Pacific war ended but another was still blazing. The old war ended in ruins and bodys.

The UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabitation Administration) created this idea of taking supplies over seas. Many didn't sign up, but me and Don did and turns out it was alot of fun. On the return we played alot of sailing games to pass time. when we delieved the supplies there were no animals in the ship so we had time to setup thing like whittling, table-tennis, and boxing, but theres alot more, like fencing.

The sights in Europe are amazing there's China and The Great Wall of China. In Greece theres the Acropolis. I also took a gondala to Venic, Italy. I also toured a castle in Crete. Finnaly I marvelled at the watery canels in Panama. In the end i saw alot of crazy things in Europe and China.

After my trip I can say it was amazing and you can have the same experience. Just sign up for Seagoing Cowboys. There's animals so if you like animals there on the boat.

When I got there and started doing what i was suppost to do I started enjoying it.

Another reason is that when I went their I got to explore the acropolis in Greece and it was beautiful I think you would like it to. I also got a ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy.

Imagine always being out in the seas where theirs beautiful scenery. Imagine actually looking foward to helping animals and hear the noises of the wind blowing you across the Atlantic Ocean on a boat. Well thats what Luke Bomberger had to look forward to everyday. Its called being a '""Seagoing Cowboy"". Here are some reasons why you should become a seagoing cowboy. First, Seagoing Cowboys take care of horses,cows, and mule that are shipped here. Second, caring for animal keeps you busy. Lastly, on free time cowboys play fun games like baseball.

Some people think that being a seagoing cowboy is boring but most people think its pretty cool. when you take care of horses, cows, and mule it actually teaches you some life lessons like what to exactly do with those exotic animals.

Caring for animals is time consuming it takes up a ton of your free time but its all worth every single bit of you're time to learn from it.

When cowboys play fun games its usually at times when the animals have been unloaded off the ship and when everything has been cleaned and ready for more animals.

From attending to every need of the animal and letting horses,cows,and mule fill your free time to. Later playing a game on the ship when you did all that work it really makes you hapy and ready for more challenges that life gives you.

It was 1945 and World War two had just ended and the UNRRA joined together and helped the coutries to recover from the war. UNNRA hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the cattle that were shipped over seas. Don and I signed up to do this position. In August we got orders to go to New Orleans. I had 335 horses that I had to take care of.

After about two weeks we finally arrived, but caring for the animals kept me busy.

They had to be fed and watered at least two or three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be dragged from the lower holds of the ship and the stalls had to be cleaned out. I had helped out at my aunt? farm when I was younger but I was not prepared for the dangers on the sea. On my second trip I was going to go make my hourly report to the captain and I slid down a slippery ladder. A small metal strip had stopped me from going into the dark atlantic, but I was not able to work for a couple days because my ribs were cracked.

This job kept me very busy, and had many oppertunities to see things I have never seen before. I halso had found some times that I could have fun on board instead of having to care for the animals. After the animals would be dropped off we would head back. We played all kinds of activites and games. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball in empty places were the animals were. We also had table-tennis tournoments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, the games had help pass time.

I encourage ever teenager if you have an opputunity, to sign up for this job. This job I was able to see things I had never seen, it was a lifetime experience, and I was able to stay busy with the animals and then have a little fun. I encourage this job because this is what I did it was an enjoyable jod. I mean how cool is it to ride a ship and take care of cattle.

We also get breaks. We get to go sightseeing and do things that other cultures do. The job can be hurtful. If there is a storm, the boat will get slippery and you can fall. I almost fell over board once. It was scary.

You should get this job because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Plus, the animals are well behaved and they would love to have new people. If you love to go see places in other countries, you should get this job. If you want hard work, this job would be perfect. In your free time, you can play games, read, or whittle something.

I have been to so many wonderful places like Greece , China , Panama and Europe . Imagine if you could get the chance to go there, would you say yes to the opportunity?

You don't just get to see beautiful landmarks but you also get to help people who's homes , cities and towns were destroyed and left in ruins. To them , for helping there homes recover you would be a hero . You can take care of animals when you are on seas . Those animals are shipped to the people who's homes were destroyed .

Thats not just what you do on the job you also get to mentally help yourself . I saw the poor families that lost almost everything during World War II . You will understand that you are lucky enough to have a strong and protective country that protects you from enemies . It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years .

You really won't find it boring because Don Reist and I came up with thing to do during trips. For example we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed after they were unloaded .

7DDC0463AE26,"This story is about Luke Bomberger a boy who rode the waves had no idea that his life would change soon after his graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and at a bank when his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no he knew it would be an opportunity for him. It was 1945,world war 2 was over in Europe and countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover 44 nations came together and started UNRRA {The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration}. UNRRA hired seagoimg cowboys to take care of the horses,young cows, and the mules.

The first reason to join the program is because they came together and started a group of 44 nations to help Europe. They hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to help the animals. They are trying to get the nation back together. Luke and Don signed up for it to. Heading over seas in August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived ''August 14,'' Luke sayed,the day the Pacific war ended.''

The second reason you should join the group is because '' The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' he said.''Besides helping people, had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,'' he says. ''So was taking a Gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water.'' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china.

The third reason why you should join the group is cause caring for the animals during the crossings kept luke busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hayand bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared luke for hard work.

In conclusion I think you can still help with or without an reward.

D43B2FB63A90,"Joining the Seagoing Cowboys group was one of the most greatest accomplishments I have ever made. If you choose to do something in your life, it should be becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. I have some very good points on why you should join.

The first and main reason is this program helps people. It supports people's horses, young cows, and mules, since this program is for those who are struck by natural disasters or for wars that have taken place where they live. It also supports the animals living space. The cowboys must feed and water the animals 2 to 3 times a day, the men have to haul oats and hay from the lower holds of the ship, and they have to clean the animals stalls.

the second reason is that if you turn 18 while on a Seagoing trip and you get drafted, this counts as your service to the military.

The last reason is when you are going to these countries you have these gorgeous and unique places to visit and sightsee. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the streets of Italy from the lake on a gondola ride, and I have even seen the Panama Canal on my way to China.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy then you can experience and support all three of these reasons.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

When the animals are getting unloaded you can play games like baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals are being housed. There is also many other games like fencing, reading, boxing, and table-tennis to make the time go faster. The opportunity has made me aware of the suffering and hardships in other countrys. Why can't it do the same for you?

This opportunity is not all fun though. Once on one of my16 trips there where 335 horses and the hay and oats to feed them. All of the animals need to be watered 2 or 3 times a day so you can not get lazy! Stall have to be cleaned too!

If you get a great opportunity like this, do not back down! It may be an advencure just waiting to happen!

Show the people in need that you do care for them! ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

It really helped me in life. You get to see cool things. You can relax. Then sometimes there a lot of work involved. Anyone could be interested if they tried.

The article says there is a lot of war like things involved as well. It gets pretty dirty and rough to be a seagoing cowboy. I would suggest doing because it gives you oppertunities, and soemtimes it can be fun. You can't be weak and not willing to do work though. There is a lot of training to go through and it is not easy. So if your a hard working worker this is the place for you to be.

Then there are some severe injuries or even worse. You got to be tough though. I have a good time though. Beside the work, but sometimes it can be fun. You have company as well to cheer you up when your down. Some work you have to do is cleaning, feeding the animals, or even pulling or pushing heavy objects. Like in the article it said the animals have to be fed or watered two or three times a day.

Yet all the work there is fun. Like seeing all of the awesome landscapes or cities. If you feel down this will bring you up. Watching the sun set. Being with workers that are kind. There is more and more. It is just what kind of person you are. If you are a hard worker and like to see cool things. This is the place for you. It is really fun if you can see how it is fun to help people and animals. L hope this inspires you to be a seagoing cowboy. The program is great.

The text states that he was grateful for the oppotunity.

It also stated that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

The passage says that the awareness stayed with him.

Why he is convincing others is because he is trying to say that this trip will open the world to you and make you relize other peoples needs in different coutries.

Three reasons for joining the Seagoing Cowboys are that the Seagoing Cowboys help people affected by wars, the Seagoing Cowboys get to see many amazing places, and the Seagoing Cowboys have much fun on their journeys.

Most importantly, the Seagoing Cowboys save lives. The ""Cowboys"" take trips with many animals, and all of the supplies to take care of these animals. When the animals arrive at their destination, they are given away to hungry families.

346534F6D93C,"Luke's point of view is that other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. One reason is because you get to go to different places. Another reason is because Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with Katie.

You get to go to different places like Greece, and by time he got to Greece he was 18 years old that meant that he could draft for military service. Then he could see Europe and China. They crossed the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossing kept luke busy. They had to feed and water them two to three times a day. The stalls had to be cleaned.

Luke was already for this because he worked on a farm with aunt Katie's farm as a boy had perpared Luke for hard work but not the dangers at the sea. He had different jobs each time. The second time he was a watchman. And his job was to check the animals every hour.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke. It had opened the world to him. But he was greatful for the opportunity. It made him more aware of of people of other countries and their needs. And the awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

That is why Luke's point of view for people to participate in the Seagoing Cow boys. And I think that it would be good for people to do what he did that way you get to go to different places that you may of not been to before. And that way you get to see what it's like on the sea taking care of all the animals and all of the jobs that you have to do.

It would be cool if people would do what Luke did that way you get a learning time where you get to see what it was like for Luke and do what he did I think that it would be cool I we did that. And If we did what he did I think that it would be fun takeing care of the animals and on a sea ride and going to different places that are in different countries to see what there life is like and how they eat and things like that would be cool.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

For one, if you are an animal lover you get a chance to help the animals on the cattle boat. As it says in the text, ""On his second trip, Luke seved as a night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour.""

The second reason is that even though you are serving around the world you still get to go sight seeing. In paragraph five it says, "" Luke also toured an exavated castle in Crete and maveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.""

The third reason is that you get to be of sevice around the world to help countries after World War II. In the story it says, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, forty-four nations joined together to form UNRRA (The United Stations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation).""

6F7FB6CD2C11,"Have you ever wanted to go to the other side of the world? As a Seagoing cowboy you can do that and much more. You can see sights and learn about them. You learn about hard work and how to do different things. You can have fun while doing a job. Last, you get to help others who have less then you. If you like this stuff then this is the job for you.

One cool thing about being a Seagoing cowboy is that you get to see a lot of cool sights. You can travel to different parts of the world. In the article it talks about how Luke went to China, Greece, and other parts of Europe. Another thing about the sights is that you can learn new stuff about the places you see. Also you can meet new people and maybe even talk with them. Last, you can have your friends come with you and you can see the sights with them and enjoy both. The sights are great but what you learn is also great.

There are lots of things to learn on a cattle boat. One thing about being a Seagoing cowboy is that you learn about hard work. Like in the article it talks about Luke's aunt Katie and her farm that he worked on and how that prepared him for the hard work on the cattle boat. One thing that will help you learn hard work is caring for the animals on the boat. So when you come home your parents will be happy that you learned what hard work is so they can trust you with different things. Another thing you on a cattle boat is doing your share of work, because if you are not doing your share of work then your crew mates are going to get mad fast. Being on a cattle boat also keeps you busy so you can stay out of trouble in school or at home. All the stuff that you learn is good, but everyone wants to have some fun while doing a job.

Another reason that you should go on a cattle boat is that it is fun. No one wants to do something that is not fun. On the way back you get to play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. You can also read or whittle if you would rather do that. It also says in the article that Luke had fun on board the ship especially when they were returning. It is good to do a job that is fun to you, but also do a job that helps others and not your selve.

One last reason you should go on the trip is that it opens up your eyes to all the people who could use our help in the world. Like helping people who could use the food from the animals that you are bringing over or they could use the money that they would make by selling the animal. Like in the article it talks about Luke and how it opened up the world to him by saying ""I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

These reasons that I have given you show why you should work on a cattle boat. You will see great sights, understand about hard work, you get to enjoy it while doing a job, and you get to help out the world by the way Luke did. So why would you pass up the chance of doing all those things by becoming a Seagoing cowboy?   ",5,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

People might aslo say the that what if people attack you on the boat while sailing. You would be able to protect the animals and you because the U.S. wouldn't send you without any protection.

Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowboys program to teach what Luke does when he is a seagoing cowboy.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when he is a seagoing cowboy he ahd to take care of animals when he was a seagoing cowboy, such as a horse and a cow.

I think others would join Lukes program because he is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

If you like animals this would be a good job for you, if you like sailing it would be a good job for you, and most of all is you need something to do and would enjoy sailing with animals this is the perfect thing for you.

To join the Seagoing cowboys you don't even have to be qualified, infact I didn't even know about it until my friend asked me if I wanted to come. My friend Don Reist invited my to travel to Europe on a cattle boat. So, really you don't need a big flashy degree or really anything at all to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you love animals you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. As a Seagoing Cowboy you get to spend a lot of time with a lot of animals. The day the Pacific war ended I set out on my first trip, which was to Greece with 335 horses, and if you like spending a lot of time with animals, it takes two weeks to cross the pacific, and to go to China it'll take a month. So, if you enjoy to spend time with animals you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to have a lot of fun and do a lot of site-seeing. As a Seagoing Cowboy I always found a way to have fun. We would have baseball and volleyball games, we would have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, we would even enjoy boxing, reading, and even whittling. And to top it all off we saw a lot of amazing sites. We would go all over Europe and China. I have personally visited Greece, China, seen the Panama Canal, and have even toured an excavated castle in Crete. Even though there might be long excruciating trips, we still find ways to have fun.

There are many upsides of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I have only told you a few of the many, many advantages of being a Seagoing Cowboy. So, after all of this I hope you consider joining me on the high seas. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
E63C7CCB5726,"In world war 2 the UNRRA hired the ""seagoing cowboys"" to take care of animals such as cows,horses,mules and other animals.

Now if you ike animals and want to take care of them on certain occations then join the seagoing cowboys.""The cattle-boat trips were unbelieveable for a kid"" Luke said.

They travel alot and they see alot of places and travling can be sometimes intresting and fun.

It doesnt take that long to get to these places ethier, it only takes about a month because they are on a boat.

Now some people think thats long but it's really not.

They got to china from somewhere in the atlantic ocean in a month.

Not to long right.

The cowboys go to places for jobs and then the play games or go siteseeing its not all just work they have a ton of fun.

The cowboys liked to have fun too.

After unloading the animals they play baseball,volleyball,table tennis,and they read and box.

This can give you great oppertunities as an adult and a kid.

Some of it wont be fun you will have cetain jobs, but sometimes it's better to do hard work instead of play. From what ive said so far are you intrested?

Some of the jobs are even fun and majestic.

If your a watchmen you get a majstic site of what your around.

If theres danger your going to be the hero because you would warn your team about everything that is going on and tell them to turn around.

In some of these jobs you get to work with anaimals and that could be fun because you really dont do alot of work.

The most you have to do in that job is clean the animals and feed them thats it.

Now to me being a seagoing cowboy sounds like an awsome and fun job.     ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
DE29B1ED3EFC,"Hello there! I'm Luke. What do you want to be when you grow up? A farmer? A surgeon? How about a Seagoing Cowboy? No, it's not a job where you ride seahorses with a Cowboy hat (Although that would be awesome). Being a Seagoing Cowboy meant a lot to me, and if you are a young boy in hopes of helping those in need in this war, it is the job for you! So here are reasons why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

First of all, Seagoing Cowboys help countries ruined by WWII by taking care of horses, young cattle, and mules taken overseas to them by us. In a way, you not only help that broken country, but you are helping the U.S. When you help us help another country, they will most likely help us back, forming alliance for war purposes. So you not only help them, but us as well!

Last year in 1947, as a young boy, went on many great adventures to amazing places. Along with helping people, I also went to places like an ancient Greek acropolis, Venice, Italy to ride a gondola, and ancient China, where I excavated a ruined castle. Along with helping those in need, I also got to admire the great Parthenon, or see the Panama Canal. These places are only a small handful you get to go to as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Along with the sights, you get to travel the open ocean. If you are an ocean person, you probably want to become a Seagoing Cowboy. Traveling the sea is an amazing experience, as seing unexplored islands, the galaxy at night, and sparkling blue water is quite a life-changer. Rarely did I ever see a storm out on the Atlantic, so no worries there.

Overall, being a Seagoing Cowboy is the job of a lifetime. I remember doing all these things, and I still do them today! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a way to forget about WWII, and see the world as a peaceful place again. With the right training, this job can help you see the beauty in this fine world. So if you want to forget about war, and help those in need, see extraordinary sights, and travel the sea, then join us! I'll sea you on the high seas!",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

If you like helping people the Seagoing Cowboys program because what they would do is that during World War II they would give some counties that were in World War II food, supplies, animals, and more.

If you want to know the name of the group it is UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabiltation Administration).I know it is long and hard to remeber but if you join for your freetime you can traval to cool places around the world. The best part is that 44 nations will join.

Another reason why you should join the Seragoing Cowboys program if you like animals you should go becase the UNRRA will be sending animals over seas on a boat to counties that are over seas. Second is you want to make freinds when you there cause there are going to have a lot of people that you can make freinds with.

He toured castles and took fun rides on rivers or canals. He got to interact with animals to and from the places he went to. He also ofcourse got to interact with the people of these far away lands.

Now it's not just a bunch of fun and games. You have to do a lot of work. You would have many farm animals to take care of. Horses,cows,pigs,and goats. They need to be groomed,fed,watered,and watched over. Sometimes you'd have to stay up all night to watch over the animals.

I'm not saying you won't have any time to yourself on the boat. when you go to pick up the animals you can read,play baseball,or tennis in a lower deck or you could take long cat naps.

5E73014A8454,"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Most people think that all you do is work, like taking care of animals. However, there are ways for you to have fun while working. You can play games, read a book, or even see cool sights. Here are a couple of things you could do.

First of all, you can see many different sights and explore while traveling. I know that I have visited some really cool places, like seeing an excavated castle in Crete. You can also see many different things. You could see the beautiful, wavy water or see a beautiful sunset while you travel. Another place I think you should visit is the Panama Canal. So, if you ever get bored and don't anything else to do, you should some beautiful sights and marvelous places. You may never know what you see and even make new friends along the way.

Second of all, you could play games if you get bored. The Seagoing Cowboys program isn't just all about working for animals. It's about having fun and playing games. For example, I know when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, we would play games, like table tennis, baseball, and even volleyball. You could also read too, if you would like. Where would you play these games, you ask? Back then, we would play in the empty holes where the animals have been housed.

Third of all, you could just have fun. You could read a book, play games, or even relax. Talk to the animals while you take care of them. If all you do is work and no fun, then you are going to not like being part of the Seagoing Cowboys. I remember when I did do a lot of fun stuff, but I had to do work first. I would like to tell you a very good story. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down the steps, but luckily I made it okay. I just couldn't work a couple of days because

I had cracked ribs. Trust me on this point. If you say to people that you had a great time, they would probably want to join too.

In conclusion, I made very good and understanding points. First, go visit some sights and places while you explore. Not only could you explore new worlds, but you could also meet new people and try out different languages. Second of all, you could play games. If you play games like volleyball and baseball, you will be more happier when you play games that if you just do work all the time and not have any fun. You will get bored and most likely not enjoy yourself all that much. Third of all, have fun. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for these reasons.

Well why not be both with our Seagoing Cowboys program. I did it and it chaged my life forever.

You can enjoy being the best of both worlds while helping others.

It may be dangerous, but so is everything else. People need us, but we need you to help us.

You may wonder why should I help people I don't know? here are some of the things I saw and did that you will be able to do too.

You can see many parts of the world like China or Europe.

Also you may see Acropolis in greece or take a gondola ride in Venice.

Maybe even Italy with sreets of water, or Creete with its Panama Canal.

Also if you are 18 or older this counts as military service, and when it comes down to it it's more safe to deliver suplies on a boat than be in the battle lines of war.

Plus You are helping people around the world by delivering important suplies like horses, young cows, and mules. Though you will have to feed alot of horses you'll be ok. I fed 335 horses and I was ok.

In concusion that is why you should be a seagoing cowboy. You will see parts of the world you never seen before, you'll be serving your country, and you will help people around the world.

It causes the workes to feel happy when they see the smile on the peoples faces they help. The Seagiong programe opened up the world for the workes. It showed them their is more to life than what they see during their normal ways of living. The workes got to see Gods creation in other places like Itly and their excavated castles.

There are three reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. The reasons are one its a good way to help out others, two its a good opportunity to see the world, and three you are litterally saving people lifes and dont even know it yet.

Reason one is becasue the job is just a really nice way to help out those around you. You can help the enviroment by replacing animals and even buildings. You help out the poeple that werent as lucky as you. Some people could be suffering out there in the cold, but you helped them rebuild their houses,and rebuild their lifes. Poeple will be greatful for your kindness.

Another thing i noticed was that It gives you a good oddortunity to see the world. Luke

Got to see a bunch of beatiful things on his way to other countries. He Got to see things from New Orleans. To China. He got to see things you wouldnt normaly see just going through your normal life. You have the chance to see stunning things if you were a Seagoing Cowboy.

Last but not least. The Last thing i noticed was that you are litterally saving poeple's life. Poeple could be out their starving and you could be the one to fix it. Some poeple would rather just care for their own family, but you have to power to give poeple food. They will have homes to sleep in becasue of you. Poeple will be snuggled in beds at night becasue you choose or not if you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

When my friend Don Reist gave me this chance, I went for it and now I would like to give you the same chance that he gave me. Exploring this vast world, helping your country and others, and facing the sea with new friends by your side are all things we do.

This world is big and changing each day. You may not get to go to Greece or Venice on a regular day basis, but being a Seagoing Cowboy opens your eyes to the true beauty in the world. I have gone to Venice, The Acropolis in Greece and the Panama Canal on my way to China. Traveling the sea shows you beauty and it honors your country and others.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is no picnic, but it is a true service to your country and other countries as well. After World War II countries were in ruins and in need of supplies. Seagoing Cowboys meet their needs because we bring them animals they may need , food they need and so much more. We serve the 44 different countries that formed the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaion Administration). We not only serve our countries, we face the sea with new friends by our side.

The sea may come across as fish, beaches, sun, dolphins and fun, but it is actually much more dangerous than you may think.

When it was my first time for the nightwatch it was hard because it was raining, the deck was so slippery that I almost got knocked overboard,but the small metal strip kept me from from going of the edge. I was lucky to be alive, but I didn't work for a while because I cracked my ribs. This may all sound bad ,but the sea isn't all seasickness, sharks and cracked ribs either. We know how to have relax because after the supplies are dropped off we have some fun like; playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and more games helped us have fun on board our ship.

In conclusion, the sea is full of fun, pain, service, and exploration. I sincerly hope after this you choose to be a Seagoing Cowboy because that is one thing you will never forget. The chance of a life time, to be a cowboy who rode the waves.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
ABE4228EB3FF,"I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you could explore alot of things.

The reason I think people should participate in this program is because you get to go on vacations and you almost get to explore around the world. You also are crossing the Atlantic Ocean and also going to China. It also seems like a fun activity because in paragraph nine it says that Luke was grateful for the opportunity. In paragraph five it also says that he toured and excavated castle's while he was on his way to China. You had to do a little work to because its says in paragraph seven during the crossings it kept Luke busy and he had to check the animals every hour. I also believe it is alot of traveling because in the introduction it says that Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean more than 16 times. In paragraph nine it also talks about how he felt much more than just an adventure for Luke. In paragraph four its says that they knew he was a cattle-boat trip but they told him just to keep doing it for his service.

There is also many other different things to do if you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy and I think Luke really enjoyed it because in paragraph seven it says that Luke was happy to be alive. Also on Luke's second trip he served as a night watchman but he couldn't work for a couple of days because he cracked his ribs.

5AF8EE583A33,"Do you think the seagoing cowboys is a good job? Well I do and here are some reasons why. You can spend lots of time with diffrent animals you can also spend alot of time out on the clear sunny ocean, and most of important of all you are helping people. When you are out on the ocean you can have alot of fun and join very easily. To think of it I joined just from my freind inviting me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Spending alot of time with different animals on a ship is amazing. You get to feed, take care, and have alot of fun with them. Taking care of those young cows and mules can be alot of fun they can sometimes be funny and they can comfort you. Imagine if there was a really bad storm you will always have to cows and mules to keep you company. Would'nt you love being around lots of anmals?

When you get taken over seas to help people it feels good to know you are helping people in need. What if you were those people who needed help to get your countrie recovered from a bombing? You would want somebody or someone to help you recover. This is another reason why you should come and join the seagoing cowboys you can be someone who helps people in need of your assistance.

31FF4480A205,"If you like to be with animals such as horses than we would sure have a fun time on the SS Charles W. Wooster. We have to help the animals that are being shiped over seas like horses, cattle, and mules.

When we aren't caring for the animals then we are out site seeing or playing games on the boat. In the empty stals the horese, cattle, and mules aren't in we play games like baceball and volleyball they had table tennis tournaments, fencing tournaments, boxing tournaments, they read, and other games that would help pass the time.

This could be a danger if you aren't careful, one time it was raining and I was on nightwatch then I fell and a strip o melat stoped me from falling overboard. I couldn't work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs from me hitting them of the strip of metal.

But it is not all fun and games so if you like hard word you would love the job of being a Seagoing Cowboy, we have to clean out the stalls the horses and cattle and mules were in and that stinks litterily. We have to carry huge bags of oats and other food for the animals, and boy does my back hurt,whew.

The stalls where the horses were kept also had to be cleaned. Not only do you learn to take care of the animals but you also learn responsibility.

Secondly, you have a lot of fun. I get that some people think being stuck in a boat isn't fun at all. Some of the most fun was when the animals were unloaded so the return is one of the funnest parts. The cowboys played many games and sports where the animals were housed. They would have volleyball games, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, all which helped pass time. Go try it, who doesnt like an advanture, and some new friends?

Lastly, you get to experience so many unique places. I understand that some people might not want to leave their home. But, I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. Another one of the coolest things was the Acropolis in Greece. I got to do many things like taking a gondola ride in Venice, Itay a city with streets of water. I saw many things and went to lots of places just imagen everywhere you could go and everything you would discover if you gave it a chance.

Well did you get anyone said the head of the Seagoing Cowboys. We have a total of twenty people so far taht said they were. Finally we have people because if were going to go across seas to help ship animals we will need alot more people. Where is our next place over seas. It's in Europe and they have a big hawl.

Then when it came time all of them came right in and sat down, so it was my que. Thank you for coming everyone. Today I will be talking about my experiance with the Seagoing Coboys and how I think it's the best thing that ever happend to me. First of I just graduated from highschool and then I got invited to this trip over seas on a cattle boat, and I knew that I would never do that in my life so I said yes. Then when we got over seas I got involved with this program, and my job was to keep everything at night going good. This would include the ship and the animals. But, one night it was very stormy and I slipped and hit the side of the boat and broke many ribs. Which stopped me for doing anything for the next couple of days.

But, there were other fun things to see and to do accros the sea. Like baseball and volleyball because when the ship was unloaded there was alot of free space. Also, when you were shipping things you got to see alot of cool and exiting places. But, my favorite part was having the experiance to do things over seas and working with animals, and our next hawl is Europe so sign up now!",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
CA956C31EF82,"I think many people would love doing the seagoing cowboys program. If you are a country type of person or even a city person you could still do it. I am about to tell a few reasons you should do it. Here are some If you like animals, if you like exploring, if you want money, and even if you like to try new things, this would be a great thing for you.

the first reason is if like animals you would love this job. We take care of cattle. You get to feed them, brush them, clean their stall, and even lead them off the boat. You have to take care of almost 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them.

Also if you like to explore the world around you this would be a good opportunity to do so. We have visited Europe, China, and other places. I seen the Acropolis in Greece, I took a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the panama Canal on my way to China. There are some other reasons to join the program.

Another reason is you could get paid. You could get payed by the trip or you can get paid every hour. I do not know how you get paid or how much you get paid. All I know is if you want money then join this program.

The Second to last reason you might like this is because we travel far distances. If you like to travel you should do this. It took me and my crew about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Even if you do not like long distance trips caring for the animals will keep you busy.

The last reason is we can still have fun by playing games in our spare time. Me and my crew play Volleyball, Baseball. Table-Tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

I hope you read this and thought it through. I am glad you took time to read this, and hope to see you on one of my trips. We will have fun orking with the animals together. Hope to see you There!!!   ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

2B37596BD9A5,"I think that boys should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Because during this trip you get to go place that you have never been before, take care of animals, and not only work but you get to play games and sports.

One thing that I did on my aventure was I went and saw Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and Marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys half to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Once I had to get on the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

Plus in the spare time the cowboys (us) played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the other games also helped pass the time.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an aventure.

But it opened up the world to me.

I'm so grateful for the opportunit, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. The awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years.

All of the things that I got to see, do, and play you could to. But the most important thing is that if you join the program then you get to help with things that are important. So what do you say will you join? Or will you stay at home and not help and see the world like I did? But just so you know this is a once and a life time experience.

27837D0F399E,"I was a Seagoing Cowboy. I help feed the horses that are getting tranported to Europe. I remember that one time I tried to convince some other people to join the program. It didn't go so well.

""I don't like the sea air"", ""I hate the ocean"", "" I can't swim"", ""What we get tropedoed? I can't swim"", I have allergies to horses"". These are exuses I get when I try to convince other people to join the progam I am in. I did convince some, but not a lot. Most think that I am a creep. They try to get away from me. I am always sad when I see them walk away, but at least I tried. Eventuly I gave up trying to convince them.

So here I am, on the sea, thinking about the people that I tried to get them to join. Every time that I thought about them, I think about what they are doing right now. When I was discharged, I went off to find every single one of the people and tell about my journys. They always say the same thing. ""I wish I joined the program.""

C2758D58392E,"Luke Bomberger did'nt get to visit many places around the world and see things he may have wanted to see because he never had anytime to. He was always buisy trying to help people with banking and shopping with in his home town. Really what he didn't know was that he was going to be helping all kinds of people around the world a long ways from his town. So when Don Reist invited him to go he knew that was a chance to really help other people and get more money.

Luke Bomberger knew that he could visit lots of places. He actually got to visit a,""castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China"". He got to do things he would'nt have been able to do in his old town. After World War ll in 1945, lots of people were left with nothing and did'nt have food to care for everyone. So with the help of the,""Seagoing Cowboys"",they would help transport animals to those places so they could have food to live.

I think more people should join this program because it gives others a chance to live and survive after wild events like wars. Many people in the world work as doctors and vets for those who live around them. But they also have the chance to help people far away who need it. Not only that but they can still work with animals. It may not be dogs and cats they are working with but they can still help animals and other people.

Luke enjoyed being apart of the program because he knew he had the chance to visit many polular places. So I think that instead of planning a vaction to go the beach you can go other places that you may not have been to before rather than going to the same places everytime. When you think of being someone that transports animals across seas you don't normally think of being a doctor. But really what people don't think about is that when they give animals to people the animals are recorce for food which helps people that may be sick or need to food because they don't have animals near. So its important to everyone.

Really the big idea to this program is that people reliey on animals and their recorces. But its very hard for people to have to leave there town to find food and bring that back for everyone. So this program is very important to others because they know people will care for them when they need it. It's also very good education when you visit places like unwealthy towns so you can get a feel of what it's like for them and how much they need people like us. After all Its important to care for others.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

I would go because it would be an amazing adventure. You would learn so many things that you would normaly not learn as an average high school student. World War 2 just ended in Europe. You want to see the aftermath of some of the cities are.

Every city that he stopped at, he could go to a cool muesuem or go somewhere amazing in that city. Every 18 year old would rather go to Greece than staying at school working on worksheets. Luke and Don got to take care of animals. They also took care of people who didn't have a lot of advantages.

AC84213A7FB4,"The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program, but being one is better. The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can ""open someones eyes"" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Seagoing Cowboys are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, he almost fell off because he was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked his ribs on the ship, he didn't quit, he kept being a Seagoing Cowboy, and continued to help the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys care more about the animals than they do themselves, and that is great.

He has done so many things to help the people in need of desperate help. Seagoing Cowboys help others, have to take care of animals, and people who join get to travel often.

First, this program helps others who are in need of help. Some may say, neighbors in their neighborhood could help them. However, some of the people the program has helped were just in a feirce war, you can't even tell it was once a beautiful neighborhood. The progam helped people in Europe just after World War II. I belive the program is really thoughtful, even to people in other countries.

Secondly, the program takes care of animals. Others may believe, they don't need to take care of the animals to help the humans. On the other hand, the animals provide meat, milk, and eggs. The animals will also provide clothing to the humans, the sheep give them wool. I infer animals are really useful animals and good to take care of.

Lastly, people who join travel often. Others may say, you might get injured with all the wars going on. However, most people who go arrive after the war ends so saftey is not a problem. The only time you might get hurt is when you mess around on the ship. This shows, traveling is not a problem, unless you get seasick.

The Seagoing Cowboys program helps others, take care of animals, and they get to travel often.

3CB7F7FC1F29,"Why should you join the Seagoing Cowboys program? There are many different reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Some of the reasons you should join I am about to tell you.

The first you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is so you could help people over seas and in other countries. A boy named Luke Bomberger got to do all of the things that you could be able to do, by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The next reason you should join the program, is that you could get to see many unique places all over the world. A lot of people do not get to see some of the things that you could be able to see during the Seagoing Cowboys program. After the animals are unloaded and you have some free time, you could so site seeing and do all of it for free! Luke Bomberger got to do this while visiting many different countries for free. Now that is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that you could travel all over the world for free! That is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You don't get to travel to places for free very often. Luke Bomberger had the chance to go to many different countries and see many different things in those countries.

The fourth reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program; is that when you are in the different countries and you have freetime over in those places, is that you can meet people and learn their about cutures. Luke got to go see and meet new people during his free time while people were still unloading the animals, and probably learned new things about those peoples cultures too.

One of the other reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that you can learn a lot of survival skills on the ships that you are on. If you ever are a capatin of a ship in the Seagoing Cowboys program or in any program, is that you will already know how to control a ship, keep your ship members in order, and know what to do when you are on that ship. Luke Bomberger got to learn a few things on how to contol a ship and what to do when a storm hits and you sail right through the storm.

The sixth reason that you should join the program is that you could meet new people on the ship and get to know them. A lot of people do not have friends or just want to be more social. A way you could do that is by joining the program. After all of the animals are unloaded and you are heading back to your home to pick up more animals, you could play games with some of your ship members. Luke Bomberger got to meet new people and probably made some new friends while on some of those trips, even though he already had a friend that was going with him on the ships and things.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you can spend a lot of time with animals. After you are finished with the program, and you need to find a job, you could open a new farm and already know how to take care of most of your animals. When Luke was on the ship he already knew how to take care of the animals but he probable go to learn new things on how to take care of them.

Those are the reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You get to help people, see unique places, you could travel all ofver the world, you get to learn about peoples cultures, you can learn a alot of survival skills, you can meet new people on the ship and make friends, and you get to learn a lot about animals and how to take care of them.

Luke's heart was pounding when he was going feet first into an opening side of the ship ,but a small thing of metal along the edge stopped him sliding. Luke was very happy that he was alive, but he could not work for a little bit because of cracked ribs. Luke's job is scary sometimes but most of the time it was an adventure for him. Luke said that this program ""made me more aware of people of other countries in needs.""

The awareness stayed with Luke leading his family members to host a lot of international students for many years.",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
8FE4938C5EB1,"Seagoing Cowboys aren't like pirates, or like land cowboys that rob people and do aweful things. They help out people when they are recovering from the terrible things that hitler and World War II brought them. When you sign, up you don't have to risk doing army time and going to fight becasue when you are a seagoing cowboy, it counts for your service time. Also, you get to see the world and how other people are living and how cultural our world is. In this essay I will tell you reason why is I know I did the right thing by sighning up to be a seagoing cowboy, and why you should sign up too!

The most important thing that I was able to do was to help out my community and beyond. When people were suffering from traumatic losses and hunger I was able to help heard and bring animals to the Jews, Germans, and Aisans that were all suffering from the outcome of the war. They were in poverty and were in need of people to safely get livestock to them so they could eat and be whole again. I think that by sighing up you get that sense of heroism and you know that you did a good deed. I think that by also sighning up it really helps life or death problems.

When I sighned up I knew that I would have to go fight for my country and maybe even die in battle. So, I turned 18 during my first trip and I knew I would have to stop what I was doing and to go serve in the army. But, when I went to go speak with the army, they said that helping to bring food to families wounded in the war counted as War time. I overjoyeced becasue I loved to do what I was doing and I didn't want to have to end that. Also because I didn't have to risk dying! Phew, thankgoodness! So thats why you should also sighn up so you don't have to go out and get shot! I also realized how big of an oppertunity it was and how much of the world I was going to be able to see.

The cattle-boat trips where an unbelievable oppertunity for a small-town boy like me! I had the benifit of sight seeing Europe and China. I saw the acropolis in Greece, and took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, with streets of water! Water people, I mean who would pass that oppertunity up? I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and awed at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Grece was very speacial, and China was amazing! When you take the chance of going out and doing things in the world you get see magnificent things. Even when your traveling between countries, you get to experiance marine life and biology!

See? That's the thrill of it all, that you get to be a real hero, not die, and see the world through your own two eyes! Now people might say that you don't get to see everything and you need to ""die for your country."" Don't listen to them, they are just being cynical. You make the decisions and you don't need one bad review to change how you feel about doing something! People might just judge you, but guess what they are just jealious that you get to see the world and be a true hero. That is why you should sign up to be a sea-cowboy. You never know where tomorrow will take you! I'm going to try to immitate Uncle Sam now, We need YOU to be a seagoing cowboy!",5,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

617D56A15483,"Do you want to go on daily trips and help people in war strucken countries?

Well you might want to become a ""Cowboy"" who ""Rides the Waves.""

My name is Luke and I'm here to tell you why you should become a ""Wave-rider""

I think you should become a cowboy who rides the waves because you get to help different people in different countries.

You get to have a little experience going on your record.

When you become a cowboy you feel a sense of civic participation and recognition for what you are doing.

Here at UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) we dedicate our lives to helping people.

Here's the benifit of why you should join, you get to go on daily trips to distant countries and meet new people. Evidence from the text that supports my claim is, "" 'Besides helping people, I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,' he says.

'So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.'

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china.""

You can also do fun things on the ship that you are on while you are sailing.

Some things that you can do on the ship are, baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the games also helped pass time.

Information from the text that supports my answer is, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.""

In conclusion you should become a ""wave-riding"" cowboy because you feel a sense on appreciation and you are doing huge favors for other countries.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
DE5C69D05106,"If I were Luke Bomberger I would convince people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it's such an experince.

When you are doing your job not only are you working, you are helping other people and it gives you that good feeling down inside. As you are doing you rounds or trips or whatever you want to call it is a great opertunity for a young boy or grown man to see alsorts of stuff, like different cultures and different countrys. Another reason is your an animal lover you got yourself a job but remember one thing you do need to be strong and tuff. If you are worried about being board trust me we have loads of stuff to help you pass time some of the stuff includes, Table tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games so you dont half to worried about being bored.

There are some great dangers about being on sea. On my second trip I served as a watchman . My jod was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night I was makeing my hourly report to the captin and I slid down the slipery ladder and landed on my back side. I was happey to be alive. The one problem was that I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs. You shouldent have that problem.

Well thats realy all I can say. Yes I agree it dose have its downfalls but thers more good things than bad I can personley tell you that. It realy helped me open my mind to the world. It helped me understand the problems other countries were facing and I realy hope it helps you open up your mind. With all my information I hope to see you at sea helping the animals.

The first reason I thing you should join is we get to see all kinds of things on the boat. Like one time I got to see an excavated castle in Crete and I also marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. The reason I joined is because it is a one in a life time thing. You don't get to see castles every day or the Panama Canal.

When we drop off some of the animals we use some of there stales to play games in and we play like vollyball, and baseball, and table tennis tournaments. We also do boxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and it is a fun time on the boat.

One time when I was on one of my nine trips more then anyone I was a watchman and I was checking all the crates like I normaly do , but that night it was raining so I reported the news with the captian. Everything was good and I was coming down the ladder and I slipped down my back side and my heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide and that strip of metled saved me from falling over board. I could not work for a couple of days because of some cracked ribs, but I was happy to be alive.

This opened up the world to me. I'm gratefull for this opportunity and I hope you join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is a one in a life time chance.

Many contries were destroyed and grew weak. Europe was effected by it the most.

The seagoing cowboys helped many of these contries rebuild there animal, economy, and farms.

World War II destroyed 15 diffrent contries.

Many of the contries lost lots of thier crops and farms. Without thier farms they can't get food or vegitables.

The Seagoing Cowboys bring Horses and cows and other live staocks to these contries.

They give theses cntries an extra boost in growing back there farms.

The Seagoing Cowboys program takes ordinary ranchers and bring them and horse cows and other livestock and bring them to other contries.

They also bring hay and feed so they can feed them while they are on the boat.

While you are at the contries you are allowed to visit some sites on you free time.

So while you work you can alway plan your next trip. Stated in paragraph 5 it talks about the benifets of traveling to all these diffrent places.

You get sea-sick well take a bag because this is a good job and im sure it pays good, because you know on a boat with stinky animals. All you'd have to do is clean thier pens give them food and water and i'm sure bathe them. See? Simple job. Besides like Luke had an opurtunity of a life time getting to see so many places. What now? Oh you dont like the ocean well then...

Buy a pool and let your imagination play out. It's not that hard right? Why would you argue about a job when you can: A. See the world, B. Do little work, and C.Help others.

I even got to see Europe, China, Greece, Italy and more.

It made me aware on other countries and their needs. It was also fun to be on board. I got to play table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games that passed time.

The first reason why I think you should join is because you get to help people. Going to those different countries made it so much more clear of their needs. Their country was left in ruins. They need everything that we do or more.

The second reason why you should join the program is because you get to take care of animals. When I got asigned to that job it kind of reminded me of my aunt Katie's farm. I would go over there when I was a boy and help out.

The last reason I think you should join the program is because you get to travel! Yeah there are some dangers like when the captain slide down a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs but the sights make up for it. I remeber when I got to see Europe and China, so pretty. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece and that topped it all.

That's why I think whoever is reading this should join the program and become a Seagoing Cowboy. You get to help people, see the world, and take care of loving animals. Just think maybe you'll see me there.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Evidence from the passage to support my answer is the author talked about what Luke did as a seagoing cowboy. Another peice of evidence from the story to support my conclusion is it was World War II and it happened in Europe duing that time so Luke helped his friend out and helped him with saving people with food and money and also, a shelter. These peices of evidence supports my conclusion by being stated in the text.

It gave me a lot of good life examples that i can look back on which is always good. Thats one of the resoins i think more people should go though it.

I think other people should do it because you get to see a lot of places. Like besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special. Thats only one of the many benefits of being in the program.

Another reson i think more people should join is that you get to be with all the cute animals. I know it sounds like hard work but it pays off . Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Thats all just part of the job though which is good.

One other benifit of the job was when your not checking on the animals you have some free time. The cowboys played baceball and volleyball gmaes in the empty hold where the animals had beed housed. Table tennis tounaments, fencing,boxing,reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time. See yes you have to work but you also get some time to have fun.

Thats why i think more people should be a Seagoing Cowboy but being that is much more than an adventure. For me it opened up the world im grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

It is an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Helping these people you can get the benefit of going to China and Europe and their famous landmarks. If you go to Italy there is a chance you could ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. When i was in Crete is saw an excavated castle. On your way to China you can marvel your eyes at the Panama Canal. If your not in the mood for sight seeing you can go downstairs with some of you co-workers and play some baseball,volleyball,fencing,boxing,reading,whittiling,and Table-tennis to help pass the time while on board.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me and was vey grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of peolple in other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me for along time. It lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. If you had any job or chore working on a farm then this job will be great for you.

When your on night watchman duty be careful when it rains. Because when I was on night watchman duty it was raining cats and dogs. I was climbing down a ladder when my foot slipped and I fell in my side. I nearly slid stright off the deck. But before i could fall i grabbed on to a piece of metal before i could fall off. I couldn't work for a few days because of a few cracked ribs. But if you do join just know that your co-workers are there to help you with injuries.

Luke said yes because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In 1945 world war ll was over in Europe and a lot of countries were left in ruins. so that sentence can tell you that if you participated you could help fix countries.

44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation.

In August 1945 they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived there on August 14th.

Luke was 18 when he arrived in Greece. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. when Luke was helping out on his aunt Katies's farm it had prepared him for hard work. Luke also found time to have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been housed.

When I turned 18 I could've been drafted to military but when they learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip they didn't make me. I was already helping other people out there. We helped people by recovering their food supplies, animals, and more. So you should benefit others and join us. It would help us and other people out there.

If you enter the Seagoing Cowboys you could sight all the countries in the world. You would also get to help others that have been hurt, and raise animals to give to others. This is a great way of helping other people with out anything. You would also get to explore other parts of the world.

First I went to New Orleans, the crew and I arrived there on August 14th. I got there the day the Pacific war ended. We got our seaman's papers and headed for Greece. We had 335 horses a long with us plus enough hay and oats to feed them! I will tell you what though you get attached to these sweet and loving animals.

I turned 18 before arriving in Greece. Instead getting drafted to the military service I got to keep going on with my cattle-boat trips! You should join because instead of fighting you could be on a ship full of lovable animals! By the time I was discharged I made nine trips! I think I broke a record of the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy!

I hope to see that you have joined this program, just like I have. Think about it you get to be with a bunch of adorable horses. You don't have to go to military services. Going to exotic places is a rare oppertunity...unless you join the Seagoing Cowboys Program! I can not wait to see your dission.

D25633DFFD2B,"Hello, my name is Luke, and I would like to introduce you to a program called Seagoing Cowboys. This program allows you to take care of animals, see amazing places, and go on exiting and lively adventures. You can also help your community. For example, when World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins, 44 nations joined together to help those counries recover. Seagoing Cowboys were hired to take care of the horses, young cows and mules that were shipped overseas. Who would not want to do all that and more? Nobody! There are so many reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys!

Have you ever seen a cow eat? If you haven't, they are hilarious! Also the animals can love you. Everyone loves to be loved. The animals could cuddle with you, and, in a way, protect you.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy also allows you to see unique and amazing places. When I went on my trips as a Seagoing Cowboy, I got to see beautiful places. I got to see Europe and China, but the most amazing place I went to was Greece. Plus, I didn't just sit on the boat, I got out and toured the contries. I also got to see historical places such as the Panama Canal.

Do you like exiting and thrilling adventures? I do! Going sailing as a Seagoing Cowboy allowed me to go on adventures all the time. There were dangerous times when the ocean was storming, the waves were huge, and sky black, but for the most part in was always nice. The ocen provided a cool breeze on a hot sunny day. The weather was perfect for sitting down and relaxing in the nice sunshine. So, as you can see going sailing with the Seagoing Cowboys is an adventure of a lifetime.

Here's the point, being a Seagoing Cowboy is awesome. You get to take care of the cute, funny, and loving animals. Plus, you get to see the most exotic places. Also, you have the privlidge of going on fun and thrilling adventures. There are many up's and down's to being a Seagoing Cowboy, but it was the best desition of my life, and I bet it will be the best desition of your life too.

If you like animals, this job is for you. One of the main reasons this program started was to help countries with animals, and that is a fauna-lover's dream. Another reason is that you can see the different sights in other coutries. The sights are absolutely amazing! You will be able to see the beautiful sunset on the sea and there is pretty much nothing prettier than that. But, if that hasn't changed your minds about not going, then this certainly will.

Some people say that seafaring is dangerous, or that you will not make it out alive if the ship sinks. First of all, there is absolutely no way that you will get killed on the ship, and second, there is about a fourteen million to one chance that the ship will sink, because our captain is the best in the world. Another reason you might not want to go is because you might get seasick. I don't think that is a very good reason to ot go, because one, you will get over it and two, the only reason anyone ever threw up on the ship is because he was watching The Exorcist an eating clam chowder. But that is a different story for a different time, so we'll be moving on.

The reasons you should go is that you can see new places that you have most likely never seen before or have never visited before. You will have an experience of how to take care horses,young cows,and mules that would be shipped from place to place.

But along the way you'll find out what it feels like to take care these animals like as if you were on a farm because these are animals that would be on a farm. Besides you could try new food that you could have never tried in your life. You could have a chance to meet new people. Also while in that place you could experience what their culture is and also what they do in that culture. The only places you would go to though would be italy,china,new orleans,and greece.

If you join the program then you will have so much fun with all the different places and adventures. One of the people who come here, named Luke has been to so many beautiful places. Luke has made nine trips, more than any member in the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke has toured an excavated castle in Crete and went to the Panama canal on his way to China.

If it wasn't for Luke's friend, Don Reist,he would have never been a member and he would have never seen any of these places that he has been to. Luke knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime. At the time Luke joined, World war 2 was over in Europe.

""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,"" he says. Luke has gotten hurt for other people, because he knew that what was going on in their lifes,are far worse than his.

0605820D0802,"I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it a really good program. You will see lots of different things that you probabaly have never seen before. Wouldn't that be cool? I was one and it was a lot of fun. You get to meet new people and see new things.

Some things that are a downside are when you are on the ship and a storm comes you have to make sure everything is latched shut and close everything. You also have to make sure that no one or nothing gets thrown overboard. It almost happened to me once, I was a watchman on my second trip. My job was to check on all of the animals every hour. Well, one night I was doing just that and I slid down a slippery ladder. I thought that I was going to go overboard, my heart was racing as I shot feet first toward a big opening in the side of the ship. I thought I was going to die, but I didn't obviously cause I'm still here talking to you. Well, a small metal strip stopped my slide, keeping me from going overboard. It was the best moment of my life when that metal strip saved me.

Now that that is over with I am goign to tell you some amazing places you might be able to go. These trips where amazing for a small town boy like me. I would have so much fun in the places that we would go. Most people thought that it was just work, work, work, but in all of reality it was some work and some play. Once I went to the Panamal Canal on my way to China. that was really fun. Another time I went to Greece. I turned 18 before arriving in Greece and that meant that I could be drafted fo rmilitary service. I wanted to, but when the draft board found out I was on a cattle-boat trip, thet told me to keep doing that for my service.

Sometimes we wouldn't have anything to do on the return trips so we would play games like baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals were housed. We would play fencing and boxing, sometimes even table-tennis and whittling.

Also we would read. These games where used to pass time because we had a lot of it.

In conclusion, I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. There might be some scary moments, but there are definetly some fun ones too. It is a really good program to just start a military career. You might even go on as many trips as me and if you do I will pray for you cause it is a lot of work.",5,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

If you are looking for work, this would be an amazing job that will change your life forever. You will need to put in hard work and dedication, but this job is worth it all.

Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be doing a good service. You will be helping countries and the people inhabiting them. For example, ""To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals..."" This is a valid reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. Not a lot of people get the chance to help an entire nation by bringing them cattle, mules, horses, and food. If you are worried that you will not get any free time, don't be. You get to sightsee whenever you land in port and experience very amazing places and things such as the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. An excerpt from the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" would be ""Besides helping people, you have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Another benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that it opens your eyes to needs in certain poor countries, or countries devastated by disaster. In addition to that, you have to put in a lot of hard work and dedication to feed and take care of the animals onboard the boat. But ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy is the opportunity of a lifetime.""

That is why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program.

You should participate in it also.

There were so many fantastic things about it, that I can't list all of them.

There were three main reasons that I loved the Seagoing Cowboys Program.

The first one is that it was absolutely fun!

The second reason is that I got to get the chance to really help others.

Lastly, I got to experience a lot of amazing things.

The first reason that I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that it was so much fun!

I got to tour so many new places that I had never even dreamed of getting to see.

I got to see Europe, and China, even the Acropolis in Greece!

That was my favorite part of the trip.

Another reason that I think you should join this program is that you get to help people.

I got to help so many others.

During World War 2, so many countries lost everything.

We helped these countries greatly.

We restored food, animals, and so much more to them.

I think that they are extremely grateful.

The last reason I think that the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great group to participate in, is that I experienced so many new things there.

War is never a pretty thing, and I got to see that.

You might not want to see this, but I've realized how important it is to help the people that have lost things.

After I saw the remains of this war, I realized how hard it was for the people.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is fun.

I got to help so many people, and experienced so many new things.

People might not have many reasons to support there statement about ""Why you shouldn't be a Seagoing Cowboy'', but I have at least some reasons as why you should join the program.

One of my many reasons is if you love working with animals then your up for the job. Many of the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" had to take care of the Horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On pharagraph two it states ""UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that weree shippes overseas.""

If you were to join the cowboys you will have to be able to go away from your family for a while. For example, on paragraph three it states ""In Augest 1945"", and on paragraph four it states ""By the time he was discharged in 1947"", what I'am trying to do is prove my point. Since you have to be away from your family, you won't be able to see your family in about three years. If you can go three years without seeing your familly then you have forund your job.

Besides helping people, you are able to see awsome sighting and go to places that you've never been before. You are able to go and see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Crete, Panama, and you could go to Italy. On paragragh five it states "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says ""So was taking a gondola ride in Vencie, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excaveted castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his was to China.

When the horses are around it's a pretty easy job. All you have to do is feed them, water them, and clean the stalls. Simple. You feed the horses hay and oats. Give them fresh water and clear their stalls every 1 or 2 weeks. It's a pretty easy job if you grew up on a farm.

Being on a boat, we have to make stops along the way. That is when you can go sight-seeing. On our last trip we were going to Greese, we stopped at Venice, Italy. I saw all kinds of cool stuff. I took a grandola ride down the streets of water.

It was really fun doing it and special at the same time because I got to help people in need and see Europe and China. I also played a lot off games and we got to just sit there and look at the Pacific Ocean.

First off the best part was that I got to help people in need. I mean these people had nothing everything they had got like wipped out. I got to go all over the place just helping people. All the places we got to see were all so pretty and delightful. By the time i go discharged i had alredy made nine trips that is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

There are many reasons to join the UNRRA. You get to help other people by giving them what they need to survive. You can by giving them food, clothing, and shelter. When you help other people with their needs, you get to go to other countries that you might have only heard about or not even heard of at all. When you bring people what the need to survive, you can see the joy on their faces. Seeing joy in others is a warm and inviting feeling. You can go sightseeing and go visiting very, very important places. I have been to many important places and landmarks, and so can you if you join. If you have dreamed about crossing oceans and helping others, then this is a job for you.

When the feeling of boredom strikes you if you have been on the boat for a long time, you have the chance to get to know your shipmates better and make friends. There also may be games to play on board like baseball and volleyball in empty stalls where the animals once were. There is table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling; which is carving things into blocks of wood and various other games. If you love taking care of animals, then you might be good at this job. There are many other jobs on board the ship. There is the opportunity to learn about your shipmates, learn what other countries and other people need, and there is also the opportunity to mature.

All of these things I have learned or done while on this job and trip around the world helping others. This is your chance to join the UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) or become a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" today. We need you now!

83AFAA560A83,"In the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" , Luke joined , or signed up , for the Seagoing Cowboys. This job was to do hard work overseas to help with cattle and feed.

On their way, Luke went and seen different places,like China! Convincing others to participate in this important job would be hard. I think it would be hard because it is hard work. You also have to go overseas , away from your family and friends.

It would be hard to convince people to participate, or help. This is because, it is hard work, and your always busy. Here is an example from the article,""His job was to check on all the animals every hour."" That proves that he is always busy. ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" That is an example that he is hard working.

They have to go overseas to Greece to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. Here is an example from the text, ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece."" People would miss their friends and family. They would also be sore from all the hard work they have to do.

Luke was greatful from start to end. In the beginning he was greatful to participate. In the middle, he done hard work , visited and saw great experiances. In the end, he was sore but really greatful for his part. ""I'm greatful for the opportunity."" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countriesand their needs."" That was an example in the text.

But best of all, he helped. These were some reasons and examples of why it would be sort of difficult to convince others , or people, to participate and take part in helping.       ",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
E98DC00E84A5,"First, I have to say that from Lukes point of veiw he is saying that being a Seagoing Cowboy is good because your giving supplies to countries so they can rebuild their country and you get to travel world, so it's a win win. Luke would want people to join because joining forces with countries to help other countries is something that is helping the less fortunate countries. Some peolpe just think their going over sea to help other people and that's boring,but, when your heading back home you can use the empty space that you put the supplies in for fun activities. I think people should join the UNRRA(the United National Relief and Rehabilitation Assosiation).

Next, Luke would want people to join because you never know what you might learn over sea. You may learn how to do things you never knew how to do like fishing or you might learn about the different countries you go to and you could share that knowledge with your friends when you get home. You could even visit muesems and see things you never knew existed. The things you see could inspire you to make something compared to that and it might be in a muesem one day.

Finally, Joining the UNRRA

is a great oppurtunity because you can do and learn thing you never knew how to do and learn you never knew about the country you might be inat that moment. You could visit muesems and see acieneit artifacts. You could see famous art pecies painted by really famous painters. If people would give the UNRRA a chance you could probably have a very nuce timeand think about inspiring kids to join when they grow up.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
84DE135F319F,"Hey,how are you today. Well I am here today to tell you why it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagoing program.

The reason i think it would be a great idea for you to participate in the Seagong program is because I just got done reading a artical called,'' A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,''.And in this story the author gave me many reasons on why it would be a great idea to participate in the program.

The first reason on why it would be great is if u enjoy caring fo animals then the Seagoing Cowboys program is the place for you. The reason i say this is because the UNRRA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Another reason on why it would be a great idea is the experience to visit many unique places,for example if u like to travel and visit places you can have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China or even better you can see the special sight of the Acropolis in Greece. Also you can take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,which is a city with streets of water. Another great thing about it is that you can tour a excavated castle in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal on your way to China. But if your lazy and non disaplined i dont think this is a good trip for you because you have to be prepared for hard work .

One other reason on why it would be a great idea is because if you like to have fun and enjoy yourself than this would be great for you because you can find time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time.      ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
346934F6BA88,"I always did love taking care of animals and doing other stuff as a crew of the Seagoing Cowboys.

I am here because many people argue whether be a Seagoing Cowboys is something you should do. I believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth the risk all just so you could help people and just have fun.

Helping people in need is really what matters in lfe. Its really in every human job there is. A dentist helps your teeth keep clean, a teacher helps you learn, and a mechanic helps you fix your car. Almost every human job out there is all about helping people. In my case I got to help people in need after World War II . I was in a group called UNRRA, which was a group who helped pople in animals and food supplies. I feel good now that I know I got to serve countries that were left in ruins. I am sure mighty proud that I became a Segoing Cowboy. It helped me realize that not only I need help but other people are also in need of help.

I also had lots and lots of fun while I was a Seagoing Cowboy. In case you ever got bored, there was no problem playing games. There were so many to choose from. There was baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. I was so entertained. When we played games the time flew by as if it were a cheetah on the clock. There was usually no way you could have got bored with all the choices you had as entertainment. This is another reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys.

I will warn there will be risks in doing this though. I know it sounds kind of dangerous, but I believe that it is worth it, and I would know. I once was night watchman, I had to check that every thing was going smoothly. Everything was going okay untill I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was heading for a entrance at the side of the boat, but a small strip of metal stopped my slide. I could have flown straight into the Atlantic Ocean. I also had broken ribs so I coulndn't work. Even though this happened I am still very grateful that I am alive and still helping people in need. I feel good putting my life at risk for millions of people in need.

I know that there is risk but it is worth it. You get to have fun and have a good feeling in your heart, all for just helping people in need. I am grateful for the oppurtunity, and it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. I do believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth it. Who knows maybe you'll become the next one.                             ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
946247C0F7EC,"How fun would it be to go on a sea adventure and get paid? Because if you were a Seagoing Cowboy that's exactly what you would get to do. All that you would have to do if you were a Seagoing Cowboy is take care of some horses and cattle until you got where you were needing to be. That sounds fun and easy to me don't you think? And if somethings fun and easy, and you get paid for it why not try it out? So I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One reason that you should join is because you could see some amazing sights as well as visit different countries, such as China, Italy, and Europe. Some sights that you may see would be the Elfell Tower, or roads made out of water, but only if you join.

Another reason is that after you dropped the animals off you could do some activities on the way back, like fencing, baseball, volleyball, whittling, and table tennis tournaments. That sounds like more than fun time by my standards.

I know some may say that they wouldn't do it because of sea sickness or others might say that it would be too dangerous because of bad wheather, but you can overcome sea sickness and the boats you're going to be on are made to withstand bad wheather. Plus I'm pretty sure that if the wheather's going to be bad we're not going to be sent out in it with the risk of losing cattle or horses.

Wow, all these things sure do want to make me hop aboard. I mean, easy money, sight seeing, fun activities it's basically a vacation you're being paid to go on! So find your sea legs lads and come aboard for a fun time.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

F296C5CF54D7,"There are many resons that people should do that. #1 is that it it would be some much fun to go explor places that you havent been befor, and go see all the unic culters that many people dont ever get to see in their life. #2 is that you could get closer with some of yor friends and family if they go with you, or invite you to go with them. Reson #3 is that you could meet new people learn other languiges too. Also you cold become part of a family they could take you in and youk cold have another really close friend from some were far far away from were you live.

In the story Luke said""It would a chance of a life time."" An I think it would be a chance of a life time. In my opinone I would do it. I would love to go on a trip tio eventure around the world. I love learning new cultres and to see what what it could help me with in my life. Also that it would be cool to do a report on all the places that you whent to in the proses. If I were him or any one els that got the opertunity I would say yes to doing it.

In my family its important to learn and get youst to doing thatbecause my famoly dose alot of edventering. We go to the D.R, Hawaii Colorado, and alot more places too. I think that any kid that gets invited should that, because what they learn stiks to them and it stays with them for a long time and if they dont then they missed a big opertoonity to do that.

I went to the DR for the first time when is like 5 years old and I learnd a lot of spanish when i as there. I also made a lot new friend people my age people that older younger than me too. An we bonded rely whell and i didnt know how to speek a word of spanish!!! I had a translator that helped me know what they were saying tio me and for them to tell the kids what i was saying too. i leand a lot of spanish when i wa there and i still know to say a lot of things in spanish too. I still kow my beat friens name in the D.R. We taught eachother how t say the alfabet in English and Spanish.

Just saying I had the best time of my life and I stayed in the same place the hole time and I still lernd a lot in one day.

And the hole time I was there I was so happy till it came to the part when I had to say by to all my new good friend that I made there. Its hard to leave but then you get to all the other places and meet other people there too.

People that want to explor should do this in order to see what ist like and if thay want to do this for the a long time or not. Just one time at a different place then were you live is awesome because you never want to leave. You could also go see uther animal sthat you have never seen befor in a zoo or that you have never herd of too. I love to see knew thing even if I have heard of it,or not, or seen it, or not it is still really cool to experiance that. An I think kids, aldolts, teens, or eve the elderl would stil love to see that or experiance that time with the family.

And that is my reso to do tha or a least tr yit out for the first time. It could only come once in a lfe time dont let it go to wast, because if you did than you made the biggest mustake of your life.           ",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Even though we have to take care of the animals and clean their stalls, it gives you a chance to feel good about what you are doing.

3E7B5824DB1B,"Have you ever wanted to travel for work and see new places? Well, as a Seagoing Cowboy you can do just that with a little extra included. I am going to tell you why you should join the program. I bet you should want to join the program after reading this.

Firstly on the starting bell, I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy because you can travel anywhere for work and have fun. Evidence from the text that supports my opinion is that Luke headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses. Also, Luke passed the time with table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. Both of thiese examples show that he had a lot of work to do but when he finishes early, he speeds op time with fun activities.

On the other hand, being a Seagoing Cowboy could be helpful at a young age because when you are 18 when you start and quit at 24, you could have some skills that could be usefull for an other job. Evidence from the text that supports my opinion is that Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece. As well, Luke had to feed the animals two to three times a day. Both of thiese examples show that if you become a Seagoing Cowboy and quit, you could be very good at your job if you become a zookeper afterwards.

My conclusion for this essay is that if you join the program, you could be informed by going to new places. Also, you could get new skills that could be usefull in the future like feeding animals and cleaning. If you do decide to join the program and become a Seagoing Cowboy, be aware of the risks but in all together it is a good idea to join.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

One of my reasons why you should join is because you are able to help others around the world. World War II ended in 1945, and peoples houses were destroyed from the war. This is a perfect time to help out and help build more houses. The people would be in joy and delightment for how you helped and you'll feel proud of what you accomplished. How about another reason why you should sign up?

Another reason to sign up is because you can travel around the world. If you like to explore, this would be the perfect time to join. You will travel to places like Europe,Greece,and China, which looks amazing by the way. These aren't the only reasons to sign up, but these are a couple of my favorite reasons why you should join. All of this brings me to my conclusion.

E895B5518815,"Luke Bomberger had his life changed for the better when he joined the Seagoing Cowboys. He had the pleasure of exploring the world and helping many nations in need. You could help the world too if you helped out the cowboys.

Luke shows that you have the chance to explore new places and meet new people when you are helping this cause. Luke got to travel all the way to China and he explored Venice, Italy. Luke also had the privelege of playing tournaments and various games on board of the cattle boat with his colleagues. You could make new friends and lend a helping hand with UNRAA.

One of the hardships of being a Seagoing Cowboy is having to take care of livestock. Luke provides information that it takes alot of hard work to maintain these animals. Some of the jobs that have to be done include cleaning pens, feeding the livestock, and getting them water. Even though this all seems like too much work, it still pays off with having the feeling of knowing you helped someone's life.

A final reason that you should join this program is that it shows hope that the world could be a better place for every nation. These people are helping provide food to citizens' lives who were affected by war. This shows a ray of sun shine to people who aren't lucky enough to have a home or food. It shows these people that they will be helped. If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, you could make someone out there feel like this.

EA4E657091C9,"You should join to help and say I helped that country. I think you should because there are things you have and other people don't. I also think that it should almost be a requirement to help people to go to heaven. I think alot of things should because I am like that.

I think a lot about others believe it or not. I love other people and apparently Luke did also. He understands the true meaning of love. He even knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime to help people in Africa,Asia,Haiti, and other places like that he had to understand that time is too valuable and other people give that time away to you to make you a better person and he is using it that way. Not saying this is all good there is downs too. Every rose has its thorns.

It is a lot of time that people spend with others. It was better for Luke I think because he was a good person. He had a heart of steel to make himself not say no to miss out on people in his family to go help other families. I think that was the best thing to do for anybody. He missed his mom,dad,aunt,brother/sister,nephew/neices,and his other friend to go help other people. Which makes me wonder if he's a Mason.

I know that he had to miss out because that was so much time taken up ,not wasted but taken up. He spent 2 weeks on each trip and then did it 16 more times! Reasons not ot would be. You could die in fog. I'm not sayin I wouldn't go but I wouldn'tlike to have the thought of dying in my brain. I bet more than once or twice he thought of dying and cried.

I know I would go but I wouldn't go 16 times because of the fact. There are sharks,squid,octopi,and plenty of other animals. The oceans are the most unexplored places on earth. People die millions of times a year because of the ocean and I have a high paranoia level so my paranoia would keep me on my toes. I would be so scared at times. There are 60 foot sharks named megalodons and can swallow me whole. There are plesiosaurs confirmed in the pacific. There is a six gilled shark that is 20 feet long. almost all sharks can taste a drop of blood 400 yards away. If they swim underneath a boat with 335 horses and 1 of 335 is bleeding or in labor. (the tissues and blood)I would die. I would probably have a heart attack.

I can't stand my paranoia. My friend was going to let a train go over him to prove he wasn't scared but I put a little paranoia in him because under a train gets hot enough to crystalize a rock and make it look like silver. What would it do to my friend. Back to the water.

Plesiasours started as lizards. Lizards have a third eye. It senses changes in lighting. Ripples and vibrations shift lighted areas. Horses make alot of noise and stomp alot. Stomping causes vibrations.

I was swimming in a river and I thought about rivers monsters when a log touched my legs I freaked out! I swam as fast as I could screaming ""jeremy wade jeremy wade""I was out of the water and on my grandpas house boat. I said hit the sand dam. From then and on I never went past clear water.

I don't think about stuff like look down its a log or stuff like that. I almost pee my pants when I see a spider. I think its because of me watching national geographic channel everyday and knowing what every animal does and how it hurts you.

I thought one time a jamaican cockroach could kill me .At the time I was three or four. My finger now was about as long as this cockroach. it stood up and it ran towards me. I was in my moms work and there were alot of animals there so I ran into the pig room. That was the day I figured out my mom would get me a mexican rat. From then on No roach came near me .But my fear is still here.

So then when he had it set up a lot of people came to support it and Luke convienced a lot of people, but also a lot of people not to help.

His program became national because how good it was and he said it was all the people who helped out he said, ""What I love about it was that they didn't have to do but how they did, it just makes me warm inside and very happy.""

If you don't have fun going to different countrys. Then, have fun on board.

Make up tournaments while you are going to a different place play different games like baseball, volleyball, and much more to do on board. Then, relax and read a book and sleep or take a nap and feed the animals and keep them clean so they don't be stinky and filfty. Keep yourself occupied and do something so you don't get bored and quit.

There are so many reasons to become a Cowboy. For starters, if you don't know how to do what a Cowboy does watch from other Cowboys or ask for help. Secondly, if you want to relax and to have a peaceful time just read a book in a quiet place and read so no one has to bother you. Lastly, the animals need your help to survive and live and so they could go to the other countrys they need to go to so that they could be fed and taken care of.

23156B9E3E53,"In this passage we see Luke's experience as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke shows us how being a Seagoing Cowboy gave him awareness for other people. He also shows us the many impotant things to learn from this job.

First, while being a Seagoing Cowboy Luke learned to take care of many of the animals.

He fed them and gave them water.

These actions, in turn, helped many people that were suffering.

Second, caring for the animals taught Luke to be responsible and to be a hard worker.

In the passage Luke said he had to make sure he fed the animals, give them water every day, and clean the stalls.

He also said ha had to be a night guard and check on the animals every hour to make sure everything was okay.

Next, other than taking care of the animals and doing different work, Luke also got to see new things and have fun.

He said he saw China, Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete,and the Panama Canal.

He also went on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Even on the boat Luke had fun.

He and the other cowboys played baseball and volleyball games, had tournaments, and did other enjoyable things.

Finally, Luke saw people that were hurting and that needed his help.

Luke said '' I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' and that '' It made me more aware of people...''

Because of the Seagoing Cowboys program, Luke helped many others, even after he was discharged from the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was a eye opening adventure for Luke.

It can also be a life changing experience for other people too.

They can learn lessons and help people just like Luke did.

It may also change their outlook on life. They may want to do more to help others in need, rather than just helping themselves.              ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

E9550BE84964,"Have you ever thought of being part of the great union of the Seagoing Cowboys? There are many reasons to be one, like the fact that you have intereaction with livestock, get to visit unique places, sail the oceans, and much more.

Seagoing Cowboys are people who sign up to the UNRRA. The UNRRA is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. It is 44 nations joined together to help the countries in need from being left in the ruins after World War II. Being a Seagoing Cowboy also counts as a military service.

While being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to take care of all of the livestock that is getting shipped across the ocean from one country to another. The animals have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. The animals need to be fed either hay or bags of oats, and every once in a while their stalls need to be cleaned.

One of the best things you get to do is sightseeing. You could get to have many trips and see many cool things. We do a lot of sailing on the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. In total I've been on the Atlantic 16 times and the Pacific twice. Don't even get me started on the unbelievable cattle-boat trips. For a small-town bot like i was it was incredible. I got to visit the Acropolis in Greece, sightsee in Europe, touran excavated castle in Crete, ride a gondola in Venice, and marvel at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't just about the travel and sightseeing. We still had fun on board, especially on the return trips when the animals had been uploaded and their stalls were empty. We would enjoy playing baseball, volleyball, table-tennis games. We would also play fencing and boxing matches. Last but not least we enjoyed reading, whittling, and other small games to pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was not only fun for me, but it also opened up the world in a whole different perspective. It also made me more aware of other countries problems and needs. With that experience my family was a host to a number of international students, and exchange visitors or many years.

I loved my experience as being a Seagoing Cowboy, and I hope you will too. Welcome aboard future Seagoing Cowboy!",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Would you like to be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program? If you don't, I am going to tell you about a text I read about a man. In this text, it says that a man named Luke Bomberger was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an oppurtunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA, a relief and rehabilitation administration. UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and his friend Don signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. In the text it also says that Luke went on cattle-boat trips. He also got to go to many places across the country. He also found time to have fun on board, ecspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That oppotunity of a lifetime is good to have because you could experience adventures you have never experienced before, and that is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The text also says But seeing Acropolis in greece was special he says. It also says Luke turned 18 before ariving in greece. It also says so was taking a gondola ride in venice italy. A city with streets of water those are a few of the things to do. And it also states To help these countries recover their food suplies animals and more 44 nation's joined together.

BC7E55C336AC,"Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is an opportunity of a life time. The places you get to go, experiance you gain, and the fun to be had is all to much to pass up. It opened up a whole new world to me and a lot of other people.

If it weren't for the Seagoing Cowboys Program, I wouldn't have visited half of the places I have in my whole entire life. While on the job, I had time to visit Greece, Italy, China, Crete, and many other countries. I even got to sail the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean 2 times!

Another reason that you should join is the amazing experiance you'll gain. When I first joined, I had a tiny bit of experiance with animals from helping out at my Aunt Katie's farm. But even if you don't have a little bit of a backround with helping out animals, you'll have all of the knowledge you'll need just by taking one trip. Being in the Seagoing Cowboys program also taught me about all of the dangers there are at sea.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is the fun you get to have. Yes, you do have to work hard and still get the job done correctly. But after the job has been completed, you can play games with the other cowboys. For instance, I used to play a lot of baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Other stuff that helped pass the time were table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

F7D1D884AAD4,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is fantastic because you get to do a lot of things. This is a once and a lifetime opportunity. Trust me you'll want to join just like my friend Luke didn't only like it he loved it.

First you get to see the world when you go travel on the boat ride home and back but, you don't have to go sit around and watch from the boat. When you get off the boat you have a reward. If you like to see stuff like Europe, Italy, China, Greece then you'll love it. If you don't believe me ask Luke he's the one whos been to all those places. He said that the boat trips were so unbelievable for a small town boy like him.

Also you will get to help people outside of your community. Like bring them food, water, and animals. It all ways feels good to help people in your own way. But it really effects peoples lives in the way you can help them. And it really doesn't take much to help those people.

But don't worry your not alone on this trip if you want company. You can make friends on the way like Luke did because after you give the animals to the people who need help there is room for things like Volleyball, Baseball, Table-tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling. These are all good things to pass the time after some hard work has been done.

So if you like to travel, help people, make friends and more then the Seagoing Cowboys program is for you and if noy maybe trying to recommend it to one of your friends who might like because I know Luke did.                             ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
08C12A8E0CD6,"As Luke says you can take many great expeditions, and it made him more aware of people and their needs. Luke had just turned 18 and that meant he could be drafted into war. But he was on a cattle boat so he could keep doing service there.

By the time of 1947 he was discharged, Luke had taken nine trips! That's a record for any Seagoing Cowboy. A big reason that you should join it (as Luke recalls), is because you get to help people in need. And get to lean more about there country. In the story Luke says that he got to see the Panama Canal. Wouldn't that be amazing?

Luke felt that it would be a chance of a lifetime to go and be a Seagoing Cowboy, and he just couldn't say ""no"" to Don. In 1945 WWII ended and many countries were left in ruins. So Don and Luke signed up to help. They helped for about two years before they were released.

He says that he also has much fun on board as well, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. They played games of tennis and volley ball where the animals once were. You'd have much fun on board and on trips.

Those are just a few examples of why you should want to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". As Luke says it is much more than an adventure.

When my draft board learned that i was on a cattle- boat trip , they h ad told me to just keep doing t hat for my service . 'by the time he was discharged in 1947 , Luke had mde trips - the mast of any saegoing cowboy. The cattle boat trip were an unbelivable oppportunity fo ra smalll towm boy,; he said , besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seein of seeeing Eurpe and China.

Then time past and Luke found time to hhave fun on board , especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded . The cowboys played baseball and they aslo had played volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournament, facing , boxing, reading , whittling , and games als help pass the time . But being a Seagoing Cowboys was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. it opened up the world to Luke e. '' i'm grateful for the opportunity'', he says . its made me more aware of people of other counties and their needs.'' And that aareness stays with him leading his familly to host a number of international students and exchange wisitersfor many years.  ",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

If you thought that you would be wrong the places in books are sometimes real and sometimes not and if you want to help people and go on a advencher this is the job for you. The perks of this job would be the trip and if a cow dies of old age it is a steak cook out and you can see more animals you thought possible in a bout. The sea is a inportant part of the job and if you are scard of water then this job is not for you.

Now the sites of a seagoing cowboy are absolutely amassing you could see greece and the Parthonon and rome with the romen coloseum and china with it's large 16th cenchery builidings and spain with it's large docks with large sea vesalls and englend and buckinghem palice and the tower of london and big ben and germeny the starting place of the war and home of hitller and berlin. If you like steak and other meat meals then you have to eat somthing different then your favoret meals becase of the cow on the ship the might get a little wored and start to get out of control but dount let a cow stop you from bring a seagoing cow boy and help with the things we need the do to help thoughts in need.

So if you relly want to get this job then you are exepted.

Another reason why I became a seagoing cowboy is it held some new adventure so if you are the advertures type you might want to be come a seagoing cowboy someday.

I'm just trying to say it is a great opertunatie to becaome advertures person or an exicting person and you never no maybe you go down in history some way some how.

I was able to exprince things that I could never see. When we were on our way to China, they stopped to let us excavated caslte in Crete. Also, on our way they let us stop to ride in a Venice in Italy. I could have never image that. The people on the ship did something very special for us. They let me see Acropolis in Greece. Not only did I see new things, I got to go to Italy, Greece, Crete, and Chine. Four countries in two weeks.

When we made it to China we were able to relax. I was able to play Volleybal, fencing, baseball, and boxing. Before we left we had a Table Tennis tournament. When I was done play, I sat down and had a silent moment of reading. This things help the time pass bye.

Through all of this I was able to help out familes. I help out the familes by taking care of the animals. So that they don't have to worry about it. It makes me feel good that I am helpping people out.

In conclusion, I would no trade this job for nothing. Even though I broke one of my ribs. It is all worth it in the long run. I have made new friends. It is an opportunity that I wouldn't take for grandted.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

I think this is a good idea because animals that arent taken care of well might get sick and mabey even die. Another reason why you should join the program is because they take care of horses, young cows , and mules that are being shiped to europe because world war two was happening and many countries need needed supplies. The seagoing cowboys also took care of 335 horses while there was another war was happening Luke said ""we arrived Agust 1945"", ""the day the pacific war ended"".

The seagoing cowboys is a good way to keep animals safe on boats, even if it is hard work and it takes weeks and months to reach your destination so be ready. If you plan on joining the program be sure to pack right and if things get tough rember it is for a good cause and that cause is to keep animals safe at sea, and it just might be an adventure of an life time.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
D43A9EBCC420,"Luke's participation in the Seagoing Cowboys effected his life and how he saw things. He got to see unique things, participate in the recovery of other countries during the war, and it impacted his life forever. Other people who want to help the world should definitely participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The first reason why other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is because they would get to help recover other countries from the war.

The text states, by the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. On all of those trips, Luke was helping deliver cattle to other countries to recover their food and animal supply. Many countries were in ruins and they needed the help that the Seagoing Cowboys provided.

Next, more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because they would get to see and visit many unique and interesting places around the world. The text states, Luke was able to see the Acropolis in Greece. The text also states, on his many trips, Luke got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Finally, others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it will change their lives. The text states, after his great adventures as a Seagoing Cowboy, Luke's family was lead to host a number of international students for many years. The text also states, this experience opened up the world to Luke. Luke also got to bond with new people on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He got to spend lots of time with them including times of playing volleyball, baseball, fencing, and many more activities to help pass time.

3CDA806BB14A,"I am Luke, I served as a Seagoing Cowboy. I think you should join this program because there are a lot of perks to it. My favorite part of being a Seagoing Cowboy would probably be helping people. I went out and looked for people in distress. I tried to help them as best as possible. I adored helping people even before I joined this group so I loved this part.

When I wasn't helping people I would treat my self to some site seeing. I loved seeing the Acropolis in Greece. That was my favorite! I also saw Europe, China, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, I saw an excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canal.

I also had a few scary times like one time I was just about to fall overboard on my night-watch, but this little piece of metal stopped me.

When I was on my way home and we had already loaded off all of the animals, I would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. I also read!

I kept going on these amazing trips and now I feel as if I have been everywhere! I'm sure that if you take this offer and join the Seagoing Cowboys then you will have plenty of stories to tell children and relatives.

A cattle-boat is a boat that carries animals across sea. When I was younger I helped my aunt Katie with her farm, that helped me prepare for the dangers that life holds.

Even though there are dangers at sea, I still like it. I am very happy while I am on this boat. It is an opportunity of a lifetime. ""I am grateful for the opportunity."" I said back in the 1900s. I was told by a captain to keep doing cattle-boating for my service. Your friends could help you become a cattle-boater. My friend helped me. By participating in cattle-boat, you could learn about other people and their needs. You could also learn about more cultures.

You may not think this a great ""job"" in all but actually, it kind of is. You do not know what is going to come at you. It's like a total suprise! You could be the driver of the boat, you could watch over the animals like me, you could do all sorts of things! We'll make sure you get fed. Who knows maybe you could even end up being the captain of the ship. That would be cool considering you just got here. You may think this is a joke but it's actually not.

There are a lot of men and women on this ship with the animals. You could be one of them, and who knows, maybe you'll try it and like it as much as me. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" When my friend asked me to go with him, I couldn't say no because I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Maybe you will have one of your friends come up to you an ask you to go to another country with them and away from your family. Maybe, you'll even say yes.

If you do go anywhere, tell me and I'll give you all the hints I know. Be careful though, the sea is dangerous. There have been a few ship-wrecks here and there. But not for a while. You are going to need a couple essentials: blankets, pillows, extra clothes, food, water, shoes and that is pretty much all you need for this boat ride. Have a good time!

AF6AAEDF7F48,"Life on a boat sounds terrifying doesn't it? Well you're wrong .You can do alot of things on a boat. Just ask Luke Bomberger. This man lived on a boat raising cattle.

Luke joined the seagoing cowboys after he graduated highschool. While Luke was on the ship his job was to clean up the spaces which had the animals in it. Sometimes his job was to check the animals every hour. Luke says that ""it was the opportunity to see or do different things. Besides helping people.""

when the ship arrived at different places Luke would explore the areas and go try different things. For example, he went on a gondola ride in Venice. Another example is he toured in a excavated castlein crete. My final example is that Luke marveled at the Panama canal. Luke also saw Acropolis and China.

Luke also found time to have laughs on the ship. The crew members and Luke after cleaning the hold would do sports. Such as, baseball and volleyball games. The would also do table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading , writing, and whittling. They also did boardgames.

After you did about 9 and below of trips. You see the world. It can also show you that other people in different countries need your help. Whether it's clean clothes,food,or shelter there is always a way you can help. These reasons show that living on a boat isn't so bad.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
547E1BE8EAE7,"Howdy there partner! I'm Luke. I'm one of the Seagoing Cowboys. The first thing is you'll be getting to see are the horses and taking care of them. It's really an adventure! Being a Seagoing Cowboys, i've done nine trips and each one of them was amazing. I went to China, Greece, Italy, Europe and many other wonderful places aroud the world. Each trip was amazing! Well here's a list of what are the advantages of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

1. The Seagoing Cowboys is a corperation that gets horses from all around the world. If you join today we could make our ship bigger to carry more horses and that would mean, new horses and new people on board!

2. When your on board you'll get to take care of the horses, play games after the horses are dropped off and see the scenic view! It's an opportunity of a lifetime! But be careful, you can slide off board! I once almost slid off board, but luckily I was careful and didn't fall into the icy, cold ocean!

3. You'll get to meet new people, you'll get to explore new lands and you'll get to help new people. Plus, if we go to Venice, you'll get to go on a gondola, like me!

Well I hope you become a Seagoing Cowboy, like me! And if you do sign up, just have fun, do your work and remember, you'll have to clean up after the horses! ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
9BD3373004E0,"Hi my name is Luke. When I was 17 my friend Don asked me to be a

""Seagoing Cowboy"". I said yes beacuse it was a ""once in a life time opportunity"". When I first became a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" the year was 1945.

When I turned 18 I had enlisted in the army. On the ship we had to work hard day and night, we had to care for the animals during the crossings, We had to lift the heavy bags of oats and hay. We also had to water the animals two or three times a day. It was hard but it was helpful to me. When I was discharged in 1947 I had made 9 trips that is more then anyone else. But I had some good times on the ship as a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". After we would drop all of the animals off where they were needed we would play game in their stals like, Base Ball, Volleyball,Table-Tennis,Boxing,fencing,and Whittling.

But in the end all of that hard work and time was worth it. I was able to go to so many places!

I went to

Greece to see the Acropolis. I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I took a ride in a gondola in Venice, Itally, with streets of water. I also toured in a excavated castle in Crete and marveld at the Panama Canal on my way to China. If you young peaple participate in being a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" I am sure that you will have the same experince as me, or mabey you will go on to bigger and better places then I ever could of dreamed of.

0EE17A80CE6D,"There are many different topics and reasons about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy but i'm not goning to mention them all if I did it would take me an excrutiateingly long time. So in cunclusion I am onley going to mention a few of them such as importance, adventure, and sites.

The importians of the Seagoing Cowboys was an extremley important person to be in that time period for saveing hundreds of thousands of cattle, hoarses and any kind of lifestock that was useful to the people. No matter how stormy it got they always tryed there best to keep on cource and never give up. They worked very hard cleaning stalls, feeding the animals, and giving them waterThey were always honored then and I think we should honor them now as well or better as they did back in the time of world war Two.

Oh and just imagian the adventure they had out on the open sea just having the time of there lives. They probably ran in to some nasty storms just think of the waves probabley huge waves the size of a mountain. In the story Luke almost whent flying off the shp but he got lucky he caught a peice of metal to hold onto. Cuold youjust imagian how much that would scare you, if you would have been swallowed by the hungery ocean. They could have even been flung overboard and eaten by sharks it just gives me the chilles thinking about it.

Oh just thnk of the sites they have seen they have probabley been all around the world. In the story it said that Luke he whent to Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. That was only one he even whent down the Panama Canal on his way to China! can you imagian dong somthing like that !? It would be spectaculer seeing those kind of sites. He even whent on a tour threw an excuvated castle now that is like the cherry on a sundae don't you agree?

That is why I think past Seabearing Cowboys shoul be honored for there services and not just ignored like they are today. My goal is to get the word out about the Seabearing Cowboys to show there importance to this country. So they arent just forgoten and cast away and not honored.

2E57A0350FFD,"Being a seagoing cowboy was much more than adventure, for me. I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.

I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.

So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.

I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.

So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.

I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?

After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said "", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor ""sleeping"".

He woke me up and said are you ok and I said yes and so I tried to get up but I couldn't and then I relized that my neck was broken.

So I was rushed to the hostpital and I had to get a neck brace and let me say that thing was a pain in the my neck. I was sent back to the ship and so I could work so I asked were are all the horses. My best friend said we sent them back. I said okay, I didn't really care about that. At this point I dint care about anything. A few weeks past and I was able to get back to work and I didn't have to wear the neck brace anymore. The captine said"", No more working nights anymore"". I said"", I agree I can't risk breaking another bone in my body"". So I didn't work on nights anymore whitch didn't bother me at all.",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

People should participate on joining because if there is more people then it's better because then it wouldn't take lots of time to do everything. People could get in groups and split to help people that are hurt or that are worried to get killed because of world war 2. If people participated then they could help out and help out on the ship because the horses had to be fed 2 or 3 times a day. Each person will have something to do if they particpated. if people joined then when they were all done then they could've got something because they helped out people that were in danger.

If you go on a trip like this one you are beeing audacious, brcause you can fal of the boat and fall in the surreal dark bolding water. When you get there you have to give the animals bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. When you see the animals faces your demeanor will change super fast. If you get invited would you still go.

If you went on this trip it would take you about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. When you are on the ship there will be ominous weather. You feel like a heavy rock after the storm is over. When you are on board you get to have some fun to you do not have to do chores all of the time. This is what you would say after a long hard day of work I-had-a-lots-of-work-with-animals-to- do day.

3F1F0EDF0BA4,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a once-in-a-lifetime trip that will change your life, just like it did mine. It was a spontaneous change of my life! I had a great time knowing that all the work I was doing was saving lives and helping others, and it made me look at things at a whole different perspective. I still learned more about livestock, even though I am a small-town farm-boy. I learned that life isn't perfect for everyone, and that I was taking my living conditions for granted. These things have made me a better person.

It moved me to see all of these people living in ruins. Tatthered clothing, rubble everywhere, mass graves, dead/injured livestock, and people were starving to death. The Seagoing Cowboys got over to Europe (and Asia) and reversed a lot of this. It came to my attention that we, Americans, are taking our lives for granted. This was a relatively easy realization to make, as things are in ruins.

I am more sensitive to problems people have and now know that I'm an animal-person. I now look at things through a more ""maybe it's worse"" perspective. This has made me a better friend, better man, and more well-liked. I have made no regrets since my return. I think that once you see someone living in these conditions, you reach out to everyone a little more.

If I could, I would do it again! If you try this, you will leave knowing you made a difference. The people who save lives doing this are heroic. They were brave enough to go to Europe/Asia and make a difference. I highly recommend you to take part in this program. Wars don't happen very often, after all!

You can also play table tennis, fencing, and boxing. After you played the sports you might be ready for a relaxing game such as board games or cards. If your not into those kinds of things then you can just read or whittle. There is always a fun option.

When there are tons of animals on the ship there is always work to be done. To help out you can feed the animals and/or clean their stalls.

If you joined the Seagoing Cowboys you could help a lot of people and yourself. I strongly think that you should join Luke in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for boys. In order to join the Seagoing Cowboys program you had to be a boy. You where in the Seagoing Cowboys program for as long as you wanted but, the highest was 9 trips. They take care of all types of animals and you get to go all over the world and see many different things.

First thing you do is to go over the seas. Next you find where you need to go so you can go and help the area that have animals. Second you have to help people and animals by taking them to a safe place and trying to help them with everything you have. Lastly you go back to find more or go to a new place to help new people.

Helping is a good thing for all people but, you can also look around the places you are. For example, you get to go to Greece and help cargo 335 horses and all so look at the place. Lastly you could get many items to bring back to remind you of going and helping the people that need it the most and by going somewhere fun.

If you join the program then you get to meet many different people and try many new things. But, going only for fun is not the main reason. The main reason of going is to help people, animals, and other things. It is World War 2 at the time and many animals and people are trying to help them selfs but, they can't and that is why you should help them and join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

These are all my reasons talking about why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you joined this program you could help many people and also help yourself in many ways.

I was prepared for this question and replied,"" Well, in this program you have to help take care of the animals, like horses and young cows, to cross the oceans.""

I felt like that sentence didn't have enough information, so I added,""World War II has ended and we need to assist other countries that have been affected by the war.""

""WIll it be boring?"" One man asked from the back of the crowd. All eyes were on me, their gazes intent on what I was about to say.

I stopped and mulled over my thoughts before answering,""Well, not really. You would be able to see other countries and their landscapes, but you would have to clean the stables and feed the animals. When they are returned to their destination, on the return trips you can have a lot of fun. I had played some sports like baseball and table-tennis with the other boys who had join during one trip back to America.""

The crowd looked interested. I felt like I had said the important parts to persuade them.

""Is it dangerous?"" One person said.

""It can be at time when it's raining extremely hard on deck."" I admitted.

I thought I needed to say more, so I added,""All the adventures you can have will be exciting, but one thing this program has helped me be aware of is the people of other countries and their needs. I played my part in assisting others, will you do the same?""

There was excited murmmuring as everyone surged forward. I felt pride in what I had said.

""I want to join!"" Someone shouted.

""Where do I sign up?"" Another one asked.

I allowed a smile to appear on my face as I pointed to the left. ""You can sign up over there.""      ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
B53FF24A0324,"Have you ever wanted to go around the world. Or maybe do something that not everyone gets a opportunity in there life to do. Become a Seagoing cowboy and help others in need. Seagoing cow boys are pepole that go on ships with animals such as horses,mules,and young cows that were shiped over seas because of war.

One of the reasons that you should become a seagoing cowboy is becasue when do you ever get a chance to go all around the world for free? As you aborad the ship there are some resposibiltes such as feding and watering animals,and pulling up bales of hay and bags of oats from the holds. Because of war the animals have to be shipped to many places like China,Italy,and Greece. Sence your on the boat with the animals you also get to vist these wonderful places. Its like a opportunity in a life time.

On the way back you may think there well just be a whole bunch of vacant spaces full of hay. You also may think a vacant area is usless,and boring without animlas living in it. But this is not the case. On the return we fill in the vacant spaces with fun activites such as volleyball ,baseball ,boxing ,tabeltennis, reading,and Whitting. So this makes the way back as much as fun as it is on the way there.

Take seagoing cowboy Luke Bomberger for example. As he gradutaed high school his whole life changed when his fellow friend Don Reiest asked him to join the UNRRA.The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation. Of cource Luke said yes becasue it was a opportunity of a life time. How could he have said no? He got to vist famous places like the Acroplis in Greece. And on his way to Chona he got to vist the Panama Canal.

These are the reasons of becoming a seagoing cowboy. If you are asked you should go you would like it. Traveling the world and you would not only be helping pepole,but helping animals. Take the opportunity be a seagoing cowboy.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
9407DB8BEDB6,"The Seagoing Cowboys is a unique job, and also a once in a lifetime oppurtunity. I think you should try it. Luke Bomberger said It opened up the world to him, ""I'm gratful for the oportunity, it made me more aware of the people of other countries and thier needs."" And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""

'It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover thier food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).' As stated in paragraph 2.

'UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.' As stated in paragraph 2. Luke had made nine trips in two years of ""service."" Luke says in paragraph 5 that ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke also toured am excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China

You have to be prepared for long, rocking, swaying trips. If just reading those words made you sick then I suggest you don't go. 'It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.' Luke had slipped down a ladder and broke a couple ribs, so, he could not do very much heavy work.

'Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and gmaes also helped pass the time.'

In conclusion I think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be fun! It sounds like if I were one I would be pretty amazed and entertained. It opens up the world to you. Luke says in paragraph 9 ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thir needs."" So give it a try. See if you like it.

There are a lot of benfits that come with it as well.

I was a Seagoing Cowboy for two years, and made 9 different trips.

One of my first trips was to Greece.

We delivered 335 horses and brought along enough hay and oats to feed them.

We also got to go to places like Coastal Europe, China, Italy, and the Panama Canal.

Being a small town boy I didn't get to experience many things.

I worked on a farm most of the time.

Now being a cowboy I get to do the same thing with more opportunity involved.

Getting to help people in so many different places is amazing.

When we aren't doing our job we can go visit the community and experience there cultural antiquities.

We don't always work.

When we're done unloading the cattle we sometimes use the animal holds to play games.

We play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and boared games. We also read, and whittle to help pass time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was an incredible experience, and I would love to do it again.

I got to meet a lot of amazing people and experience different cultures.

Even if you don't want to deal with animals you can help by recovering people's food supplies and if you don't want to do that there is even more that you can help with.

Also it could be a once in a lifetime experience. If you can't afford long distance travel this would be perfect because you get to travel and help people. Just think about it, a long time from now you might be thinking, ""Man I wish I would have helped with that."", or something similare.

By now you may be convinced that you would love this, but if you're not, think of how FUN it would be. After you help with your mission you can go visit places like a castle, the Acropolis in Greece, and even go to Venice, Italy according to the article: A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.

That's why Luke claims during his adventures he got to go many different places as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke also claims that before arriving in Greece he had his eighteenth birthday, which ment he could be drafted by the military. When the draft board learned that Luke was on a cattle-boat trip they made a deal with Luke stating that he could work on a cattle-boat for instead of military service. After two years of cattle-boating Luke was discharged he had the most trips of any Seagoing Cowboy he had nine. Thats why Luke claims instead of fighting in the military a person could be a Seagoing Cowboy and bringing animals like horses and cows to people in need acrcoss the sea in Europe, China, or other countires that need help and food after battle or a major war that they lost.

But what I didn't know that my life would change soon after I graduated. So thanks to my friend Don Reist he invited me ot go to Europe with him on a cattle boat. So of course I couldn't just say no because if I would have to be just carzy It was a life time opportunity.

It was in the year of 1945, it was the time of World War II. So to help people recover, 44 nations joined to form a UNRRA. The UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So the next thing you know Don and I were signed up.

In August 1945, we received our orders to go and report to the New Orleans. "" We arrived August 14 ,"" Luke said. Which was the day the that the Pacific War ended. They got their Seaman's paper and boarded up the SS Charles W. Woodster, headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses and plus enough hay to feed them all.

Luke's birthday happened before arriving to Greece. He turned 18 which meant he could be drafted to military service. "" When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle boat trip, they told me to justto keep doing that for my service.""

You can have many things if you become a Seagoing Cowboy!

Instead of my service I became a Seagoing Cowboy and got animals across the sea safely. I washed them and cleaned them over and over but in all those chores I got to travel!

I got to see Europe, China, Greece, and Italy! I was a small town farm boy and then I got to see all of these places, all because I became a Seagoing Cowboy! You can become one too!

I'll admit that there are some dangers in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I almost fell overboard and broke my ribs! I wasn't able to do anything for the animals for a couple of days but they kept me company. Even though becoming a Seagoing Cowboy has its faults it overall is very exilerating and makes life an adventure! You can become a Seagoing Cowboy just like me!

The text states, ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of: The horses, young cows and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.""

That was just the first reason and if you don't understand it i was trying to say you could help ship and save many animals lives. Now the next reason that might change your mind and help you began to slowly realise that you should join is going to different places. In the artical is states that Luke actually went to greece when he turned the age of 18. Which he even had free time on his hand and had fun doing his job

There is also fun on the ship when the animals get off and you have a little bit of time to play around. The author states, ""Luke also found time to have fun on board (When the animals got off the ship of course) the cowboys played baseball and volleyball and such.""

Now this job is not as easy as it seems and it can be dangerous, as you can clearly see that the text states, ""Luke was on night watch and slide on something, luckily he did not fall in to the atlantic but he still could not work do to the broken ribs."" As you can see its not that easy and can be dangerous if you're not careful and check your surroundings.

But by the end its all worth is, im sure luke felt good about himself once the job was finished and done. Touring around different citys, helping feed animals.

In this passage there is a lot of good things and bad things about being Seagoing Cowboy, like what fears you have to overcome,what jobs you do, and how long you have to do it and what kind of fun they have.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

To become a Seagoing Cowboy you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When he was going to make his hourly report to his captin he fell on a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowboy. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also he had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took his ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowboys got to have some fun. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

Tabel-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

To sum up my thoughts, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't that bad.

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowboys in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowboys.      ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

We need help to save these countries, so come on down and sign up to become one.

First,some reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program are, getting discoverd. For example,if your 18 like I was you could be drafted for military service which means you would be able to help the world and have a great job. Another reason, you should join is because,you can discover some amazing things. For example, you could see places like europe,china,italy and greece. Also you will be helping a lot of people and animals because,you will be doing things for the benefit of there need. All of these examples show reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.

Next,but for me being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure.''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Just like it made me look at the world diffrent it might be the same to you or even an acheivment you have accomplished. Their are some reasons you might be scared to go. For example you might be scared of failing or being flown over board. But as long as you stay together with the person your with and do what your supposed to you wont fail.

Another good reason of going to the seagoing cowboys program is helping people. World war 2 was over in europe and many countries were left in ruins and if you want to help all the people in ruins you could join the seagoing cowboys program. UNRRA hired the ''seagoing cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. So from what the UNRRA said that means you probly would be getting paid. Even if you dont get paid its still a good thing to do to help people that need help. All of these reasons state why this is a good reason to join the program.

In conclusion,all these reasons I have stated will really help people. Helping is what the seagoing cowboys program is about and it will make you more aware of things like other countries in need. If your not 18 yet and you want to be drafted for military service join more than once because, the more you join the more your helping the people,animals,and enviorment.

There is a 99 percent chance that you or your family memeber will die or get hurt.

Luke also wanted to go seasgoing to show his friend how manly he is. Because his friend thought that hhe was scared to do something that is not normal in his life.

So Luke wen't over sea to show his friend he is not afraid. But when Luke is over seas something bad happens. Luke is feeding the animals, and he trips over something and just about fell over board to his death.

Luckly a peace of medal was sticking out the side of the ship and caught Luke before he almost died. Aways be carful when you on a ship traviling. Something bad aways happens. But anways Luke had a friend come along so they could hang out like most friends do.

Luke and his friend was on the ship, and they stopped at a place where the horses and the animals had to get off. Then the boys had to find something to do so where the horses and the animals stayed is where the two kids started to play games like Baseball, Volleyball, Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling.

So when the two boys were done doing their stuff like playing games they wen't back to their homes, to see their families. But when their time was up off seeing their families they both wen't back to the ship, and said bye to their families for a long time then it was time to go.

The two boys did the same things they had done the last time they were on the sea. Then finally the day the two adults have been waiting for has now arrived to them. Now it is time to go back to their homes for good, and stay with their siblings and parents, and friends.

One thing that all the people noticed when the two got back fromw sea. Is that the two boys they use to be are now gentlemen, not lids anymore. Then the never let those two lovible boys go on sea again. They couldn'y loose the boys again. Not now, not ever, never again.

But of course they left again they could not stay with their families for ever. They just had to go back on seas again they had to. It was like their life when they wen't on the ship.

The audults were now old enough to go to the military. Lukes friend wen't on. Lukes friend entered the military as soon as possible. He really wanted to support his countries.

When the two kids got back to each other and started hanging out again. THey both wen't back to the sea job again cause they really liked it. They wen't there together nine times so they could see each other alot, and they hung out alot of course.

When they got bak the two boys wen't straight to dee their mothers to see them right away. But when they got there they did not see there mamas at the house. Then the siblings and the other family memebers came out and told the two boys that their momas were gone.

83B5F5AC7EE3,"Just because the Seagoing Cowboys program seems old, it is still a good thing to join. The Seagoing Cowboys fit many people's needs. Our number one reason for this program is to do good deeds for other people in other countries. We help these people after wars, and when their towns are destroyed. Although I only helped take care of the animals that were boarded on the ship being sent over, I still benefitted to the people on the ship by doing work for them. It kept me busy. I watched the animals and and checked on them, and I also reported on how they were doing. I also had night shifts to check on the animals each hour. One night, however, I slipped on a ladder, and couldn't work for a few days because of racked ribs. Thankfully, I fell on a piece of metal, and it caught me from falling into the ocean. I am lucky to be alive!

We don't work the whole time in the program, however. You would like what we get to do when we aren't working. We exlore and visit new, interesting places. We go to several different countries, and get to see how the people's culture, life style, and needs are different than ours. I had gotten a tour of a castle in Crete, visited China, Europe, and the Acropolis in Greece! Not only did we visit places, but we also had some freetime once in a while on board. We had baseball games, volleyball games, tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program, it is beneficial to 18 year old men, or men older than 18. Why? It is because when you are drafted to the military services at age 18, the military will count this program as your serving. I had turned 18 while I was on board and before we had even arrived to Greece, and I knew I couldn't be in the program and military at once. Lucky for me, the military coutned it as my service.

You can make plenty of trips, but they might be long. It is fun sailing across oceans seeing the fish and the water as long as you do not mind getting sea sick or homesick.

Boy let me you it is a hard job. But the worse part of taking care of my cats is when they get sick all over the floor.

So I dont really see why taking care of 100 some horses would be fun. unless you like horses. Then you would be working on the boat durring a war. that would be dangeras. Plus you would never be home to see your familay unless they came with you. But that probly wouldnt be allowed.

What if you get sea sick? Or a horse gets sick and spreds it around to the other horses? What if the boat springs a leak? A lot of lives will be at risk. Plus what if an animal that you are alergic to comes on the ship? What if the engine breaks and you cant move? Or you run out of food? What would you do? or if the lights quit working while your in the fog or its nigh, and your right in the middle of an ice berg feild? that would be a very rogh time.

14CBFC592998,"Why should you participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? This program sent people across the sea with animals, food, and other resources that other countries needed after World War Two. I have personally participated in this program. After crossing the Pacific Ocean multiple times and the Atlantic Ocean more than 15 times, I would say this experience changed my life completely for the better. Others should join this charity type program, it will improve you and your life.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience to have participated in. You get to see many natural and man-made landmarks you otherwise would not see. You get to visit many other cities and countries you would never be able to go to if you weren't hired as a ""cowboy on a boat"". Luckily, you can easily become a seagoing cowboy to make your life so much more exciting. Also, since you've always wanted to sail the seas, this would be a great opportunity. You'll always be excited as you float upon an uknown section of the earth. It almost sounds like a fairy-tale, but you can fortunatley actually live it. During what will be the greatest time of your life, you won't be lonely either.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, it's a chance to be social and put yourself in a friendly environment. You can play games and sports with the other participants. Find someone with the same hobby and have a conversation with them, so you will have a pal to do your favorite hobby with. Just have a talk about the things you saw, what you did, what you were thinking before you decided that it was obviously a good idea to become a Seagoing Cowboy for the UNRRA. Play table-tennis with them, maybe baseball, or volleyball. Do some reading by yourself or wih your pal to keep your brain just as good as it's always been. Maybe you want to box someone, or help someone out.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, you would be helping a lot of people and even countries get back on track after the devestating World War, which is unfortunatley the second world war. It could be a way to contribute to a charity. By directly delivering food, animals, and help to those who are helpless. Now, when you think about how that's what you're doing by going out to the sea, it makes you feel good, doesn't it? Not only does it make you feel great about your own life, but it actually makes another countries inhabitants feel good about their life, that they have their life despite the ruins of their country and their world after the war. So, it's obviously better for everyone when you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Since you'll be helping other countries, having fun with friends, and experiencing a lot soon, you may be second-guessing yourself and thinking, ""What if I don't want to go to water, and I don't want to sail the seas?"" Well, assuming you don't like the water, you don't go on a boat often. Since one main thing of being a Seagoing cowboy is the experince, you'll be trying something you haven't done or don't usually do. You may still not like the fact you are on a boat in the sea, but after that, there are more benefits than there are things you don't like, which would be only one con.

Luke Bomberger helped recover food supplies,animals and much more. 44 other nations joined a group called UNRRA. The Seagoing Cowboys were taking care of animals. Luke had made nine trips in1947, it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! Luke thought it was unbelievable for a small-town boy!

He felt special helping people and animals, an seeing countries. How would you feel? It must have been busy for Luke caring for animals! Taking care of animals is hard work ,imagine taking care of 15 or more!

Would you enjoy taking care of many animals? When Lukewatchman duty and it had been rainy so it was slippery Luke had slipped and fell he had cracked his ribs and couldnt work for a few days. When they unboarded they played many games and sports. Luke was more aware of other countries and needs.

I think it would be fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy and help countries. would you want to? Helping Countries is very special and i would do it.     ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Program

Luke thinks that you should should prticipate in Seagoing Cowboys program. I mean,why wouldn't he,he had a great time there and he thinks that you would to. Just in case you don't believe me I will provide some details from the story to prove it.

For instance,in the story he even says that he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. Now tell me that doesn't sound like he knew it was going to be great experence for him and it could be a great experence for you.

Another example is in the last paragraph when he said that he was gretful for the opportunity to be a Seagoiong Cowboy. Now i'm just stating the facts to to you that he is trying to convience people to be a Seagoing Cowboy and if your not agreeing with me yet then I guess there's no way of convincing you.

I have another piece of evidence since you still don't believe me. He also says that Luke also had fun on board. This piece of evidence just proves that he had a good time just being on the boat.

In conclusion, I truly think that in this passage he was trying to convince others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program and Ithink that you should believe that to. I gave you my evidence and my reasoning why I think this and if you read my evidence you should to.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
D123B48DE9CD,Luke made a good choice to go to China so he could help do stuff and help other people and help with World War 2. He could also help the horses and protect the horses and train them. He could also do stuff people couldn't do or help the people that need help or he could also protect the people that are hurt and take them to the nurse or the hospital. He has a good reason to go to China and protect people he could help his friend do stuff or he could do it for him and he could also fight with people and he could fight the other Country and he could also give people the horses of they need them. His friend had a good reason to take Luke with him to China so he can do a lot of stuff with him. It is a opportunity of a life time for Luke. Luke was excited to go to China to help other people and train horses and fight vs other Countrys and help people that are hurt also ride horses with his frinds and have a lot of fun with his friend. It took him two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean and it took him a month to get to China and when he got there he was so excited to be there so he can fight and ride horses and train them. He had no idea his life was going to change. it was when he graduated high school then his friend asked him if he wanted to go to China. When he was asked he couldn't of said no so he couldn't feel bad. He went to the Atlantic Ocean sixthteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice.,2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
AABDD28FE482,"I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. The progam lets you see sights that you would never see in your life. The program also lets you help people that need food. While you are out on the water you get to relax for a while and get away from loud city noises.

The first reason you should consider signing up is that you get to see beautiful sights in different countries. Going and seeing different countries is something you would never do in your life but, if you sign up you will be able to go and see things that you would only see in pictures. Going to these countries is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

The second reason to sign up is that you get to help people. While your gone you get to help people have a better life. You get to get them cows , chickens ,etc, to help them farm and get better meals. Getting people food saves their life and betters it. It is not as easy as going out to the store and buying food that you need. They have to farm and grow crops to eat. Giving people food that they need gives you a warm fuzzy feeling.

The third reason that you should sign up is that while your on water you get to relax and get away from loud city noises. Getting away from the city for awile is good, you get to figure out how to live away from the city. Also you get to relax and just hear the sound of water hitting the sand.

You could probably get a better night sleep after you hear the water.

I think you should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to see amazing sights , you get to help people, you also get to relax on the water. These are three reasons I think you should sign up. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
A5E6937363A9,"The Seagoing Coyboys were having some of the best times of their life! Luke is a Seagoing Cowboy. Doing this job is so much fun! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is exciting because of the unique places, helping other people in need, and it keeps you very busy during the trip.

The first reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because of the unique places you go. The possible places are Greece, Crete, Panama, and Italy. You could see the acropolis in Greece. Taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy would be magnificent too! You could see the famous Panama Canal or an excavated castle in Crete. Thre are so many different opportunities! You could sign up for this program right now!

A second reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because you could help other people in need. Luke didn't even know of all the people of other countries. That awareness stayed with him for a long time. His family has hosted a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. Luke helped the countries in ruins that were left after World War II. He helped take care of the animals such as horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

A third reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because it keeps you extremely busy. You will be as busy as a bee! As I said, you take care of the animals they take overseas. The animals have to be fed, given water, and have their stalls cleaned. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship. Luke was also a night watchman once. He had to check on the animals every hour. He had to make an hourly report as well. You don't work the entire time either. You have time to play games and do sports as well.

Some people may say you should not be a Seagoing Cowboy. They may say it takes too much time or it does not do you good. I would counter this statement because this job teaches people responsibilty of taking care of animals. Being overseas does take a while, but it does teach people patience. There is also time to sightsee and play games. These reasons show being a Seagoing Cowboy is not a waste of time.

After reading this article, I learned a bunch about Seagoing Cowboys. I still don't think this job is a waste of time. This job will teach you many things. Afterwards, people will be as happy as a puppy wagging its tail! All of these reasons lead me to believe that more people should join this program.

Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

UNRAA hires Seagoing Cowboys to sail livestock to assist the population of the world in recovery. These are people who are more aware of people of other countires and their needs. The awareness stays with them. Here's why you should join.

First off, the adventure! You will sail across the world and visit many wonderful countries and their people in your quest to provide relief from a terrible disaster. It sounds like something right out of a storybook, doesn't it? Another reason is the sightseeing. You are provided with lots of freetime, so why not enjoy the beauty of both Mother Nature and mankind whilst you're on your journey. Maybe you'll get lucky and get to see the Panama Canal, or the temples of China. Also, wouldn't it be great to see the happy people and, most importantly, the children who you're going to help get back on their feet. Remember that warm, fuzzy feeling inside when you get doing something good? And if you like animals, and/or the ocean, you're going to want to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Some people may think that this would not be fun for them and that you might miss your family while you gone, but there is a solution for that. You could bring your family with you and bring things with you to help pass the time.

128414C6478A,"The reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because its an opportuntiy of a life time,as said by Luke. There isn't just one reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program there are thousands of reasons. The main things are the locations,the people, and the experiences.

To start my reasoning, you could help thousands of people. You could also have fun on your adventures sailing to all these different contries and states. As you grow you will learn more about what you are doing. You could get really cool things when your traveling too. You could even help take care of animals.

Secondly, you could do really cool things on board. You could get to watch animals, play baseball,volleyball,table-tennis touraments, fencing,boxing,reading,whitting,and games that could pass the time. All of those things Luke did on board. You can do all of those things in empty holds.

In addition, for Luke it was much more than an adventure. You have someone to look off of and to see a ture experienceof being a Seagoing Cowboy. Now you should see why Luke said it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

In concusion,I see why its so great to be a Seagoing Cowboys. The places you travel to,the people who you travel with, and the adventures. Just think of all the fun you could have on that very special boat just wondering what lies on the other side of that island and what you could learn the points are endles. So join the Seagoing Cowboys and then you could get in for sure. How you will react when you take that first step onto the next part of your life

Some of the parts to make this possible are ,''Luke could't say no. He knew it was an opportiunity of a lifetime. Paragraph 7 tells you that he lives with his aunt Katie and paragraph 8 is where i got how many things he did while he was on board and why they thought theose activities were fun. The end about how it was more than just an adventure , I got that from paragaph 9. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
4857EE33213F,"The article "" A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" is about a boy named Luke Bomberger. His friend Don Reist invited him to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew it was an opportunity of a life time. To help these countries recover their food suplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.)

In 1945 the UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On

August 14 1945 Luke and Dom headed for greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus. In 1947, Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The Cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

I think that being a "" Seagoing Cowboy"" will be fun and adventurest. As you travel on the cattle boat you will be able to visit unique and amazing places. You will also have fun while you are doing it. You will also be able to experence lots of thing that most others can not. As your doing these fun and exsiting stuff you will also be helping those recovering countries in need of help with food suplies, animals, and more.

So in my point of view and Luke's is to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If i were you i would definatly help thhose in need of foos suplies and animals. If you like/love animals and helping others in need this will be a perfect job for you.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
2D2288A28050,"I think one reason to join is because he helped people who needed the help beacause in the strory World War 2 just ended and some people needed help getting their country's or city's back together. Another reason is because he got to go on an adventure by traveling on a boat with cattle, horses, and more. Also he had an adventure by traveling at sea and seeing all the wonderful things at sea, also he visited many unique places while he was on the trip as he did in the story.

Luke claims these reasons by telling the reader how he felt being on the trip and telling them how he helped all of these peaople. Also he told us why he kept on going out and doing/helping anyone he could. Another way he claimed his reason's is by telling us how and what he did on his free time from wherehe was at. Also his emotion tells us how he claimed some parts of his reason's.

I belive that this show how Luke claim's his reason's because one he used his emotion by saying how he felt when he was there. Second He said that he had a fun and adventurious time at sea caring for the horses and other farm animals. Also last bot not least he told us what he did on his free time witch was go explore and get tours of special building's that were/are special to the people who live there.

FACF20D0D847,"All right, to some of you people this might not sound too interesting but just hear me out. If you want a really excellent job, be a cowboy in the Seagoing Cowboy program. In fact, take it from me a cowboy who rides waves.

I became a Seagoing Cowboy when me frend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was when World War II was going on. Some countries were left to die and had nothing. So they formed the UNRRA and hired ''Seagoing Cowboys.'' Both I and Don Signed up.

In August of 1945, they recived orders to go and report to New Orleans.''We arived August 14,'' Luke recalled ''the day the Pasific War ended.'' They got their seaman's papers and and borded the SS Charles. W. Wooster. They then headed for Greace.

Before I got to Greace he turned 18 wich ment the military could draft me .''When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip,they tolde me to just keep doing that for my service,'' Luke says.

''The cattle boat trips were an unbeliavable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.'' but seeing the Acropolis in Greace was very speacial. So was takeing a gondola ride in Vince, Italy a city with streets of water.''

It was also hard work. I had to clean, feed, and care for the anamals. I seved as a night wathman, meaning I had to cheak on all the anamals and report to the captin every hour. One ranny night after my hourly report I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was fine but couldn't work for a couple of days because of broken ribs. I also had fun too and played vollyball games in empty holdes and more.

So in conclusion, It's splendid to be a Seagoing Cowboy because it shows you the vertue of helpping others.       ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
FBDCEEB8E7BD,"Hi, I am PROPER_NAME and I really recomend that you join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program can be hard work at some time,so be ready for that. There are also many benifits to this trip. I myself had a very exciting and memerable journey, and if you decide to join you will have one too.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see tons of new places. I got to see places like Europe and China. I also met and created a bond with new people, While I was there I saw new cultures. This program allowed me to be aware of other countries and there needs by not hearing about them, but actually witnessing it. I also had some fun on board with the other members of the Seagoing Cowboys club. We played games like fencing, boxing, and even table tennis.

Now if I told you that the Seagoing Cowboys program was all fun and games, I would be lying. There is a lot of work to do. One time I fell down a slippery ladder. I didn't die,(because if I did I couldn't have wrote this.)but I did get hurt badly and I cracked my ribs. There are many responsibilities while on board. I had to work with animals. I had to load and unload them off the ship. Also on my second trip I was the night watchman, and my job was to check on the animals every hour.

Even though there is is work to be done the Seagoing Cowboys program was a great opritunity for me, and it could also be a great opritunity for you.Helping out at my aunt PROPER_NAME's farm prepared me, and maybe you have some preperation too.This trip taught me more than i could have ever learned at home.The Seagoing Cowboys program really opened my eyes.I hope I go again,and I hope I see you there.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
AF1B50339EB7,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a wonderful expirience. The trips you took were an unbelievable opportunity. By 1947 I had made nine trips which was the most trips any Seagoing Cowboy has made. These are the expiriences I had being a Seagoing Cowboy that will convince you to join the program.

It all started in 1945 when World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. Helping people is a wonderful thing to do and that is something I got to do while being a Seagoing Cowboy. I also got to help lots of animals that were shipped overseas in the World War ll by feeding them and caring for them. Some of the animals I got to care for were horses, young cows, and mules. Also by being a Seagoing Cowboy I got to visit lots of different countries and meet new people. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy was very special to me. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. It is also very fun on board with the other cowboys. We played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. These games weren't only fun but they also helped pass some of the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy has opened the world to me. It has made me more aware of the people from different countries and their needs. If more people join this amazing program they will most likely expirience the different countries that I had been to and meet the different people that I have met.

Reason why i would join it is because when they get to travel around and they can see things like animals and so that i can play with the animals. If u were a small time boy just like Luke Bomberger you could have a unbelievable trip. The trips were amazing also but the one that standed out to me was the cattle-boat trips. It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well he. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour he was going to cheack on theam when he flew and he broke his ribs. But most importantly of all it opened up the world to Luke Bomberger he said he is grateful for this opportunity. It made him be more aware of people. He hosted a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many of years to tell him about his job.,2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
880B2777CCD6,"The Seagoing Program provides many sights and fun times. Luke Bomberger enjoyed the trip very much. Reasons and details of what will be happening on the trip will be in the next couple paragraphs.

What many people may be thinking is there are no reasons. A reason to come is you can see very many exciting sights. Also its a one in a lifetime thing. If you are a sports fan then this is a thing fro you. They play baseball and voleyball.

Now its not done yet because someone out there is probably wondering what kinds of sights. A very facinating sight is the Pacific Ocean. Thats right when entering the Seagoing Program a sight you get to see is the Pacific Ocean. You also cross the Adlantic Ocean.

People are probably just wanting to know a little bit about the program. It is a very long program but it is enjoyable. There are also animals on the ship and if you are chosen to night wachman you have to check on the animals every hour. If its someone that likes animals then that person might enjoy the job.

The Seagoing Program is worth taking part is even if it is a long time. Now that people know a bit more about it more people may take part in it. There are reasons. There are also facts and details about it.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
1063A9794074,"Imagien, you're going on a little vacation trip with your faimly or friends. But there's a program called the UNRRA

that you wanted to do. So you put it aside for next year becuase you wanted to hang out with your friends or faimly. Some people wanted to do things like programs or groups but couldn't becuase they have ""other things"" to do that aren't that really important. So this paper should make you think twice about going or signing up for the UNRRA program.

My first reason to join the UNRRA program is becuase you get to help other people in other countries that are in need for help or care. The UNRRA helpes people from Europe to China and give them stuff like food, water, and other things becuase of the war that happened in Europe which we call World War 2.

My second reason why you should join the UNRRA program is becuase that you get to see other countries or cities that aren't pausible to travel on foot, car, or train. You can get to see other counties like China, Greece, Crete, and even Panama Canal for a matter of fact.

My last reason to why you should join the UNRRA program is that there's fun activeities on the UNRRA ship to do. There's vollyball, boxing, table-tennis tornaments, fencing, baseball, whistleing, reading, and other sports or relaxing things to do before we go back to get more supplies for the people in Europe and people in other countries.

D67DB04E5850,"""Seagoing Cowboys"" take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. When one becomes a Seagoing Cowboy, one's life is changed forever. There are three main reasons for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, and they are the beautiful places one might visit, the good cause that one is helping, and the fun one can have while doing the job. In this argument, I will elaborate on each of these reasons. First, I will expand on what is meant by beautiful places.

The first reason that I think one should become a Seagoing Cowboy is all of the beatiful places you might visit. When one is a Seagoing Cowboy, and one travels through Europe to help people, there are plenty of opportunity to visit beautiful places, such as Venice, Italy, where one can take a gondola ride through the streets of water, or the Acropolis, in Greece. One also occasionally finds beautiful places on one's way to another place, such as the Panama Canal, if one is going to China. That is the first reason for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Now, I shall elaborate on the second reason.

The second reason for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that one will be helping a good cause. War is a horrible thing, and sometimes, animals cannot be kept. Animals are very important beings, and we should try to protect them to our greatest extent. So going on trips just to help animals, which happens to be what Seagoing Cowboys do, is a very worthy cause. If one truly cares for animals, and one has the opportunity to help both animals and people, then why shouldn't one do so? There is no reason at all. Now, I shall elaborate on the third, and final reason for which I believe one should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

The third, and final reason, for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, is the fun that one will have while doing the job. When one is a Seagoing Cowboy, one often has spare time during the job, and there are plenty of opportunities to meet new people, and to have fun with them, playing games such as volleyball, and baseball. One might even find a lifelong friend, working as a Seagoing Cowboy. If someone does not have very many friends, they would have a chance of finding one as a Seagoing Cowboy. That is the third and final reason for which I think one should become a Seagoing Cowboy. Now, I shall finish this argument.

Seagoing Cowboys take care of cattle that has been sent overseas. There are several reasons for which one should become a Seagoing Cowboy, and they are the beautiful places one might visit, the worthy cause one is serving, and the fun one might have. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a good idea for all of us. Now why would anyone think otherwise?",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
2ACDDB5546EB,"Do you know what a Seagoing Cowboy is? They are more important than a regular cowboy. They are people who go out to sea after a war or something, and take care of animals that were shipped overseas. Doing this is a amazing experience and can change your life.

You might think that it is stupid, but I bet you do not think the military is stupid and that is who you are working for. It might not be out there battiling, but you are saving animals lives and providing food, clothing, transportation etc. When you bring them back to the people. Not only are you helping people you get to see amazing views. Plus there is more than one job on the ship that you can do.

While I was on the ship it was a huge adventure. Every now and then we get to go on tours and explore the world. When we were on the ship and there were not any animals aboard we played games, and just had fun while going to the next stop. We played games where we would have kept the animals. This is a serious matter, but you can also have fun and be responsible. When you are on the ship you have to be careful and responsible, You can have fun every now and then, but you cannot be playing all the time.

This was much more than adventure. I really got to see the world and the people there that had many needs. What the world really was that I had not payed much attention to. This is a lot better then trying to have two part time jobs. I am serving my country, and if you want to but do not want to fight I would say you should do this.

It is a once in a life time event. Coming from a small town and doing this. You can do it to, and you should. All you have to do voulenteer and maybe when you are out there and apply for the military they will keep you out there. Serving your country.

If you said yes to any of these things, then you should be part of the Seagoing Cowboys program. A Seagoing Cowboy is someone who takes care of horses, young cows, and mules while they are shipped over seas to places like Europe and China. You don't just have to take care of animals though.

On the trek over to Europe and back to America you never work all day and all night. You have shifts that you share with multiple other Seagoing Cowboys, and while you are on break, you can play games. To help pass time, we usually play baseball and volleyball games. We also host table-tennis tournaments. Some people even read, whittle, fence, and box. There is never a dull moment on board of our ship.

Once you unload the cattle, mules, and horses, you don't just go right back on the boat to America either. You can go and sightsee! I had the benefit of seeing the Acropolis in Greece, and got to ride a gondala in Venice, Italy. I got to do other things too such as take a tour of an exavated castle in Crete, and see the Panama Canal on my way to China!

On top of that, you become very close friends with the people on board of your boat. After all you are on the boat with them from a month to a little over two months. So, you guys will become great friends from playing baseball with them in your free time, or just because you have to share chores with them. Also, if you're an animal lover, you get to take care of the animals too!

Finally, a benefit of becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is you learn a lot too. You learn how to brave the storm of the harsh sea and how to take care of other people in need. It made me more aware of other people's needs and how to take care of them when they need help.

I can tell this by when the passage states,""It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies,a nimals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administartion). UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" That is the program that Don and I signed up for. This shows why I think you should join the Seagoing Coyboys program because you're helping a large amount of people by giving them what they need.

The third reason I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you can have fun by playing all sorts of games and more. In the text it states,""Luke also found time to have fun on board , especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the emty holds where animals had been housed."" After it states that it says,""Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, bowing, reading whittling and games also helped pass the time. This shows why I think you should join the Seagoing Coyboyws program because you can by playing all sorts of games and more.

The fourth reason think you should join the Seagoing Coyboys program is because you get the chance to go to new places. In the text it explains,""Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China."" See, when you join the Seagoing Coyboys program you get to go to many places because you have to deliver the suplies and animals to the different places. So this shows, and explains, why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get the chance to go to new places.

All in all this passage I have written for you shows why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it is a great way to sight-see, you're helping a large amount of people by giving them what they need,you can have fun playing all sorts of games and more, and you get the chance to go to new places.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

FECFE7AA5FEB,"World War ll was and horrible war because it happened all over the world. My name is Luke and I was a Seagoing Cowboy that help the ones that were affected by World War II. I think that you should be one too.

The Seagoing Cowboys are real amazing people that help other in need of help. The Seagoing Cowboys get to go to place that are far out like China and Italy. Also while you are in these amazing places you can sight see. That isn't the only thing you will be remembered by those people in those different places. You will be remembered as a hero to them because you helped them while they were in need.

Now I'm gonna tell you about my experience as a Seagoing Cowboy. The traveling was amazing because I got to go to different place and help people and see their homes. Then as I went to these different place I got to see the different building and sculptures that have probably been there for decades. So the thing that I did you can probably do as well or maybe even more.

Sea Going Cowboys Program!

I am Luke Bomberger, a seagoing cowboy. I am part of a big program known as the UNRRA who has hired seagoing cowboys. The UNRRA

allows us to help the countires who have been destroyed by war. I take care of the animals over sea and it is amazing to care for them and be known as a seagoing cowboy. Join me to help the others. Here are some reasons why you should become a seagoing cowboy.

First reason, this program is not for fun. It is for the people who are devastated right now in life. They just had to deal with with World War II. This war left many countries to pieces. The animals needed to be taken care of so that is where the seagoing cowboys come in. The seagoing cowboys care for the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Another reason, the seagoing cowboys are pleasured with free time to see beautiful sights and views. I got to see Europe,China,Italy and Greece. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece and take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. This is just a really nice way to enjoy myself while helping out the world in a good way as well. Lastly, we have fun on board with fellow seagoing cowboys. we will play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. This helps us pass time on board the sea.

Being a seagoingcowboy is dedication. It is hard work. It is fun and beautiful. Being a seagoing cowboy means you are helping the animals and the world in a wonderful way. You get to care for animals, see beautiful sights, play fun games, and help the people who just had to suffer from world War II.

CA2648956C9C,"2,000 animlals dead! What if you had to go and help take them across the sea?! Well Luke does, you can play games, you get to see different kinds of animals, and help different countries and see different things. Would you do this or would you not even think about it?

You get to play games, such as volley ball baseball, and table-tennis. Also fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling games. The other guys will play with you and things like that. Luke also is with his friend so you can talk to one of your friends. An if they wanted to do it with you.

You get to see different kinds of animlas. He gets to go to a whole bunch of different countries that got destroid. So they may need to take a girrafe or a monkey you've never seen before. You also get to take care of thoughs animals, and pet. You kinda get to be the owner of the animals.

You get to help different countries out and see different things. Like Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece. He got to take a Gandola ride in Vinece Italy, a city with streets of water. He also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal. He was happy that he was able to help people out.

So he tried it and he fell off a couple times but kept trying. And then finally he did it. He enjoyed it and definetally wanted to do it again. His freind also liked it. Luke also got to see a bunch of really cool animals not just him his freind did to. But some people didnt like the trip. Luke didnt know why. because it was amazing it was a life time excpiorience.

2C6F84563EBE,"Have you heard about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy? Well if one has I think that one should join because, it is really fun and there are a lot of perks of being Sea Cowboy. First off, after staying on the boat for a long time you dont just sit there on the way back we do a lot of different activities. Second off, If one gets drafted for service in a war, this could count for it. Last off, on ones way to a destination you get to see a lot of different old or prehistoric buildings that where made way before you were in the world. Now for why you should join being a Seagoing Cowboy.

Do you know how is said earlier that when you're done doing the load of animals? Well if you remember then we do a lot of fun games and other things. First of all, is we get to play a lot of sports such as baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing. Not only do we get to do sports activities but we also get too do acedimic things, for example reading. And lastly if your a more calm type of person we even whittle a little bit with our free times. Now for why it counts torwads doing service in the war.

You're probabley wondering why it counts torwads your service in the war? Well it counts for your service for a various amount of reasons. First, it counts for your service because you can spy on what the enemy is planning to attack us with. Also, It counts for your service because you can stop them from making any devious plans to attack america. Lastly, it will count torwads your service because, America could sneek in some there devious plans through live stock if they needed to if they couldn't come up with any other ways to attack the other country.

One may be asking right now well what kinda places you visit on these livestock trips to other countries? One might get to visit a bunch of prehistoric building or you might even see some of the newer landmarks but they are still pretty cool. First off, you will see a lot of prehistoric building or landmaks that we do not have in america. Second of all my reasons you might see some cool brand new buildings or landmarks that you can not visit in america. Now onto my reminder on why all this is true.

Remember, this is all true because you are hearing from a man who has experienced it all fom his adventues in the deep sea in many different oceanes throught the world. Like the pacific and atlantic oceans. First off, it is a first person perspective so you havve to believe its true.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
AF4DA284F168,"Why should luke join this program? Luke should join the program because its a opportunity of a lifetime. Plus, he gets to spend time with his friend. Lastly he will experence new things. Its a good thing he went on with going to do the program cause it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

This program will be a opportunity of a lifetime. In the prompt it states that he couldn't say no to his friend, and that he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime. Secondly Luke says ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable for a small-town boy."" Besides helping others he likes to taking water rides Venice, Italy. Thrirdly Luke was able to tour excavated castle in Crete and Marveled. But mostly went there to spend time with his friend.

Luke didn't go to the program he went there to see his friend. First he gets a phone call from his friend saying ""Hey would you like to come over to Europe then asked about cattle boating. His friend Don Reist confnced him to come out and see him, but not only see him but to go cattle boating with him. But yet not only did Luke do the program and gets to hang out with his friends he gets to experence new thngs.

Luke was able to experence new things while on this trip, and learn some to. World war 2 was over in 1945. Luke was a watchman and he had to check on the animals every hour. Luke found time to have fun the cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table tennis, and more.

In conclusion, I think Luke choose the right chose because he would still be doing the same thing being a cowboy and farming. Since he went cattle boating he's not the same in a good way. Also it was good to go see his friend and cattle boat with him to. These are my reasons why Luke should join.   ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
F4072681B524,"A Seagoing Cowboy is a cowboy who travels overseas to a different country and take animals/supplies there that they are in need of. This job takes a lot of work. You have to watch all the animals every hour, clean their stalls, and feed them. This job does take a lot of work, but it is a unique experience one will never forget. You get to Help other countries in need after the war, see amazing countries and sights , and have fun with new friends you get to meet while traveling. It is a great experience.

After World War ll, several countries were left in destruction. This meant that someone needed to help fast, and get the people food, animals, and other supplies that were needed. 44 nations came together as UNRRA, also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"", like myself. We help deliver horses, young cows, and mules to the countries in need. It feels so great to help other people, and I will never forget all the smiling faces I saw when I arrived with their animals. It is a wonderful sight.

When you visit several countries, you never realize how wonderful and amazing they can look, even after a war! Places like Europe, China, Greece, Italy, and the list countinues. After we deliver the animals, we get to have a little bit a of fun before we go back, so we get to go to tourist attractions, and popular cities in the country. I was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, where the streets are made up of water. I also got to see the Acropolis in Greece. Those trips were pretty special! There are so many great things to see and do in every country, so no matter where you go, you will have a great adventure exploring the cities, and having a ton of fun!

While being on a boat, traveling to a country, you have to watch over the animals every so often. That is not the case on your way back, when the animals are gone from your boat at the country you just visited. Since the animals are gone, you can do whatever you want to do to make the time pass. We do things such as table-tennis, volleyball, boxing, fencing, baseball, reading, and more fun games. You really can't play things games without people to play with, which is a great way to make friends. Since you probably don't know the people working with you, you can get to know them, and make new friends. This is one of my favorite parts of being a Seagoing Cowboy, because without becoming friends with your co-workers, you job isn't fun. It's a great way to open up, and whats more fun then going over-seas with your friends and having a good time?

In conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is an amazing experience because you get to help others in need after the war, see amazing places/sights, and have tons of fun while making new friends with the people you work with. You will have so many great memories of your time at every country. Become a Seagoing Cowboy today!",5,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

D284335D1A10,"Hello there, my name is Luke Bomberger, and I'm here to convince you to participate in my favorite program, the Seagoing Cowboys. To be apart of this program is an opportunity of a lifetime. It all started when the 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. We went everywhere, including Europe, China, Greece, and even Italy! I even have a spectacular story about me in Greece. I turned eight-teen before arriving in Greece, which ment that I could be in the military, but when they realized that I was a Seagoing Cowboy, they told me to just keep doing it for my service.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy I was even the one who made nine whole trips. The most of any Seagoing Cowboy! Being apart of this, was one of the greatest opportunities for a small-town boy like me. It was helping out on my Aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for the hardwork for the animals like by feedding and water them two or three times a day, feeding the horses bales of hay and bags of oats, and the stalls even had to be clean. One thing I can say about that part, is that it did keep me busier than ever!

There were too many fun times we had, but there were times that we didn't. On my second trip, I served as a nightwatchman, and my only job was to check on all the animals every hour. After I made one of my hourly reports, I slid down a very slick ladder. My heart was like a bullet beating so fast in my chest. I almost fell into the Atlantic Ocean. My ribs were so cracked, they said that they can't even work for the next couple of days, so I didn't.

Although there were scary parts of all the trips, there were fun parts too! I always had fun on board, especially after the animals had been unlodaded. We would play baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games all helped pass the time. It really opened up the world for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

A lot of people love doing this so I think that you would love it to you can even get your friends to do it with you. Some of the places you get to go to is China, and across the Atlantic Ocean.

It takes about two weeks to travel the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern coast of the United States. It takes about a month to travel to China. You have to get stalls that you can put your animals into so you can feed them and wash them. Once you drop your animals off you can start to get back on the boat and sail back. The fun part is of sailing back is you get to do fun things such as table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games to help pass time. Also it is great to get outside and adventure and open up the world to yourself.

I am trying to encourage you to become a seagoing cowboy because if you like to travel and be on a boat with animals then this is the job for you. If you do become a seagoing cowboy remember its a lot of responsibility that you have to take care of. When the job is over you get to play games on your way home.

8C5D936AB51C,"Do you know what a seagoing cowboy is? Luke Bomberger was a ''seagoing cowboy'',a person who helped foreign countries of sea's after WWII. Luke was apart of the UNRRA, (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)to help foreign country's who have been left in ruins get back on their feet. On his way to Europe,he had to cross the large and vast Atlantic Ocean.

To pass time on there way to Europe they played games such as,Table-Tennis,fencing,and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass time. The way Luke got into the seagoing cowboy business,was his friend asked him if he wanted to join him,and he couldn't pass up this surreal oppurtunity. But, the downside was he he had to travel the rambunctious sea's. The ship Luke and Don boarded to take these cattle over to Europe is the SS Charles W. Wooster.

Reasons join this program are that you get to help others get back on their feet in times of disaster such as war,hurricane,tsunami,nuclear disaster,or other types of disasters that may happen. But their also some dangers to be aware of. During one of Luke's journey's to Europe he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. If it weren't for a small strip of metal he would have fallen into the dark Atlantic Ocean. But,besides broken ribs he was glad he wasn't sleeping with the fishes,literally!

It's also an adventure to. During another one of his trips he got to boat around the watery ""streets"" of Venice,Italy in a gondola. Also while in Greece he visited a excavated castle. He also marveled the Panama Canal on his way to

China. But,what came most in handy is that he used to help his Aunt Katie on her farm as a boy so, Luke was prepared for the hard work.

So as a conclusion to this story, I would hope you join an organization that helps others in need, especially countries overseas. Even though this job might be hard, your making a difference in our world and there's. You could join an orginization like UNRRA,or just simply join and orginization that helps new Americans,like immigrants from foreign countries fit in in our society today in America. That would be a good example our country could set for other countries. This should be our goal for every thing and anything. Are goal should be to help others and just not ourselves. We need to stop being selfish and help other's get back on there feet if their in times of need. This is the example we should set as The United States of America.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

My second reason is that you would be able to see global landmarks throughout your journey. Luke was a witness and he said that, ""the trips were an unbeleivable oppurtunity for a small town boy."" You would learn what it is like to travel far and wide across the Atlantic Ocean.

My last reason is that not only would you be able to see global landmarks, but you would also be able to enjoy yourself throughout the trip. The passage states that the cowboys played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and reading, whittling, or games also helped pass some of the time.

358455152D34,"Its a great idea to participate is the Seagoing Cowboys program because, it is fun seeing all the places ,and taking care of the animals. It is a long trip ,but it is so worth going. You won't even get board because, there is still activities to do on the ship.

It is such a good idea to go and participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because, it is a splended journey seeing all the sights and the beautiful outside. It is not only fun seeing te places ,but you might be able to even go and visit the places you go and stop at on this journey. Sure it might sound boring because your on a ship for so long ,but it is so worth it once you get on and go on the journey.

This journey is not only about sight seeing but also about taking care of the animals. You might be thinking why would I join just to take care of some animals ,but what I think is that it is teriffic taking care of some animals. If your still not agreeing with me I will support my oppinion so you can understand. It sees in the story, Luke knew it was an opportunity of a life time, so he went for the journey. It also sees in the story, but being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger, it opened up the world to him. He sees, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity.' ""It made me more aware of the peple of other countries and their needs."" I think I made myself clear that it is much more better than is sounds ,and it touches your heart going on this adventure.

This propgram takes a while to reach its destination but while your on the ship you feel like time goes by fast. The activities you can do on the ship are as followed; you can play baseball and vollyball games in the empty hold where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. Those activities also help pass time.

I really think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because, it is fun seeing the places they go and visit, and taking care of the animals, not only those things but feel your heart being touched on this amazing journey.       ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

UNRRA hired seagoing Cowboys to take care of the animals that were shied overseas. Those were the things you would've had to do.

The thing that you want to do is help people out you would have the opportunity to go to Europe and China. It would take about 2 weeks to cross Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. So caring for the animals is a nice and helpful thing that would keep you busy. Stalls had to be cleaned out every single day and you have to feed them. Helping out at a farm would prepare you for hard work. You would be very happy in Europe on a cattle boat exspeacally if you are a man. You would get little hurt but not for long.

C0585BD7CC08,"Some people say that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be a dull job.

What is a Seagoing Cowboy you ask, well it is a person who delivers cattle to people in need.

It was World War 2 and people around the world needed help with ways to get food.

I felt like I could do something for them, so I decided to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you feel that way then I encourage you to join the Sea Cowboys.

There were many reasons why joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a cool thing and here is one.

For the experinces!

I was a small town boy and had not got to see a lot of the big world that we live in.

The sign up sheet said we would not only help the people in need we would also get to see some of the amazing sights in that country.

That was no lie!

On my journeys I saw the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and a recently excavated castle in Crete.

I also got to ride in a gondola in Venice, Italy.

Another thing that not many people could say is that you crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice.

Another reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you have a chance to serve your country without killing another person.

On my first trip as a Seagoing Cowboy, I turned 18. That is when you are old enough to be drafted to the army.

When the draft board found out I was being a Seagoing Cowboy, they told me to do that as my service.

If you don't like the thought of shooting people, then maybe you could be a Seagoing Cowboy. You would help people get food, not have to shoot anybody, and serve your country.

Now you know some reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

I hope to see you aboard soon.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
6788E7AE79A4,"A few reasons why you should be a seagoing cowboy are you can join the military, see different people, go different places. meat different people, help people out after wars, when you have free time you can build things, play games when you have free time, take care of animals and if you are a city person mabey after you go home you might want to be a counterty person.

If you want to join the military you might be able to when you are done being a seagoing cowboy. You'll be stronger from lifting feed. The people on the ship might give you some training. You will be able to see new people, meat new people and go places that you've never been befor all while going to help people get some things back after a war, whitch is the right thing to do.

You might like to build thing, and if you do you should be a seagoing cowboy. When you have free time on your hands you can do what ever you want with in in reason. When you have no animals to take care of you can build more, or you can play games. Some of the games are: boxing, table tinnise, baseball, softball, fencing and whittling. All of the games are really fun.

Some people want to become countery people, but they don't know how to take care of animals, but if their willing to lear than they should become a seagoing cowboy. Other people just like to take care of animals. If you are one of those people then a seagoing cowboy is the right job for you.

5F5C3F9DD1D6,"I think Luke should convince people to join because you will be on a boat with other people. Plus, helping countries recover after world war 2. Help them recover food supplies, animals, and more"".

In the artical it says ""44 nations joined together to form UNRRA to care of animals shiped over seas"". SO, they hire people called ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

They were people who had help feed and protect animals such as horses, young cows, and mules. Also, if you join not only will you help the animals but, you would have lots of fun. Thats why Luke should convince people. He got to see cool places like the Acroplis in Greece and he also Took a ride on the gondola ride in venice, Italy. Witch is a streets filled wth water. He also, went to a ""excavated castle in crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China"". He got to view beautiful places on his way to China and still cared for the animals. Luke has done fun things and been very helpful with the animals.

So, to him feeding animals he also did more then you would imagine thats why people might not want to go because of they think you would only be on a ship for months with fifthy animals. But, he did so much more then clean, feed, and watch or guard the animals. I mean he went on trips to places people who could never afford, or who always dreamed to go! Luke got to see all that for Free only price he had to pay was to love and take care of the animals for countries that need them. All creatures are valueable and should never be treated in a way it dosn't diserve. Who cares if you think siting on a boat with mutiple other people and animals for a month is a waste of time. LUke was on a boat that had about 335 horses. I mean imagine if something had happen to the ship and it sunk! All those deaths of the people and animals that could have saved Millions gone in a flash. This is why I think its a good idea for Luke to convince others to join.

It says that it was a "" opportunity of a lifetime."" It's not normal everyday that you would get a chance to go on ship and see places you never seen before. It's rare to happen but, thats why you should jump up and take it it's one opportuity you will probly never get again. So, don't take the chance thinking this kind of event would ever occur again so do what you want to do and what you think is right. He had visited nine trips on his trip on a boat in a certain amount of days. Maybe others could visit more places like ten. Even, see things on your journey see animals you have never seen before. Smell odd things you have never had smell before ever in your lifetime. Sure you might get home sick but, you will go back home wants it is over. Think of all the people you saved. Also, the countries too would recover and get stronger. So, let the others know what you have seen on this trip. Join and you too will start your quest to China. Today now start helping others.

In conclusion, this is why Luke should convince others to join because all of these reasons to join for fun, and for helping animals get to were they need to go to help even more people. Theres no way he shoudn't convince others. Just tell them it's for a good cause. You even get to wonder places on way to your destination.

Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He know it was an opportunity of a lifetime. He had to go. It was 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

0F0C5943C90B,"Hello, my name is Luke Bomberger, and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. The Seagoing Cowboys took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped across the ocean. My friend, Don, and I signed up. I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you could save a life.

The Seagoing Cowboys help people in need, especially after World War ll, it feels so nice to help people in need, if you sign up you could feel it, too. Since we ship animals and take care of them around the world, we provide people with good livestock, that maybe, could save a life! And, if you're bored, the animals keep you busy. Also, there is some incredible sightseeing around the world.

Another reason you would want to sign for the Seagoing Cowboys program is you could see some truly, incredible things! Besides helping people, I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China! I saw some beautiful things like, the Acropolis in Greece, taking the gondola ride in Italy, that has streets of water, I toured an excavated castle in Crete, and I loved the Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. That may be beautiful, but if you still aren't convinced, the danger that it puts in your life makes your heart pump!

My third reason, is the danger and heart-skipping-a-beat experiences that this program gives you! If you're bored with your life, think about the Seagoing Cowboys program. The reason I say this, is one rainy night, after I made my hourly report to my captain, I suddenly slid down a slippery ladder on my back. I would've fell off, if it wasn't for a strip of metal that caught me! I would have been in the deep water of the Atlantic by now. I felt happy to be alive, and I will never forget that moment.

My last reason is that I had so much fun, and it was a truly amazing, never-forgetting experience. On return trips we played games in the hold where the animals were. We played baseball, volleyball, and other games like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and more, that got us ready for our next adventure. This program gave me a better-than-amazing experience, and I would love to share it with you!

Now, I should conclude my thoughts. You should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys so you could help people in need, see amazing things, such as the Acropolis in Greece, so you can have a dangerous but amazing life, and so you can have fun and have a never forgetting experience. Sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys, now!

""How about this, I will talk it over wiht my parents and see what they think, then I will make the final decision. Ok?"" he explained.

""Ok. Meet me at the Big Tree tomorrow at 3."" The we bothed walked off.

I really hoped that Sam would agree.

We would be like the three muskateers! I thought.

Don, Sam, and I have been best friends since I could remember. DOn had already been my neighbor, so when Sam moved in a couple houses down we decided to start being friend swith him. I'm glad we did.

Don and I have been apart of the UNRRA for a while now, and we were home for a brake. Our only mission while being home is to try and get people to join. We already got a couple, but we needed more. There is always work to be done on the ship.

""Hi Mom."" I said walking into the kitchen. ""Dinner smells good.""

""Good. How was your day?"" she asked. ""Anybody new recruited?""

We ate dinner and then cleaned the dishes off.

""Mom, is it ok if i go back out to town?"" I asked.

""Sure. Just be back before dark.""

I went to the common area because there is normally still a lot of people ther at this time eating, playing with animals, or little kids running around. I walked into the common and sure enough, people were there.

As I was walking, I felt a tap on my back.

""Looks like we had the same idea, Luke!"" It was Don.

""Yeah! So glad you're here. Have you gotten anyone?"" I asked.

""Yeah actually. Those men sitting over there talking."" He pointed to 3 men chatting on a bench.

""Hello, and sure. Tell me about it."" he said, with a kind smile.

""What UNRRA stands for is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration and what we do is carry animals on ships to different places. FOr example, we went to Greece and unloaded there.

It was getting dark, so Don and I decided to head home together. We talked about small things like where we might go nest, how long we will continue doing this, and we also talked about other jobs we might want.

I got home and went to my room. It was a long day, so I went to bed shortly after.

A lot of things can happen and you know what, I dont want to get car sick if I were you. Also what about home, theres opportuneities here. What about the people who are in need right now. There is so much you could do right here right now. You don't have to go somewhere els just too help somone I mean there are people out here that are in need bad but your going to Greece just too help other people. It's a good idea but just think about what you good do here. I'm one of those people who love helping others but I know that I could just help someone here because going to Greece!! I wouldin't want too because I already have more than enuogh people I could help, things I could see, things I could do. There is just so much to do, and to see. I know that if you just think there will be something to do for our community just like that. Like I said you don't need to got to Greece to see that!

Those were some of my resons why you shouldin't go to Seagoing Cowboys program. Like I said,it would be fun but think about what could happen before you go and give it a try.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
E11874A13D2F,"Do you like helping people while having fun? If you do then I've just the right job for you. This wonderful job is called the UNRRA. There are many reasons why you should join the UNRRA to be a seagoing Cowboys. Some in which include trips, hanging out, ETC. Today we are going to be going over or covering if you will some of the reasons that you should join the seagoing cowboys in the UNRRA.

First of all many people say that you whould nothing out of this organization, but you really get a lot of things out of this organization. One reason you should join the seagoing cowboys is you get many trips around the world. For example, in "" A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke said that he got to go all around the world like: China, Europe, Greece, ETC. You actuall get to go all over the world.

Second is that you get to hang out with people you might not know, and who knows you might make a friend, meet your new best friend or even find that perfect someone for you. If you do meet someone then you would be able to hang out a lot. You could have your first date with that perfect someone in a different contry. How cool whould that be! If you don't believe me you can go back to thee text and look in paragraph 5. If I recall it says that he was able to go see many touring spots, and had a lot more free time then you think.

Speaking of touring that brings me to my next point you are able to go sight seeing and touring. You can go to many places in China and Europe. For example, If you are in Europe and you are close or near Italy you can go and see the leaning tower of piza. For lunch you can go and get some delisous Italian pizza. Now to me that sounds like the perfect day.

Others might argue by saying that all of this is too expensive and it cost a lot of money. What the people that say this don't see is that the organization pays for most of the cost. Sometimes I bet you that the people that go on this trip don't even spend a dime or a penny.

In coclusion as you can see by all of the evidence I have showed that there is no doubt in the world that you should not join this organization UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. To me all of this kind of sounds fun like a vacation. It doesn't sound like a job at all it sounds refreshing to be able to be at work while doing soomething that seems like fun and a vacation. In conclusion judging by everything I have stated I think that you should join the seagoing cowboys. I know that I will join the seagoing cowboys, will you join?

Being a sea cowboy isn't alway easy, but it's worth all the hardwork and effort. It's a great job for any hardworkers and is fun for anyone who decides to join the Seagoing Cowboy program. No one will regret joining the program.

Those who like to sail this is a great job. It will be a couple weeks on the water to sail and experience the waters of many oceans and seas. One trip is to China and takes two weeks. That is a great time to enjoy sailing. When not working, on the way back, all sea cowboys can play volleyball, baseball, and other games too. It's not always work so they can have freetime during their travels.

Not only is it great for sailors, but it's also good for animal people. People who like to work with animals or just take care of animals have a great oppourtunity too. One of the animal jobs is a night watchman. They checkup on all the animals once every hour during the night. That means it's not just all work. There are other animal jobs too, like feeding the animals and giving them water. There are great things for animal workers with the Seagoing Cowboy program.

With the sailors and animal caretakers there are oppourtunities to see the world. The sea cowboys travel to many places to ship animals. When they get to the place where they are shipping to, cowboys can see the places and explore forein lands. Not only do they get to see other places, they also get to see the waters of many places and may see lands off in the distance.

There are many great oppourtunities for everyone! Seeing the world is fun, even if someone has to work during it.

Caring for animals is great for people who have or like animals. If a cowboy just wants to sail they can man the ship. Being part of the Seagoing Cowboys program is amazing for anyone. Being a part of this program is a great way to have fun and earn money at the same time. Come be a sea cowboy to help many nations in need.

E07F813AA76F,"All young adults should consider participating in ""Seagoing Cowboys.""

They would most likely like it a lot.

Luke Bomberger certainly did.

""Seagoing Cowboys"" is a program where young adults take a boat to Europe.

On the way there, they raise horses, cows, and mules.

When they get there, the cattle are taken to countries who need them.

I wish I was old enough to do that.

The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" help people in need.

There are millions of people out there who need a horse to eat, or a cow to get milk.

They might need a mule to help carry baskets of food or buckets of water that are too heavy for a single person to lift.

If a person were to join, they could see many unique and interesting places.

They would be very lucky.

A lot of people in the U.S. don't even have enough money to visit sites within our country.

Luke got to visit the Acropolis in Greece, take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, tour a castle in Crete, and even see the Panama canal!

It would also be an incredible experience.

How many people get to raise cattle and sail the Atlantic Ocean at the same time?

You may say that there would be no time for fun, but on the way back they do fun games in the space where the animals were housed.

Some of the games they play include sports, so you would also get exercise.

Some of the games they play are: baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

Some might say it is very dangerous at sea.

All you have to do is be extremely careful and you won't get hurt.

If you do, then the other ship members will take extra good care of you.

""What if you go to a place with nothing interesting?"" you may ask.

Make it interesting.

Play in a field, run around for a bit, just chat.

The place is only as interesting as you make it.

E74454635A15,"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a fun and unique job. Like Luke you got to help many people and visit many places. Such as when Luke mentions that he took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy meant that he supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowboy is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowboy was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that he would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept him busy along with other things he had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to him. He also so said that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

CB31FAA78E5B,"My argument about Lukes point of view is that you should always try soething new or something you always wanted to do. In this story Luke is working at a store and his friend invited him to go on a cattle boat to Europe after World War 2. He knew this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. So he went.

You could see how he was feeling just by the way the author put it. He was exicited and he was ready. When Luke found out that he was to take care of horses, young cows, and mules he knew he would be good at it because he worked at his aunts farm. He thought this would be a good time to help out with this disaster. Luke went overseas just to do someting helpful for the problems people had. All the stuff people had were gone because of the World War 2.

He had some rough times on way, like running into storms, big waves and other stuff that happen in the ocean, but hey it was worth it. But some thingss got severe, when he broke his ribs during a storm. He took nine trips on the cattle boat. And this was big for him because he was a small - town boy. He also knew he was helping out thousands of people. Over seas, Luke was very busy with the animals. He had to feed them 2 to 3 times a day. Thats a lot of work for young boy.

Just by reading this article you can tell how much work you will have but your doing it for people who can't do this stuff. So what, it may be hard, it may be boring, but those people need your help. Thats why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Luke was brave enough to do this kind of thing just because of 1 thing, he had faith in him, his best friend, and the people.

""Seagoing Cowboys program,I am going to list reasons why you should join by telling you my excpriecnces .I've had good and bad ones but at the end it was the best choice I've made.

One reason is that you get to help many people and animals have a better and here is my example,It took about two weeks to cross the the alantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China .Caring for animals during the crossings kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled upfrom the lower holds of the ship,Also stalls had to be cleaned.

Another reason is that you get to venture around the world and see many different things and places,like I got to see Europe and china,but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to me.

And one final example is that as you venture around the world and take care of animals you also get more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

Before you get to have all the fun and free time, you have to take care of the animals. That means feeding and watering them, but there are some risks. On my second trip, I was put on duty as a night watchman, and one rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slipped on a wet step and fell down the ladder on my backside. My heart was beating faster than ever as I shot towards an opening on the side of the ship. Luckily, there was a small strip of metal along the edge that stopped me from plunging into the Atlantic, but I had cracked my ribs, disabling me to do work for a few days.

D75B4D14CCAB,"Becoming a seagoing cowboy means that you would take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas to other countries that need to recover their animals from World War II. It may sound like a lot of work but is can be very rewarding. On my many trips as a seagoing cowboy, I was able to spend a lot of my time with friends and was able to do some sightseeing in other countries. I was also able to learn a lot about animals just from taking care of them. I hope that you choose to become a seagoing cowboy.

One reason for becoming a seagoing cowboy would be that you would learn a lot about animals. I was able to learn a lot of body language from the animals. I now know when an animal is nervous or angry. I can tell when a horse is calm and happy. Knowing animal body language may help you not get a broken bone from being kicked by an angry horse or cow. You will also learn how to take care of the animals. I already knew how to take care of some of the animals from working on my aunt's farm, but I learned how to care for animals a lot faster from doing it hundreds of times everyday.

Another reason that was fun about becoming a seagoing cowboy was that I was able to spend a lot of time with my friends on the trip back to America. All of my friends and I loved playing sports, like volleyball and table-tennis, in the empty holds where we kept the animals. We also shared stories and games that some of us had never even heard of. I learned many fun stories and games that I now pass on to others today.

My last reason to convince you to become a seagoing cowboy would be the sightseeing. While we were in another country, we had some time to go sightseeing. I was able to tour an excavated castle in Crete. I took a gondala ride in Italy and saw the Panama Canal. I also learned a lot about culture. I learned how bad things can be in other countries after wars. It made me more aware of the people and their needs in other countries.

In the article Luke must take care of horses, young cows, and mules by giving them water and food, cleaning the pens, and pulling hay and supplies from the lower decks. Seagoing Cowboys not only take care of animals they have to watch out for one another. In the passage Luke was almost knocked overvoard but thankfully a strip of metal caught him and his crewmates pulled him back aboard.

The people who do sign up to become Seagoing Cowboys get to travel around the world and learn about new cultures, eat new and interesting foods, and even get to see amazing landscapes and structures. In the passage Luke got to see the Panama Canal, a castle in Crete, and even spend time in China and Europe. Luke took nine trips from one place and back again-that's the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

Seagoing Cowboys have great experiences. They learn new thingss and see new places. Plus who doesn't love working with animals. It would be a great experience and lots of fun to be a boy or man to travel to new countries and learn new things. We hope to see you on our next trip and have a great time.

There's always a reason to do the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Sight seeing is one of the reasons. You get to go see different places and wonder around new countries. You might get to see Venice, Italy the city of water. The Panama Canal in China. Might see the Acroplis in Greece.

Helping others is another activity that we do for the progam. Helping rebuild countries after a terrible event. Taking care of animals. Delievering animals to different cities or towns.

When your on the ship you get to play games. Playing baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals lived before. Having tournaments for table-tennis. Reading books or doing other games to pass the time.

There are some many reasons why you should participate. If I were you, I would want to be in the program. Playing games, seeing other places. You wouldn't know of what your missing.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Luke's friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime. World War II just ended and a lot of countries needed help, so Luke and his friend started to help. The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of all of the animals that would be on the boat. Luke and Don then signed up.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Luke was happy that he was helping people but he was also really excited to see Europe and China. Luke also went to Venice, Italy and he even toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Helping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy really helped and prepared him for this hard work that he is doing today. Then soon enough, Luke got a new job on the boat. Luke's job was check on all the animals every hour.

Then one night Luke's life almost ended. Luke was going to go see the captain but he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke almost flew overboard but a metal along the edge stopped him.

Luke had fun on board also. The cowboys would play volleyball, baseball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

Luke was happy for what he has done. It made Luke more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That awareness always stayed with him. Luke saved peoples lives. Luke is a hero.",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

We started our expedition in August of 1945. I got to see many places during the program. That included a gondola ride in Venice, an Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and much much more. This program is excellent if you aren't a very worldly person, but even if you are it's great to see more!

This program is also good to be more involved in excercise. You have to feed and water the animals two are three times a day. Also, stalls have to be cleaned. When you spend so much time with the animals it sort of creates a bond between the two of you. However it just wasn't work and work, sometimes you have to take a break. Whenever the animals were unloaded we got to do fun activities like baseball, volleyball, fierce table-tennis tournaments, you get the idea. So that's how to get an easy workout!

This program makes you realize how much we take for granted. People are constantly starving or dehydrated, whenever we think that food and liquid is something easy to come by. Also countries are suffering under constant warfare and are very vurnerable. This program allows you to understand what it's actually like to really suffer.

These are the reasons that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It really opens you up, by helping people all over the world. This is why I believe more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Luke worked two part-time jobs, so you can tell that he is hard working. Then his friend Don Reist gave him the opportunity of a life-time. To be a Seagoing Cowboy.

The Seagoing Cowboy program is where people go around the world on a boat to help people and animals. After World WarII, it was a great opportunity to go and help people and animals from other continents recover from this catastrophe. Reasons to become a seagoing Cowboy is, you get to help people and animals in need of assistance. Helping people is a good thing to do and it makes you feel good and the people you help feel good too. You also get to explore all of the exotic, unique places around the world when you are traveling. Those reasons are few of many.

""Seagoing Cowboys, to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up."" paragraph 2. Luke and Don felt a need to help and put their time and effort to help these people and animals.

Even though Luke and Don care for people and love animals, some people wouldn't take the opportunity. Most people love animals and helping people, but some just don't like animals or they are too selfish to tak some time to go around the world and help other people with things that you already have and they don't. Or people get seasick or are just too paranoid to go on a boat because they think it is going to sink.

Besides, the portion that has most people who would do something like Luke and Don, are people around us and we will always have those kind of people.

To Luke, his life changed after this wonderful experience. His adventures opened up the world for him. ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" And that awresess stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""

The thing that this eighteen year-old boy enjoys coming back to get more supplies because the Cowboys play volleyball in the pens where the animals are located. They also play table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

When luke is helping people they also get to go to special places such as the Acropolis in Greece was special,""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city of streets of water."" He also toured and excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

317BC7AD88EF,"""The Cowboy Program""

This isn't just any type of cowboy program, this is a cowboy who rode the waves. I think it would be good for kids to come helpout at this program. It can make you smart and learn about things you might not know.

This boy named Luke went with his best friend. His life totally changed. I'm now going to tell you why you should come. What they did their was they helped people. The boy boys played fun games like, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. They did that to help pass time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much of an adventure. Now here are some places they went that I think you might like. It took the group two weeks to travel across the Alantic ocean. They went to China which took a month. Also the program went to Greece to get their Military service. For World War ll in 1945, they went to Europe.

Now I'm going to tell you things they did to help out that you might like to do, if you like to do chores. Luke served as a night watchman. Also he went and checked on the animals every hour. Also to keep Luke busy about the animals is they had to be fed or watered two or three times a day. Another thing is bales of hay and bag of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. The stalls also had to be cleaned.

Lastly I'm going to tell you why Luke went on this ship and why you might want to. Luke went on this trip because he wanted to help out is best friend. Also he knew it was possibly the only chance he would ever get to get to go. Another reason is Luke thought it might be good work him. I think he also went on this trip to help out 44 other countries to recover their items. This was a very important job and Luke did a good job. I bet if you tried this, you would too.

Do you think you would ever want to go on this trip? I would, it sounds like you have to do work, but you still can have a lot of fun with the trip. I think it is also important to help out with other things. Maybe some day you should try this some day if you ever get the opportunity.         ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

You get to be with animals, get to ride in a boat, and also get to see many archetectial designs, such as the Great Wall of China or the Eiffel Tower. If you ever get the chance to participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program, I suggest that you do.

Seagoing Cowboys lets you stay with animals when you ride in the boat. When I was working, I got to work with animals such as horses and cattle. There are many animals to work with. There are also many things that you must do for the animals. You must feed them, water them, and clean out their stalls. The animals usually eat oats or wheat. Animals can be hard work, but they can also give you something fun to do.

Seagoing Cowboys program is all by sea. You pick up the animals on land and then, you set sail and hit the water. If you have never ridden in a boat, then I suggest that you take this oppertunity in life. Boats can be very fun. They rock back and forth like a rocking chair and float on water. Boats are proably the most important thing that we need for the journey. If we did not have the boats, then we are out of luck.

If you have never seen any national landmark, the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great way to try to see a landmark. On the trips I have taken, I have gotten to see the Acropolis, parts of China, and have done and seen many other things. One of my favorites was riding in a gondola, in the city of water, Venice. The landmarks are important because they remind us of friendship. For example, France gave us the Effiel Tower to us as a peace treaty? Well, now you know.

The Seagoing Cowboy program lets you be with animals, get to ride on a boat, and gives you the oppertunity to see national landmarks like the Great Wall of China.

So I thought, if I went and was serving people and helping them survive, would it be good for me, and then I knew that God was calling me to do this and I wanted to do what was right in the eyes of the Lord, so I said, ""Yes.""

Once I got there, I heard that there were 44 nations and that we were going to form UNRRA, wich meant, (the United Nations Relief nd Rehabilation Administration).

Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small stirp of metal along the edge stopped slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. He was happy to be alive."" After that terrible time Luke was brave enough to keep working on the ship later. Which takes a lot of guts to do or to be brave like Luke.

In the end Luke was very bliss to be working with his friend. Luke says in paragraph eight ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" In that sentence he was more worried about the people than himself. Not a lot of people have the guts to do that. In conclusion, Luke was brave to work to all the stuff over seas and give the people who were affected in war what they needed no matter what. ",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
9F617A813225,"A seagoing Cowboy is an amazing opportunity in life, but what is a seagoing cowboy and what are the perks of doing this? Get ready for this wild ride.

In 1945, World War two was over in Europe, but many people had nothing left. Then, 44 nations joined together to make he UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.) The Organization decided to hire ""Seagoing Cowboys."" Seagoing Cowboys were used to take care of Horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. The Cowboys had a important job and sometimes you got special perks of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you are over the age of eighteen and were being drafted for the military, this could count as you military service and don't forget about all the fun you can on board. After all the animals were unloaded many of the cowboys played sports, like baseball and volleyball where the animals used to live. There was also fencing, table tennis, boxing, reading, and whittling, and many other games. While you were working you could see Europe and China. But you could also take a gondola ride in Venice, or see the Acropolis in Greece and that is pretty cool.

In Conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboys has its perks. So go out there and going the Seagoing Cowboys.             ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
F460F653B33D,"You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. One of the reasons is that you get to see amazing historical places that you otherwise wouldn't get to see. I loved that you got to take care of the animals. You also should know of the dangers of being a Seagoing Cowboy. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

As a Seagoing Cowboy I got to travel and see many different places. I got to see Europe and China. I even got to see the Acropolis in Greece! I also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I even got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and I had the oppurtunity to marvel the Panama Canal on my way to China. The sights were amazing!

I loved caring for the animals. It kept me busy during the crossings. They all had to be fed and watered three times a day. My job also required me to drag the bales of hay and the bags of oats up from the lower holds. I also had to clean the stalls, which isn't as bad as it sounds. I loved taking care of the animals.

You must beware though of what the dangers are of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I was making my hourly report to the captain when I slid down a slippery ladder. My heart began to race as I looked down and saw the dark blue sea. I was only saved by a small strip of metal. I would have flown overboard! I mean what would you expect when you are out at see.

You shoud become a Seagoing Cowboy. There may be dangers, but there is also great fun. You could go to places you have always wanted to go and see things you have always wanted to see. You would probably also love forming a bond and taking care of the animals. It is an amazing way to help people to recover after this terrible tragedy that destroyed everything they owned. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

6ED32B9136F8,"Have you ever thought of being a Seagoing Cowboy. When being a Seagiong Cowboy ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" (from paragraph 9). You didn't just see the world you go and help it. If you like helping people this is a thing for you. Seeing people and helping them feels great too not because you get apprecation from them, but since you get to know you did good for the world. Just keep that in mind.

It is a dangerous job though. ""One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide, keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic. I was happy to be alive. But I couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" paragraph 7. That shows Seagiong is a dangerous job and it's very serious trying not to get hurt.

In the process we do have a little fun when we aren't doing much. ""I found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys and I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed."" paragraph 8. That was some fun on board we do to pass time. Since we were around the world we could go cite seeing and things like that away from the ship. These trips introduced this small town boy to the world.

The world is a wonderful place to see. Like I said off board we'd go cite seeing. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special."" paragraph 5. Seeing the world is speical and not most people can afford to do that.

Thoes are the reasons you should join. When you do this it's adventurous, scary, fun, and amazing. Those words explain it all. So join the Seagoing Cowboys. If you don't you would be missing on a great oppurtinity. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Lukes favriot thing was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. Luke also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Caring for animals always kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day.

BE24907D6684,"From Luke's experieance he know's that he is lucky to life in america. And that other people in other countires don't get a chance to live a good life. So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.

In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!

After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.

Being a

Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever!

FFFD0AF13501,"In the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke was a young seventeen-year-old boy who couldn't turn down the opportunity of a lifetime to go to Europe and help with the horses.

Some of the reasons to join the seagoing cowboys is that they get to see tons of awesome landmarks. If you love horses and cattle then is most likely the job for you. You get to enteract with them and feed them care for them like they were your own. Even if you just want to help out your world out then this could be the job for you.

It's amazing how much stuff you can do there to when the jobs done you might be able to look at the pretty things there. Sometimes if your lucky you have to go right through town so you get to see the pretty things on the way there. When it's time to go back home you play games where the horses were cared for. If seagoing cowboys were still around I would love to be one so badly. It would be so cool if I could be one too.

In conclusion, all i'm saying is that the seagoing cowboys would be something worth doing and worth while. You can go so many places and you rarely go to the same place ever. It sounds so cool and you never know where you'll go, hey you might just go to Egypt and see the pyrimids you just never know.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Luke had a friend named Don, wich if it wasn't for Don luke wouldn't be out there. Luke was working a two part job one at a grocery store and one at a bank. Then Don told Luke to go to on Europe cattle boat,and Luke couldn't say no. It was an opportunity of a life time for him.

So some people's job now were to help those contries get back in shape, so 44 nations came together and formed a UNRRA. The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of animals that were shipped over sea, thats what Luke and Don sigend up for.

A lot of people may say this task is verry dangores and that nobody should do it. But if Luke and Don didn't help ou then a lot of people could die because they have no shelter or food. They helped by going to Greese with horses for all the people and food for them and the horses.

Luke had turned 18 by the time they got to Greece to help out, but turning 18 also meant that he could be drafted to war. By 1947 Luke had already made nine trips to help people out. Nine trips was the most any ""Seagoin Cowby"" has ever went before.

In this story I read there was a man named Luke and he became a ""Seagoing Cowboy"". Luke helped out so many people on his journey. It was important that people would help Luke out.

One of my first reasons is that you get to help countries recover animals and supplies and help their people. It was an extremely great honor to help the countries that were affected by World War II. It also opened up the world to me, it made me more aware of other countries and their needs. If you join then you would feel like a better person because you would know that you helped multiple countries recover from a giant war that affected many people.

Including helping countries, you get to sightsee and explore them as well. From what I saw, every country has many beautiful and wonderful places to explore and see. I've seen many places in different countries such as, a castle in Crete, the Panama Canal on my way to China, and I've even taken a gondola ride in Venice, Itay. I got to see these many places just by signing up in this program. That is another reason why you should participate in being a Seagoing Cowboy.

First, I knew the adventure the trips held would be great like when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I got to meet new people in the places we traveled to. I even learned of some new cultures. Every trip had something different or new about it. Also,on each journey the other volunteers I traveled with became some of my closest friends.

Next, I became a seagoing cowboy for the exploration. I experienced so many new places for example there's the excavated caslte in Crete or the Panama Canal on my way to China. On some nights the ocean seemed to be a black endless void, but on clear days it looked like a beautiful blue mass. I also saw great foriegn marvels that I never imagined being able to see in person.

Finally, I joined the program to help people. Not only was I taking care of the animals that would bring livestock back to the nations, but I was supplying them with food.

There's also a chance to have fun on board. When Luke went on return trips all the animals were unloaded. The crew was able to play games like table tennis, fencing, and boxing. They also read and whittled to pass the time.

I think other people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will give you some reasons to support my opion.

One reason is they are very caring, because World War II ended, and it is 1945 and many countries were messed up from the war. so 44 nations joined together to help it's called the UNRRA, the UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys. So they both were helping these countries. So that is a reason why you should join because they are caring. Another reason is they go across the world to help countries. So when you think about you can go on tours to some places across the world and go sight seeing, so that is pretty cool. Last reason is just doing the right thing it is a very caring and helpful program to help innocent people who were not in the war, that died and houses got damage. so it is a helpful thing to do and fun thing to join.

some details that support luke claims is in paragraph 5 it says that one of the boys in the smalltown said besides helping people he had time to see Europe and China so like luke said it's not only just helping people you have time to go on tours of places in some of these different countries that you never ever seen that place before and go on a tour of that place in that country. Another detail is in paragraph 8 it says that it is fun on board coming back because they played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments,and a few other games so joining will be fun because when you are on board or on the ship you can play games.

So that is all I have. I think people should really recommend participating in

Luke made nine trips and was brave to make that choice.

Luke then decided to take his traveling a whole new level especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Luke decided to play games on board like basball,volleyball,table tennis he was also fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. well being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger.

The Seagoing Cowboys program made me more aware of people's needs in other countries. When we had nothing to do we would waste time by playing games in empty holds where animals had been housed.

When I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program we helped baby cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas. We arrived August 14 when the Pacific war ended. Don and I headed for Greece with horses and hay and oats to feed them.

You should be apart of the program because it is fun to go on adventures and take care of the animals. Even if you don't like animals you get to have freetime and play games and visit places like China. When you unload the animals you can play tennis, boxing, reading, and whittiling. The program opened up the world for me.

When I took care of the animals they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Also you had to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats. Next then you had to clean the stalls out. When I worked at a farm for my aunt Katie, it prepared me for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I was greatful for the opportuniy to help the program.

You should join the program because you help people by bring the animals and you have fun at the same time.

When I joined the program in 1945 World War ll was over and the whole place was ruined (which wasn't very beautiful in my opinion). That is my introduction.

Luke said, ""I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime."" You can join this program, because it is just full of interesting sites, and places that you could go see and tour just like I did. ""The places that I toured was Europe and China"" ,says Luke. When Luke went to Europe which was 1945 World War ll was over and the place was left in ruins. You can also find super interesting and people that have fulfilling minds about all the places in Europe.

To support my claim Luke an some other cowboys had an amazing time on board (The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed) says Luke. He had more fun playing games then he did helping the animals. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United Statesand a month to get to China.

Participating in this oppertunity has many advantages maybe on what you'd like to be when you are a grown adult.

To begin with, the sights if you choose to join will be marvelously outstanding in the distance and upclose.

Once you get to Greece it's breath taking if you get to the part of Greece named Acropolis. There is also an excavated castle in Crete annd marveled at the Panama Canal as you head to the country of China.

Secondly,traveling the high seas when your on board on a boat it can be somewhat fun. The cowboys play baseball and a little of volleyball to keep their minds bussy. This also includes table tennis tournaments, fencing and boxing, reading, whittling, as for games had also helped the time pass by.

In addition, this opportunity shall make you more aware of your surroundings. For example, the people that have their needs but maybe they don't have food or water to drink and knowing you did something good makes you feel good about yourself. Not only in your country but in other countries and their troubles that you may not think about or outside of your state. Just thinking about how many people out there in the world no matter rich or not they all need our help at times.

The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service .

I am very grateful for this opportunity because it made me more aware of animals and people of other counties and their needs. This awareness stays with me leading me family to host a number of international visits for many year after. ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
A89EDCE829DA,"Why exactlly should one spend there time in the Seagoing Cowboy program? Being in the Seagoing Cowboy program is a progam you should participate in. Just think about the many horses and cows that are harmed and need our after help after a war. This experience is a great one and you should try it.

Traveling is a big part of this amazing program, you get to see so many many historic sites and arcitecture. Being able to cross the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean by boat is pretty cool. One of the times this was used was in 1945 after World War II ended in Europe. Also in 1945 the Seagoing Cowboys helped after the Pacific War had ended.

After world War II ended many countries were ruined to help fix this 44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). This is also a very good way to help in a fun way. The Seagoing Cowboy program saves many animals who would have else not made it through that deadly war or natural disaster. This is the program made for people who love animals. There are always cows or horses on board that are being rescued.

There is always work to be done as well. So, if your strong and like to work that could be a plus. Haybales and grain always need brought up from lower holds of the ship. Stalls always need cleaned and there is always work to be done. Sometimes you can catch a break on the way to another port and then you can relax.

So why should you join the Seagoing Cowboy program? Well for one reason, your helping so many animals and people too. There is always animals that need our help because well, animals can not talk for themselves so we have to be there for them. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
3F8C6F9EBDEB,"Hi my name is Luke Bomberberg and I want you to join my program because it is a nice thing to do for the sick people. It may take a long time to get there and back but hey its worth the wait to help the sick. You also get to explore new places around the world with me and my friend,it also gets you exercising because there is a lot of heavy things like the hay barrels. This programis also really really safe. annother thing is that there are about 335 horses, so if you are affraid of horses then this program isn't for you.

In 1945 we went to New Orleans to get started with our program on the SS Charles W. Wooster. I turned 18 when we finally made it to Greece wich meant that I could be drafted for military servrice. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I had made nine trips,the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. When I was a little boy,helping out on my aunt Katie's farm had prepared me for hard work,but not from the dangers at sea.

On my second trip I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour every night. One rainy night after making my hourly report to the captain I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal aalong the edge stopped my slide keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Antlantic.

I found time to have fun on board,especially                                                                                                                                                         ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
4B6C383004CA,"You all should join the Seagoing Cowboys group because in paragraph nine it says that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke, it opened up the world to him. Paragraph nine also states that Luke said ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys you would be sure to highly to enjoy it! Here are a few reasons about why you might reconsider your thoughts.

Luke was just an ordinary boy who was working two jobs. In paragraph one it states that Luke's friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Paragraph one also stated that Luke couldn't pass up the offer becasue it was an opportunity of a lifetime. In paragraph two it states that Luke and Don signed up to be apart of the Seagoing Cowboys. Because of Luke and Don signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys they got many opportunities to cross the seas.

Another reason why some of you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you could be a small-town boy or girl like Luke in paragraph five, and expirience many amazing opportunities if you just take the chance and say yes. If youn think that all you will do is stay on a boat and go somewhere and then leave, then get back on the boat and do the same thing you are wrong. In paragraph five Luke states ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" To a lot of people that is really cool because a lot of people woud love to vist China and Europe and have a great time.

Last but not least, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you would be surrounded with a ton of great people. In paragraph eight it states that Luke found time to have fun on board. It also states that the cowboys played baseball and volleyball games so it will be sure that you will have fun! But only if you join the Seagoing Cowboys because if you don't you will miss out on a lot of fun things other than just work. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is something you don't want to miss out on so you better come and sign up now!

That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is a very big opportunity of a lifetime, something some people wouldn't want to miss out on. The Seagoing Cowboys want you to join and they don't want you to think thatb you are just doing work they want you to also have fun! ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

F7CD45B0F896,"My names Luke and

I got invited to the Seagoing Cowboys Program by my friend Don Reist.

At the time i was working two part-time jobs. I knew that this was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime so obviously i accepted Don's invitation.

We got our first orders in August 1945 to report to new orleans.

We were smooth sailing from that point on.

As i was on the ships i learned a lot of valueable lessons.

Being on the Seagoing Cowboys program was such a blessing and it had quite a few perks.

We got to visit a lot of cool and different places around the world.

Not only did we get to visit them we also got to learn a few things about them.

Being on the Seagoing Cowboy progams is not just all fun and games it is also a lot or hardwork.

Feeding and taking care of the animals is real hardwork. In the article is says "" Caring for the animals in the crossings kept me busy.""

This was very true because the work kept you very tired.

All things have to come to a end though.

When we finally did drop off the animals and all thier food and supplies we got to have a little fun.

After the animals were unloaded us cowboys got to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds were the animlas were being housed. I think if your a hardworker your sure to do just fine in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you do go and become in the Seagoing Cowboys program a good peice of advice is to watch your step because some nights the ships tend to get a little slippery.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

If you love the water,and if you love the Ocean then you will love this program. we are on the water/Ocean 24/7. In August 1945, we recived orders to go to New Orleans. have you ever wanted to go to Europe? Now you can if you join this once in a lifetime opportunity. Trust me you wont regreat joining the program. I know I didn't regreat it. In the year 1947, i had made nine trips and i don't mean to brag about my self but nine trips is more than any other Sea Cowboy. if you join this program you could beat my nine trips. I was a little smal town boy but when i went on a adventure it was a great unbelievable opportunity. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. If you ever get board then just play a game like me and my friends did. Man we played all kinds of things. We played baseball,volleyball,table-tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is munch more than just adventures. you have to have responable and respectfull. One time i fell and brock my ribs. You have to be carefull.

There are many reasons .

Here are some of them.

One reason is you get to help people that have no food or shelter because of a war.

They lost everything you take them food and biuld them shelter.

Another reason is that you get to meet people from other countries and explore there culture.

You go to China and Greece that is so fun.

Lastley a reason is that you get to stop at cool towns and countrys to get a tour.

We went to Crete and we went to the Panama Canal and went on a tour of that as well.

There are so many fun and entertaining things to do when you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Some reasons that you should not become a Seagoing Cowboy is because it is very dangerous.

You go into other lands not knowing if they aer going to be mean or very nice to you new comers.

You have to feed dangerous and vises animals on the ship such as hourses, goats, and donkeys.

They may not be happy about being on the ship and may get mad and hurt you.

You could fall overborad and be left to yourself in the ocean.

The ship may fall over and you may have a ship wreak.

You are going to paces that are danaged from the war and the soliders there might not know that the war is over and they could shot you.

Even though there are many ways that you could get hurt or killed you will still have lots of fun on your trip across the world and back.

As you can see there are so many fun things to do on the ship and on the land.

You can play volleyball, baseball, wresteling, tag, hide and seek, and even vesing.

You will have fun on and off the ship and you will never be bored there are so many ways to be active and healthey even on the boat.

There are so many things to do off the ship like go and have a nice taste of what ever country or culture you are in, it is truly great.

Here are some reasons why youu should sign up. You could help people out by going and helping with the food supplies, horses, cattle, youn cows, mules,and more. It would be doing a good deade too.

Another good reason is it might be a opportunity that you may never get to take again or if you wanted to try it too see if you like it.

If you are 18 though you could be drafted for military service so if u ever wanted to be apart of the military service it would be a good idea to sign up. Another good reason is if you wanted to just go and look at some new places this would be a good idea because they travel a lot and make a lot of trips.

Going on trips like this to places that need help because they just got out of worl war ll can make you see how much more help thses people need then you do.

92E5CF25A5F4,"Luke is a boy signing up with his friend Don,here's some reason's why you should also sign up like Luke did himself. My first reason is you can help people while you travel like how Luke did when he went to europe to help people restock on supplies,food,and animals. You can also go because,while you're shipping animals across seas you can spend time with somepretty amazing animals. Another good one is you can go sightseeing while shipping or going on the land you shipped something to like how Luke did when he went to Europe. These are all great in my point of view because even its some hard work it can still be enjoyable because there is just so much to see like how I mentioned the animals before,and of course the sightslike ruins,structures,and much more. Another point of fun you could have while being a seagoing cowboy is after you shp the animals off of the boat or ship when the animals are gone it can clear up some room for you and any friends you may or may not have made. What I mean is after the animals are gone you can use the extra room for games,messing around,and even spending time with friends you may have made. THis is a good idea because even thogh its hard work and a little bit dangerous Luke stayed positive because of him stating ""The cattle boat trps were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy"" meaning he enjoyed being a seagoing cowboy. Now even though its still fun to be a seagoing cowboy there is still dangers. The ocean is a pretty dangerous place so it'll still be a hard job especially when it comes to storms. If a serious storm hits while on a boat trip it could still be pretty devastating someone could get knocked off and go into the ocean,one of the animals could fall off,and someone cold slide and break something when they have a hard fall. Even though its still pretty dangerous and pretty hard work for someone it can still be enjoyable Im not going to say the same stuff I already said earlier so Im just going to say that depending on how it goes and how you act about it it will be enjoyable just wait and see.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

But when your done taking care of the animals you can sit down and look at the astonishing night sky and the huge blue ocean. Playing with The animals would be so fun. There would be tasty cows beautyful horses, and stubern mules.

Also when your a Seagoing Cowboy other people would be binifit too! The common towns people, and the solders from the war. You would bring them cows for food, horses to ride, and mules to pull carts of goods. That would prevent people from starving. It would also help move reckage from the war.

Also you could help people from the war and solders. So why wouldn't you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy?                          ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

If you like helping others you should join. Thats basicly all we do. We as Seagoing cowboys ship or trans port animals to other countries in need. We partern up with UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) which by the way is an awesome team. That is one of the main reasons why I joined.

One other reason is that you get to see the marvels of the world. Like Greece. That place was sure amazing. You get so much extra time after you deliver the cattle.

Another reason is that all that free time my crew and I play games and such during our free time as well. That means that you bond together and have life-long friends that will always be there for you.

Intoduction

Luke had turned 18 before he arrived in Greece, he said"" I could be drafted for military services"" ( paragraph 4). It took Luke to get across the Atlantic Ocean eastern coast of the United States 2 weeks, and 1 month to get to China. Luke had made a least 9 trips, more than any Seagoing cowboy. By the time it was 1947 Luke had helped people he said "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China"" ( paragraph 5). Luke had visited Venice,Italy he rode a gondola because the streets were water. He also "" took a tour in a excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canalon his way to China"" (paragraph 5).

The First one he visited was Greece that was the place they headed first. Then it was Europe that was where the boat was headed toward. Venice it is last he said "" So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water.

Conclusion They are so manythings that Luke learned that ws really acurate of being a night watchman. Like helping people benefit of seeing Europe and China. Going through new expirence places like Europe, China, Veince,Italy. I am sure he probably visited more but, who knows. Luke learned that they'res a lot to handle of being a military watchman.

3AB8EF127A7A,"In the article Luke went on the Seagoing Cowboys program. In this program you go on a trip to other places, like China, and deliver animals and care for the animals while aboard. This would also help the people affected by World War ll. The trip was about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. There are a lot of different activites to keep the people on the ship busy.

Other people should participate in the program because in the article it says it could be a good opportunity to learn something new. It also may be fun taking care of the animals. While caring for these animals it may keep you busy. Luke said he liked the part of the trip after the animals were dropped off and maybe people might too. You can also play games, sports, or something like reading or wittling while aboard the ship. These activties were also said to help pass the time. Luke also said that besides helping the people, this can give you a benefit of seeing China and Europe. Another thing Luke said that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. Maybe you would think that too. This experience may also open up the world to you! Luke said that It made him more aware of the people of the other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with Luke. You would be greatful for this opportunity just like Luke if you attended this program. This trip may be fun to you and can give a new learning experience. It can also be life changing!

9F573DCA061F,"Have you ever read the story A Cowboy who rode the waves? I know I have, it's a book about a boy who is invited to Europe and he becomes a Seagoing Cowboy after World War 2. This book includes being a Seagoing Cowboy, the Seagoing Cowboy has to take care of animals on a ship and a boy named Luke explores

First, the Seagoing Cowboy, a Seagoing Cowboy is a Cowboy who takes care of animals over sea or on a boat. The Seagoing Cowboy in the story was no different he took go care of the animals. Everyday he watered and fed the animals 2 to 3 times a day. When Luke first became a Seagoing Cowboy he knew it was going to be alot of hard work so he worked as hard as he could. I can infer that if Luke had not took good care of any of the animals they all would be dead.

Next, Luke Bomberger explores, in the story,it states that Luke visited Europe, China and he explored the Atlantic ocean. and also the text states that Luke also found time to have fun aboard the ship, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. I can infer that if I was a Seagoing Cowboy I would not survive working as hard as Luke did.

Last, Being a Seagoing Cowboy,by reading the text,being a Seagoing Cowboy is alot of work. In the text it says being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened the world to him. And in Luke's own words he said It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs. Also being a Seagoing Cowboy can be dangerous because when Luke was night watchman on a rainy night, he slipped on a ladder and cracked his ribs but thankfully he didn't fall in the Atlantic ocean because their was a small strip of metal along the edge of his side. I can infer that if that small metal strip was not there Luke would most likely be dead.

First i think it is a fun oppratuinity to try. How often do you get offard this or even hear about it. Just like they said in the strory he couldn't say no because it was an opportunity of a life time. They said he traveled all around the world. I think that would be awesome and fun to try.

Next i think it would be fun to be around all of those animals. I understand that some people don't care about animals or anything that i have to say. I know some people get sea sick or are afraid of boats or sailing. I think that holds you back to much in life to have a fear like that. I think people should get out and try something new.

Last i think that it would be fun and exciting to travel around the world. To see all the sights and accient things. Even thought you have to be a ceartian age to do some stuff,well some stuff you don't need to be a ceartian age. I guess it depends on your udea of fun. But to say you have been there to something you see on TV or in the paper, would be cool when most of the people you know haven't.

Those are my reasons why i think it would be a fun thing to try. You get to see the sights and the animals. I hope more people take into consideration of trying something new most of the time.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it gives you a lot of opportunities to see different places.

You can go visit some of the most exciting places in the world.

Also if you like animals it gives an opportunity to take care of them.

If you have never gone over seas then there is your opportunity. You travel all over the world, go over the seas, and oceans. You get to adventure the seas, oceans, and the world. Also if you are a young Seagoing Cowboy and you still need to attend school the you can learn about the countries and seas by exploring them.

Like I said earlier if you still need to attend school you can learn different languages because you are exploring the world. So by learning diffenrent languages it can open up many opportunities for you. But it doesn't need to be all about learning. You can play games on the way and see many different sites that's the whole world would want to see. Then when you come back you can tell all your friends about the trips you have had. Then maybe they would like to come along with us.

In conclusion that is why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy to have those many adventures. ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

When Luke and Don were traveling over seas in the Seagoing Cowboys,They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, Headed for Greece. The cargo was 335 horses and enough oats to feed all the horses.

Before arrivingt in Greece,Luke turned 18, Which back then meant that Luke could be drafted for military service.

A couple years later he was discharged,Luke had made nine trips,The most of any Seagoing Cowboy ever. The cattle boat trips were an unbelieveable experience for Luke being a small town boy. Before helping anyone he had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But Luke also got to see the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice,Itlay.

Luke also toured at the evacuated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern United States and a month to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to eat and give the animals water three times a day. Bales of hay and oats had to be pulled from the lower ship. The stalls had to be cleaned.",1,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
F2F752BC22F9,"I had so much fun being in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I would tell anyone to try it, and I am going to tell you why it is such a great thing to do.

First, you get to help others in need. It was felt amazing being able to help those who were hurt in the war. I also got to visit beautiful Europe and China. It was unbelieveable too seing the Acropolis in Greece. Taking a gondola ride over wonderful Venice, Italy was breathtaking. I also had a tour through a castle, how great is that? I was also marveled by the Panama Canal on my way to China.

If you enjoy animals, you'd love this job. While on the two week trip crossing the Atlantic, the animals kept me very busy. I got to feed and give water to them about two or three times a day. But, stalls had to be cleaned.

It was always fun on board, especially on return trips because I got to play baseball and volleyball, which were held in the empty animal holds. We did many other activities, like table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games.

Mainly, this experience made me more aware of people of other countries. This awareness even lead to my family generously hosting some international exchange students.

The Seagoing Cowboys is an amazing program. There a many reasons why I believe this, and I tried to list most of them. If you do not try this fun, great, wonderful thing, then you're missing out.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

To Whom It May Concern,

Have you ever met someone who is or was a seagoing cowboy? Well, if your awnser is no then it's all about to change. Hi my name is Luke, and I am a seagoing cowboy. I really want to encorage other's to become seagoing cowboys because we need more people to complete the jobs. So come on out and serve your country with the seagoing cowboys!

First of all, I have multiple reasons why should join us. Like its a lot of fun. Ok, so you didn't hear this from me but some times after we drop the cattle off we like to go into the empty stalls and play games like tennis and volley ball. Due to that this job really dosen't feel like a job at all. If you like to have fun and take care of animals then a seagoing cowboy is the right job for you. Also, this is a once in a lifetime chance. When I was offered this deal I jumped on it immediantly because I knew that if I didn't that I would never get another chance like this again. Plus, you probally wont have to join the military. For me this counted as my service.

Futhermore, we do many things in this program such as take care of animals. I get to go down everyday to feed them and I always am able to pet and play with them. As I said before we also play many games to keep us entertained because we have alot of time on our hands. So everyday is like another mini party. As you probally know we have to drive a huge boat filled with animals across the ocean. So we alternate drivers. We always want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to have fun and sleep. But, even though were making amazing memoriess all of us need to do are fair share of the work .

Finally, I have many memories of my own to share. Starting with I made a record by heading out on a cattle trip 9 times! Maybe you could also set a record? I know that I have made it pretty clear that I have had fun. But I have also gotten my share of bumps and bruises over the years. Beside that is no match to the pain I felt before this job. Here I feel safe and in my old life I didn't. I was working 2 part time jobs. One at a grocery store and one at a bank. Plus I didnt get very good py and I wasn't happy. But now I am. Everyday is amazing thanks to my job that is so great that it dosen't even feel like one.

So in conclusion I love my job! I think that you should try it out. If it dosen't sound appealing to you then just give it a spin. I really do belive that you will like it as much as I did. Maybe you can set a new world recored! Or maybe just a pearsonal one. But which ever record you want to set or what job you pick, just pick the one that makes you happy. Dont go out and do somthing boring like I did at first. Just find what you love and do it. You only live one life one time. So why not live it to the fullest?

Best Wishes,

Luke!",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

But also there is a good and a bad thing about this program i already told you the good things now it's time for the bad stuff well when you go on the adventure it's going to take you abundance of days to get where you need to be. Do you want to know why it takes you a long time ? Thats because you are going to be riding on a ship yes thats right a ship .Now thats going to take you forever to get where you need to be .

Well seagoing cowboys program is a good way to start off because you're doing things for yourself and your helping other animals to so thats a really good idea you should think about today . and i almost forgot you have to be an hard worker to be in this program so that is my amazing ways why you should be in this great opprotunity .

61591A4CF55A,"I am Luke and I am a Seagoing Cowboy. If you ever get a chance to be a Seagoing Cowboy you better take the job because their is a lot of cool things you can see.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a very unique thing to do. You can go to different Countries and see very fragile things. When I was on my way to China I toured an excavated castle in Crete. Then I had marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are so many things you can do and see.

The Seagoing cowboy is also special because you can spend time with nature on the sea. I had went to many differnt places and had fun spending time with the animals. I get to feed them oats and give them water and some other things snd you get to clean out there pins. Then the animals will keep you busy and that is why I like it.

Another thing I did was taking night time watch. Watching the animals at night is very cool and every hour you get too go up and tell the captain what is going on. But on the rainy nights you have to be careful. One night I was walking down the steps and slipped and about fell into the dark ocean. That night I knew I had to be more careful.

There are alot of things you can witness as a Seagoing Cowboy. Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of unique Oppertunities and if you get the chance to be one you better take the job and you will witness cool places.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
72F91949F0C2,"You should Participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to see and experience sites that not everyone gets to see, like Acropiles in Greece, tour a castle in Crete, and be marvled at the Panama Canal as you head to China, and you get to see even more there! The Segoing Cowboys program is a program that takes food and animals to China and Eroupe after World War Two.

After you take the food and animals to China and Eroupe, you get to have fun on your way back to America. You could play baceball and volleyball in the empty holds were they kept the animals, or you have

Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and that passes the time on that long time back home.

Just be Carefull you do not wan't to go over board into the merky depths of the cold Antlantic Ocean. Also, you don't want tho slide down the ladder of the ship, you won't go over, you would just break a few ribs and not be able to care for the animals.

That is why I think you should join the seagoing cowboys program, and all in all, it is a good time!",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
