03B7C27AB860,"I say we keep the Electoral College. For one we are not put with that pressure of a single vote from us, the people instead its like a claim to the candidate. Though some candidates in some states may seem hopeless to the people of the states though that barley happens due having a trans-regional appeal. Even if it is a bit ""outdated"" we have been using it for years and it hasn't had much flaws. The close vote in 2012 was won because of the votes in Florida due to its population thanks to the Electoral College. Also some people may not understand the real intents of a president, example if a potental candadate, if in their campaign the went to sent troops to war but try to cover it up by saying the area they are sending the troops in caused something or threatened the country the  then the people would side with the candidate.

It balances  out large states from small states not causing much of a arguement so you have equality. Also it depends on the state candidate who should be listen to the people of the state to help their vote. Also some people can be bias to a potental candidate and vote for him instead but with the state candidate that can't really happen. Even if the state candidate is hopeless they can still try to the the popular vote for that candidate their voting for. With those small votes they could make that candidate win. If states pay attention to candidate ads they could vote for the candidate they actually think should win for political reasons. For area the candidate know he will win he has focus on just those states so he points them out making the other states feel like that candidate doesn't care for them. Say we remove the Electoral College then people in more populated area can vote for the candidate the wish to win and they can outnumber the candidate by a whole lot.

Bottom line we need to keep the electral college.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
0D11CD49499E,"Hello Senator of the state,

I think we should change the Electoral College to the election by popular vote because whats really the point in having people vote for president if it doesn't contribute hardly any to which person gets elected?

The Electoral College in highly unfair to voters simply because of the winner-take-all system. Voters vote for a slate of electors to choose instead of the president him/herself. Although the electors could be anyone not holding public office. Sometimes State Convetions, State Party's Central Committee, and sometimes the Presidential Candidate's themselves choose the electors. Which also is not fair because they could choose a party who favors them and their party to win, or help the president win the election. In

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong mentions ""The single best argument against the Electoral College is what we might call the 'Disaster Factor.' ... Back in 1960, segregationist in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy) Perhaps not worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, in that case the State Delegate would vote on the president and the senate would choose the vice-president.

But on the flip side there are ""five reasons for retaining the Electoral College regardless of it's lack of domocratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""

Certainty Of Outcome

- a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.

Everyone is President

- a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states because he wouldn't gain electoral votes in states he already won over, so he went to other regions to try to win them over to gain more electoral votes.

Swing States

- the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates.

Big States

- other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

Avoid Run-Off Elections

- the Electoral College avoids problems of elections in which no candidiate receives a majority of the votes cast.

It can be argued that the Electoral College is the better route to go but it could cause voters to turn away on voting for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, and knwoing their vote will have no affect they will have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.

I think that we should get ride of the elecoral college because its not what people want. The popular votes lets you pick which president you want. The electoral college is when you pick your candidate but your picking a elector and they bring in the votes. The people that vote should be able to pick who they want and then yea. So we should have popular votes then keeping the electoral college. So we need a popular vote and not a electoral college where you dont actually vote, you vote for a elector and then you tell them which candidate you vote for and then they bring in the votes. For exaple, if i would to say that the candiadates are George washington and john kerry and i pick george and 34 others pick him the elector would bring 35 votes to the congress and then he would have 35 votes.

The electoral college is not a fair way for citizens to vote in the untied states. the popular vote system would work at so much more better for citizen. It would give them more of a say in the vote and more people would vote

First reason I think popular vote is better than electoral college is because it gives citizen more of a say in what goes on in the voting process. the reason for this if the popular vote was the system they used you will be voting on a actual president. not voting for someone to pick your president for you. so this clearly shows that voting using the popular voting syste gives people more of a say in the voting process. yes it might be unfair to smaller states who have less people but still.

Second reason i picked this thing was because well more people would vote. the reason more peole would vote is because they will feel theyhave more of a say in things. for instance if someone told you you can have more freedom or none you will pick freedom. so clearly this shows that more people would vote if they we used the popular vote system instead of the other one. yes the other one still lets you vote but not for a president

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

1755C563AFB2,"For many years people have been debating whether or not to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. According to source 1, the electoral college was established as ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" There are few positive effects of the Electoral College, however, there are many negative effects. I am in favor of changing the United States' election process to election by popular vote because there are many risks with the Electoral College, the Electoral College is outdated, and lastly, the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many states.

Currently, while using the Electoral College, the United States takes multiple risks. Some of the major risks were stated in source two. One of the major risks included, what of the elector put the vote in for the candidate he wished? Of course no matter what the situation, there will be risks to take. However, when those risks become actions, and happen more than once, people put up a guard and start to question whether or not the process is trustworthy. A sentence in source three declared, ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed). Americans are expected to trust a slate of electors whom we know little about personally, and trust is a personal thing. Trust is something that has to be earned. Therefore, when our trust is betrayed more than once because of the process the Electoral College, there is no way to earn that trust back once again. Without the Electoral College, this would not be an issue.

Not only is the Electoral College risky, but it is also outdated. The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers, over a century ago. With new technology, and new systems forming, the election process should be more modern. Also, when it was decided to use the Electoral College, there were fewer people in the United States. Currently, in modern day, the population is much greater. A country with a greater population needs a modern election selection.

The Electoral College is very unfair to states that do not have the ability to make an impact in the election. If the election process were changed to elected by popular vote, smaller states would have the ability to make their vote matter.

The Electoral College needs to be changed immediately in able for citizens to stop worrying about taking major risks, so our country as more of a modern election process, and so every vote counts. Changing to election by popualr vote could make the United States a better country.                         ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
2865585E0E34,"I am writing a letter to my state senator in which i'm arguing if i'm in favor of keeping the Electoral College or Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United states. I'm in favor of the election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For instance if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry, they would go to Congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Also its Unfair to the voters because of the winner-takes-all system. In each state candidates dont spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing""  states. In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. In defense ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates, to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states."" Ok but the winner-take-all system is still focusing on the ststes knowing that there going to vote for you, and notthe other states that possibly will or will not vote for you.

Another reason is that the Electoral college is just a disaster factor simple as that. In the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually gone to Kennedy. Also what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? It happened in Hawii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who presided over the senate validated only his opponents electors making sure to do so ' without establishing a precedent.

In conclusion the Electoral college is unfair, irrational, and just a hotmess. Like Bob Dole said ""Abolish the Electoral College'.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
2C8521890B5A,"Dear Mr or Ms Senator,

Presient Richard Nixon, and President Bill Clinton both have something in common; they won their presidencies with the Electoral College, not the popular vote. (According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Paragraph 22) Richard and Bill only won 43% of the popular vote against their opponents while they were running for office. This is why the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of switching to the popular vote for the elections.

Now you're probably wondering, does high school students even know what the Electoral College is and what it's job? Yes, high school students do know what the Electoral College is and what it does. The Electoral College is made up of 538 electors. Your state amount equals one member from the House of Represenatives and two from the Senate. The electors are chosen from the candidate's political party. The Electoral College decides the president and vice president every four years every Tuesday ater the first Monday in the month of November.

Mr or Ms Senator, the Electoral College needs to stay instead of the popular vote because when you have the Electoral College you will get an outcome from it unlike the popular vote. Almost all states have the ""winners take all"" method which according to ""What is te Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Regisiter (Paragraph 7) this method is when all electors are awarded to the presidental candidate that is winning. Also the popular vote overrides the popular vote. In ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner (Pararaph 18) the 2012 presidental campaign for example it was the battle between Mitt Romney who is a Republican against Barack Obama who is a Democrat. Obama received only 51.3 percent of the popular vote and Obama got 61.7 percent of the Electoral College. As you can see the Electoral College overrided the popular vote which ultimately made him president. Also in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden"" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States.

To continue on, the Electoral College should stay instead of the popular vote since one region of the United States doesn't have enough power of the Electoral Votes to make a presidental candidate win. Look at ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Mitt Romney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can ""swing"" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen.

On the other hand, according to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" (Parargraph 14) the Electoral is outdated, irrational, and unfair. In ""The Inefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer key names such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerece all want to get rid of the Electoral College and use the Popular Vote. Look at the presidency that was in 2000 with Al Gore against George W. Bush. Al Gore would have won the election if the election was based on the popular vote. He won the popular vote with over 60%! But unfortunately, he didn't win and lost to George W. Bush since Bush won the Electoral College votes. But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the ""winners take all method"" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.

Ultimately, Mr or Ms Senator, the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can't overpower another and make a candidate win the presidental campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people.

4B6A52E23DE9,"The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candited. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this coutry and make america a place of oppurtunity. The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the "" winners it take all"" rule.

We as american people cannot choose their own goverment, as it says in source two, that when voters vote they are voting for the canditates electors. Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.

In source two it says that electorals who have been select by the state can choose their opposing candidtade, which is more disatvantgeing to the american people and america's future.  for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.

In source two and three it states the rule "" winner take it all"" . The votes the other lose the,  winning can take it all, that vote that they take from the losing does not count Because the people really didnt mean to vote for the candidate they don't want or the candidate they dont support, its like your money fell on the floor and someone just took it knowing its yours.

In conclusion,  the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.

If a method like this has worked thid long i think we should keep it until it doesnt work. Then when it stops working we could start a new type of election.

F64457891D40,"Dear, State Senator

I have come to a conclusion that keeping the Eletoral College would be a much better process instead of an unorganized popular vote. The electoral college is a great process with the votes in congress and a vote of the qualified cictizens. It is more organized with five benifits of certainity of outcome, trans- regonal appeal, winner-take-all method, big states, and avoiding run-off elections. These benifits help the elections go more smoothly. The Electoral College process has a selection of electors that vote for president and vice president, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.

"" The dispute over outcome of an electoral college is possible if it happened in 2000 but is less likley than a dispute over the popular vote"". ""For example, Obama got sixty-one point seven percent of the electoral vote to only fofty-one point three percentof popular votes cast frm him and Romney... ""

So the reason for a less likley dispute over a popular vote is because of the winning candidates share of the electoral college. Basically and eletoral vote can be tied by the total number of votes. Even fivehundred thirtyeight is an even number and also unlikely.

""The electoral college requires for a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal.""

None of the regions have enouough electoral votes to elect a president. So, a regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,  and also gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows he will win in only. It results to just regional apeal and is unlikely going to be a successful president. The residents of other regionds are most likley going to feel like there votes do not count, the new president will have no regards for there intersts, and he is not realy their president.

"" The winner- take-all methode of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states.""

The toss-states mostly pay more attention to the campaign and listen to the competitors and they know thay are going to decide the election. They are the most thoughtful voters and they have the most informationand attention. These states should be the ones to decide the election.

Big states get some of the weight restored in political balance by population and lose by virtue of mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes.""

The electoral college also aviods problems of eletions, which no candidate will recieve the majority of votes.

""There is a pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins the majority of the votes cast...""

Pressure can greatly complicate presidential election precess, it is avoided to produce a clear winner. Keep the Electoral college for all of these benifits that make the election process easier for electors and candidates the t chose the electors.

A0755DDC0778,"Many people agree in abolishing the Electoral College. Electoral Collage caused a dispute in the year 2000. The Electoral College is a irrational system and it should be banned.

Certainly the Electoral College has some benefits. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our sidpised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner the author states that the Electoral College ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of votes cast."" With the Electoral College there is no issue of a candidate getting the most votes, so there wont have to be any run-off elections. Run-off elections complicated the election process. Posner asserts that the ""winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It is because of this that the possibility of an argument over the outcome of an Electoral College is lesser then an argument over the popular vote. Although this is true, the people should have the say on who their president will be. The Electoral College is a broken voting system that causes confusion and dispute. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be used as a way of voting for America's President.

A key issue is that the candidate with the most popular vote does not have the certainty of winning. This is a problem because America can not have the leader she wants and deserves. Bradford Plumer from the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" argues that the Electoral College causes "" the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency."" If the people can not chose who they want as their leader then where is their freedom? Plumer also states that  the voters can not always ""control whom their electors vote for,"" We dont get to chose who the electors are voting for. This way the value of the people's opinion is being diminished into nothing. The resonable solution to this problem is to just end the Electoral College imidiatly.

Another factor is that the electors have to much power over the election. Palmer writes ""that the electors could always defy the will of the people,"" The electors are the only people who have decent amount of power to chose a president. The people should have that kind of power. The author asserts that the electors "" have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,"" The electors are able to just change their mind when wver they like. The popular vote must decide on who should win. The future of america should depend only on the will of the people. The people has to finally stand up and fight for their right to chose their own President.

In final consideration, the Electoral College is unfair to the American people. We should have freedom to chose whom our country's leader should be. The popular vote should stay and the Electoral College should be banned once and for all.                                                    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

If a tie occurs the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million voters. Because of many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, The House's selection can hardly reflect the will of the people. For exapmple a tie would have occured in 1976 if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii had voted the other way.

The electoral college can be unfair to voters because the winner-take-all syntem in each state, candidates fon't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning. For example during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The elctoral college can have many good things but it still is not good enough for us to keep it.

It lets us choose and go home so that were not goin out all day waiting for so many people to do the majority now its all online which makes it even easier to tally it all up and see who gets the vote.

The Electoral College is just making everything alought easier for us and we are able to spend less time in a voting area waiting for people to get done. The online voting helps out alought because we are able to get everything done a whole lot easier then others.

Vote should be popular, the will of the people of the nation, though through the Electoral College, the people is denied.

Voting is, as far as common sense goes, the majority rule. The Electoral College voting system was established during the creation of the Constitution in order to secure a ""qualified vote""- an effort to diminish the will of the lesser, or unknowing. Arguably, it is stated that, ""..the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", or in other words the statement can easily be translated to ""we do not wish a nation of idiotic voters to decide our president"", each individual of the nation is mindful of others and care enough to express their opinion, as it is known a is a citizens duty to vote. A duty that must be followed. In any effort to simplify this, a voter is a voter. They are all ""qualified"". If a person cares enough about their nation to cast a ballot, without requirment, they certainly are qualified.

Now that the qualifications are established, the electors within the Electoral College are free to do as they wish. Waving a magic wand, the support of others is unimportant now, and they pull whatever they desire out of the hat, as written by Bradford Plumer, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsiblefor picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". What happened to majority rule? People should have the direct vote of presidential candidate, however we are faced with shocking facts such as the house selection rarely dispalying the correct majority rule, ""The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"".

The dispicable system was established long ago for an extremely specific purpose with specific issues, which is no longer the case today. In the United States, we are not a democracy. We are a Republic. Ridiculusly, voters do not control the election in our Republic, as shared,""...over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election"". Can those expect change? Ironically, no. The system would most like not allow that, and those mindful citizens would need to hope for a glance at serendipity.                              ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FEF2E1612F55,"Dear senator,

What are the chances in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states? Does the Electoral College work?

First of all, What is the electoral college? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the selectors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president,and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

What's wrong with the electoral college? Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all systemin each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing""states. It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best  arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elactions are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
816AFFBD5F3C,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has been an election process in the united states sense the constitution was created. But it has come to the time where it no longer has a valuble position and is beginning to deteriorate. Over 60% of voters would prefer to only have a popular vote for Presidential elections, rather than the Electoral College. Recently it seems as if every election has been very tight and the winner of the popular votes loses due to the turn out of the Elecoral College votes. The Ellectoral College system should be abolished and banned from our election process.

In the Electoral College voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President rather than them directly voting themselves. Source 2 States ""The Electors can be anyone not holding office."" Therefore anybody can put theirself in the position to be in the Ellectoral College, even if they are unqualified for the responsibilities it requires. Also voters can't always control who their electors vote for so the efficiency of the election has already decreased.

This system allows for disaster. The electors could always defy the will of the people. Source 2 brings up ""Segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic elecors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" ""Faithless"" electors in the past have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they would like, and there is no guarentee that this will not occur again.

When it comes down to the core, the Electoral College does not provide an equal election to all voters. You will not find candidates dedicating their time in states where they believe they do not have a chance of winning. In effect, the representation and campaigning is not equally distributed throughout all the states. Some states may get no campaigning at all. Source 2 includes ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen staes didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" All the focus is centered into the tight races of the ""swing"" states.

It is said that rarely will the electoral college voting come out as a tie but it has happend. In the situation of a tie the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, and the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

The Electoral College is out dated and irrelevant to our modern society and it is too indirect to present the true votes from our country. It is time to leave the vote to the people and only the people, and it is time for our country to mature and abolish the Ellectoral College.            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1EF5AB00CBCB,"I was once asked to write a letter about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote. My Opinion is that they need to change Electoral College. The three reasons why they should keep it is because, its not fair,it dosen't waste a lot of time,the electoral votes given to each state.

To Begin with, Electoral Voting seems very easy. Electoral College consists of 538 electors. They need a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the prsident. But their a lot of things wrong with the electoral college too. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. And voters vote not for the president,but for the slate of electors, who select the president. The Electoral college is unfair to voters. Becasue of the winner take all system, the candidates dont spend much time in the states they know they dont have a chance of winning. This is one of the reasons why they should change Electoral college.

To Briefly Continue, The Electoral College isn't a good system to use in my opinion. But the System dosent waste a lot of time. This is probaly the only reason they still use it today. All they do is go state by state seeing the candidates group of electors  votes. This process takes about 3 to 4 Hours to see what candidate won to be the president of the United States Of America. The President election is held every 4 years, on the tuesday after the first monday in November. But this is another reason why the Electoral collge system needs to be changed to popular vote.

Last But Not Least, The electoral votes given to each state sucks. Its not fair Texas gets 38 electoral but New York only gets 3. Way more people live in New york Than Texas. If they used election by popular vote everyone has the choice to pick which candidate they want to be president. And The elctoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism. Its hard for a democratic to win it. The Electors that elect for president not the people. This is another why this needs to be change.

To brieflty conclude, the system needs to be changed. its not fair to have and electoral voting system. the people dont get to vote for the candidate they want to win. These are some of the reasons why the system needs to be changed.                                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E84C9B67DFC8,"I believe that disbanding electoral college would be in favor of most peoples decisions. This way everyone has a chance to vote decisively and not having electoral college decide who should be the president of the united states. Electoral college dosent let the people decide who they want to be president. It lets the lets the slate of electors decide which is totally un fair in my decision. People are the ones who elect which president they feel will make the United States a better country. Maby the slate of electors have a different decision in mind than what the people of america think about who should be president.

Popular vote would be much better in my decision because it gives everyone a chance on picking there president and not having other people pick it for them. Say there was a tie in the electoral votes, than they would be passed onto the house or reps were state  delegations vote on the president and not the people of america. There is a greater quantity of people than there are slate of electors and house of representitves. The electoral college is completely unfair to voters because in each state candidates dont spend time in states they dont think will help them win presidency. We the people dont have the ability to choose who we want as a president and we want our freedom of being able to do that. There will be less conflicts and anger from the people if they disband electoral college.

But in many eyes electoral college are in favor to those people. They think its right to have the slate of electors vote for who they think would be a better president. The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. But it could lead to more pressure in the election process, which could greately complicate the presidential elections. There for saying that electoral college isint a good decision to have. People should decide what they want to have for this country. They should be able to take a mark and say we dont want electoral college anymore for the United States.

It would have to be weighted in an election of the people to decide what they want to have. Electoral college method of selecting a president may have a big impact on people by not choosing the president they want. Saying in the peoples minds that Electoral College should be disbanded and gotten rid of because it depends on what the people of the U.S. choose, not the slate of electors. We the people of the United States should have the freedom to choose what will make this  a better and stronger Country!      ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
A0F853DB728E,"Let the people vote! They know what they want, so let them have a say. Let them have what they want. The state senator should change the voting system to popular vote, because you're giving the American people what they want, it gets more people to participate and vote, and it lessens conflict.

To start, the senator should change the voting system to popular vote, because it gives the people what they want. If we rely on the Electoral College to elect our congress, presidents, senators, or whatever then what are the people voting for? People vote for who they want, so wouldn't make sense to elect the canidate with the most votes, since thats what the people want. Say there were two students running for class president, PROPER_NAME and PROPER_NAME. PROPER_NAME got 75% of the students votes while PROPER_NAME only got 25% of the students votes. In the end PROPER_NAME wins the election, because a group of teachers voted she should be president. Thats how the electoral college acts, like their vote counts more then the peoples.

To add on, they should change the voting system to popular vote, because it gets more people to participate and vote. Many people are not going to waist their time and vote for the canidate they want, when most likely that canidate will not even get elected. This will effect the whole process, if there is a decrease in people voting. To encourage people to vote give them hope that the canidate they vote for will have a shot at winning the election. They should not have to think my vote does not matter. They should feel like they actually have a say in the election.

Lastly, changing the voting system to a poplular vote can lessen conflict. When people see that who they are voting has a great chance at winning, but does not get elected, lets just say there can be outbursts. People usually start to protest in what they believe is fair. To decrease insidents like this give the people a fair vote and fair election. The people should come together and fairly vote on the canidate they want to be elected. For the benefit of the American citizens, let them know they have a voice in the elections, do not take their freedom of speech away from them; give them what they want. Yes we can vote!

To conclude the voting system needs to be changed to popular vote, because it gives the people what they want, it will get more people to participate and vote, and lastly it lowers conflict.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
58A71804C090,"Dear, State Senator I would for you to change the way presidents get elected to the United States of America. The reason for this is becuase, it would be much easier for the president, it would be easier on the states who have racial problems, and states who might cheat.

To back up my arguement, It would be much easier to abolish the electoral college. If the college was to be abolished then presidents themselves would be easily elected. Instead of electing 34 democratic electors. It would be fair to do that so that everything goes smoothly and better for everyone especially for presidents.

Next, it would go easier on states who have a bit of a racial issues. On some states it is diffcult to get elected because of racial issues. For instance, in Arizona there is a huge racial problem there and it would be difficult to elect different types of democractic electors. Thus making it difficult for Arizona to elect a president. In other staes it would also be the samething, just voting for the president would be easier.

My last reason, to abolish the electoral college is because of some states who might cheat. During election it is a diffiucult time because of every state wanting their president to one. That mabe the state would cheat the votes into elect those 34 democratic electors that will do anything to cheat. Another example, is in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose popular John F. Kennedy.

In Conclusion, the Electoral college needs to be abolish because it would be easier to vote for presidents, also it would be easier for states who have racial issues, and for states who are unfaithful.                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
0F954459ADB1,"To whom it may concern,

The growing debate on whether or not the electorial college is necessary for when the country is voting for it's president. I am writing to argue that the electorial college is vitial to the presidential election process becuase it evens out the importance of all the states' votes, gives us a certainty of an outcome, and allows for toss-up states to vote for the best candiate.(Posner) It can be precieved that the electorial college is a non-democratic way of voting for the president. Although it may be seen like that, it is in fact favorable towards the people becuase the electors that you indirectly vote for are voting for the same candidate as you were. The electorial college has been around for decaades and has very few times caused a disruption in our country. Why should we eliminate a process that has worked for years and will continue to work for years to come?

The electorial college should be kept becuase it allows for the smaller states to compete against the larger states in terms of votes for the presidency. A state like California has a larger population than Alaska so in turn they would have more voters. The electorial college evens out the number of people per state that votes so the candidiate chosen is truly who the country wants as the president. A larger state would also get more attention than a smaller state due to it's size difference. Smaller states would get discouraged and soo only the larger and more populated areas would vote becuase they are getting the most attention from the candidates themselves.(Posner) Our country is made up of fifty states and all of them should have an equal imput in who runs our counrty.

Many of the time voters will vote becuase they want to have their party in the president's seat. There are some states that are called swing states that will vote for the president that they beileve will have the best impact on our country reguardless of thei party preference. The electorial college lets the voters from these toss up states vote for the best candidate becuase they are more likely to make thought out decisions because they listen to the candidates proposal and not their party.(Posner) With this in mind, that means that in the end the president chosen is thought to be truly the best winner for the presidency because the toss-up staes chose them over the other.

A dispute is possible when the outcome of the president's election is presented. However, it is likely that a dispute will happen if popular vote were to be the process of electing our president. There is very little chances that the electorial college will have a tie and there is the realisation that if popular voting were to happen, there would be more tied elections happenning. The country wants to have certainty when voting for their president and having the electorial college allows for every state to have a definite candidate and in turn the country can have a definite president by the end of the elections.

The electorial college is vitial when chosing the presdient becuase it gives us certainty in an outcome, evens out the importance of states votes, and gives swinger states an equal vote as well. We need to keep the electorial college and should it be eliminated, it could put our presidential elections at risk. For decades, the electorial college has worked and our founding fathers believed it was necessary. I implore to you thatkeeping the electorial college is the best for the president's elections.

They get to vote who is going to be but, the Electoral College is consists of the selection of five hundred thirty eight electors. The majority of two hundred seventhy electoral votes is requied to elect the president. I think that is not going to be alot of votes of people who is voting for the person who they want. Is just voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Not always the voters can control whom their electors vote for!

The argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky, because the two thousand fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. They was lucky that happen , consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Perhaps the most worrying thin is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

The electoral college is unfair,outdated, and irrational. The arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality, and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.

These five reasons have something to deal with Electoral College. Is just some arguments that they have of electoral college, in of defense of the electoral college.

Is just asking if the electoral college works? I think that it doesn't because they have arguments about it ,about they dont get that much votes.

It can be a argued that the electoral college method of selecting the presisdent may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying thier state.

I strongly believe that the electoral college is the right way to go. The reason I feel this way is because of the electors, our founding fathers and, political parties.

I like that three electors is representing a state. I believe that the electors know more about the government than regular people. I want someone that knows what they are doing when they go to represent our state! There are 538 electors that vote for president and vice president but there only has to be 270 votes required to elect the president or vice president. Congress has to count the votes in the same place that the electors voted in. Sometimes I don't agree with the president that they picked but I'm glad that honest people count the votes. When the votes are finished and the winner's name is called out the losers revive a certificate of ascertainment.

Also a big part of me wants to keep the electoral college is because of our founding fathers. They put in so much work to help us. I would hate for all there hard work to go to waste. Also they had to put their lives on the line to help crate it. They broke so many laws  for us! Also think about not only did they put their lives in danger but their families life at risk! To me that took a strong amount of courage! I'm honored to talk about our founding farther any time! In the 23 amendment our founding fathers wrote the district of Columbia is allowed three electors and for them to be treated like a state! Also our founding fathers wrote that only citizens that are qualified to vote! Key word here people ''Qualified!'' As long as everyone remembers that key word then, we all should be fine!

I know! I know! A lot of people hate political parties but, I like them. Just think about when you were in school and you wanted to be class president so bad. The people who voted for you is like your political party. I know I loved my political party because they helped me win! Your political party helps come up with all kinds of cool ideas to get people to vote for you. Like when I was running for class president my political party baked cookies, passed out fliers and, help me wright my speech! That's just like when you run for president and vice president. Except I don't think they really pass out cookies when you run to be the real deal president! I know I would vote for the president if he or she gave me a cookie! Ha ha ha ha I crack myself up but it's the truth! Hint Hint for the next election I better be at the top of the list if someone decides to give out cookies!

I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME, and in my opinion we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United Stastes. Thats my opinon because you would know excacly how many people actually picked the president of the united states. Some people might make a mistake and pick somebody they don't want so if you do it by paper, and give people what the president will do for us peolpe might make the right choise.

So if you really feel the need of taking down the collage go ahead and do it. It will be better and in the future we can make another one and make it bigger and better then the one we have right know. It might hurt some people I know that, but once we get the new one they won't be so dissaponited because you got ridd of the old one. So make a good choise. Most people say ""but it is like a home to me"" they might be saying that because thats what everybody says so take that one down and build a bigger and better one  then the one we have today.

I know there is the bigger states but  you can always split it boys one one side and all the girls on the other .

Look at obama he was suppose to make are country a better place but he is making it worse. so maby if we get a look at them and they tell us what they are going to do right in front of us we might pick a president that is acually going to do what he says, and not make our school lunch so horribale and so little. I'm not tring to be mean to Mr. Obama but he said he was going to make change we all thought it was going to be good change but NO he is making the biggest mistakes. I know we wall make mistakes but he said he was going to make change and so far he is making bad changes.

I'm not saing he is bad president but he said he was going to make change i just wish it was good and not bad. I have lived in the united states all my life and I have never seen this much bad change. I hear alot of bad stuff like world war 3 going to happen and i think to my self and think is this whta the world has came to.

If you get more than what you elected for the other people that you get will possiably turn against you thats why you should only get the people you already have.

I would like to say that the electoral college is not what we should be using to elect our presidents. I think the electoral college is not what Americans need. In the electoral college process, many thing could go wrong. The system does not work as many people think it does, as it is very deciving and unfair. Over half of all voters agreed that we should abolish the system and go by popular vote.

The electoral college is unfair due to the fact that peoples vote is not even going to the president but for his electors. The biggest moral of the country is ""we the people"" have control. The trickery of the electoral college is not allowing this to happen but taking it away. It is mainly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. The electoral college interfered in the the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush by allowing Bush to win even though more people voted on Al Gore in popular vote.

The many flaws in the system or mistake that can happen are more likely in the electoral college. The is a possibility that the two presidents can tie and in which case they have to go through a long process. This can happen due to an even number of electoral votes overall (538). The electors in the state of Louisiana have refused to vote for their party's canidate and vore for whoever they please ant that is not right. You can pay electors to vote one way which is also wrong too considering that not what the people think.

Many people agree that they system should be abolished including two presidents the united states Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Over half of all voters at over 60% agree that the system should be abolished. These statistics were taken in a Gallup Poll in 2000 shortly after Al Gore was not elected.

They don't care what the people got to say, they are only worried about having that power and changing the system. If they every change the system to popular votes for the president it would be a honest choice. I say that because everyone gonna choice a person then other people is going to count and give out the number, whoever has the highest number win. So I think it would be a honestly choice, but in the system everything is organized, everything is already known. This has been done for the longest. Other president already used the electoral system and it wouldn't be fair to use this other system to choose the new president. Everyone knows already what there job is, and if they would have to change it people would be confused. There going to have to start again from fresh. People being not sure if they doing it right or wrong, and it would take longer to choice a president.

So just think about i just said. It might help you choice the right choose but it might not, but i still think that the electoral system is a way better way to help choose a president. There is step to choosing him. There are people that already know what to do with there job, its easy for them. So many times they did it that they are professional at doing it. If we would change it, like I already said they would be confuse, lost. In my opinion the electoral system is way better an easier. Everything is known and better. Its in the constitution. People already knew about this and now y'all trying to change everything. It wont make some people happy some of them gonna get                            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
126039773F9A,"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, I strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. If you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaine. On the other hand, i do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some of the regiment in voters. In Plumer's article he says,"" - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, I think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, I believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attenetion to the votes sent out. Acorrding to Plumer's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states, "" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for who the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. If you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisified and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why I believe that  getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in who they vote. If they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article, ' In Defnse of the Electoral College:', Posner states, "" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have beter interest in voting if they had  popular vote and no more electoral college. I believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. I believe you should get rid of the electoral college so there will be less arguing.

8CF7664615CB,"My opinion is that the electoral college should be abolished.  In source two paragraph eleven Bradford gives a interesting statement to leave the reader thinking why.  ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"", mentions the article.  I think what she is trying to say is that the system is prepared for chaos and that is what might happen in the future if things do not change.

The electoral college system can at many times be irrational.  In source two paragraph thirteen the author puts out a bold and straight forward opinion.  ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"", mentions Bradford.  The author is trying to say that our popular vote created by the people is no longer cared for when electing our president, it is all up to the electoral college.

What do you think about the electoral college?  In source three paragraph fifteen Richard A. Posner gives a very well put together decription of what we call the electoral college.  ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" The electors are who is actually electing the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential canidate you are really voting or a slate of electors instead.

Overall the electoral college is an unfair, outdated, and irrational system.  Do you really think your vote counts?  They are lying to you, because it does not. They are who decides our president.                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
C3C4D847175E,"The Electoral College has many amazing things people like about using it .When it comes to voting not many people do .Thats why in the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are about 538 electors, now that's alot of people if you ask me. Only 270 of the electoral votes is required to elect the President which is an okay amount of votes for the President election.

On the other hand, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who inturn elect the president. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themeselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows much worse. People are more worried about having a tie in the electoral vote. The election would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegation vote on the President, also the senate would choose the Vice President.

Not everyone thinks the same tho about electoral College because some people dont like it because some states have more representatives,but yet again what if it was your state that have the most representatives like Califorina with 55 of them wouldnt you want a huge avantage like that?

0C2CD7E1B791,"Dear senator please keep the electoral college. There a few reasons why we should keep it heres a few. The electoral college is a easy way of picking the president the most popular canidate with most votes is the winner. Also each party picks a nominee and trust is very rarely betrayed.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college system is a fairly simple way of voting that most people understand replacing it with something else would just instill alot of mis understanding in people ,wich could possibly result in a huge decrease in the amount of people that vote. Also the negatives of the electoral college are not really a big deal that coud cause a fixing or a inbalenced vote towards one side over another.

C999D5A67A4C,"Dear state senator,

Many people do not think that the Electoral College is not fair, or exact. In fact, people wanted to boycott it in 2000. I suggest that we change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is fair to the candidates and to the people of our country, and we should be able to choose our president, not the electors. Also, if we keep the Electoral College, voting will be unfair and it only makes people want to stop voting. I will explain to you the details of these reasons why we should change it in the rest of my letter.

To begin with, we should change to popular voting because it is fair to everyone. The people want a fair election. Presidents can be chosen wisely by the people, and candidates will be chosen fairly. People want a safe election, so that they can feel safe and protected with the president that we all chose together. It is only unfair to not let us have the advantage of expressing our own opinions. That is a reason why we should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president .

The second reason why we should change to popular voting is because we, as in the people of the United States, should have the advantage of voting for our own president, not the electors. The people know what they want and need to vote for the candidate based on their own opinions. Electors have different opinions, which is not fair at all since we are not really voting. They are only changing our votes and not agreeing with the votes of the people. That is the second reason why the government should change the Electoral College to election by popular voting for the president.

A disadvantage of keeping the Electoral College is that it is unfair and it makes less people want to vote for a president. In 2012, only half of the whole United States voted for a president. They did not think voting was really necessary anymore, since we are not really voting. It also makes the people feel worthless since their votes do not really count anymore. We basically do not have a say in our own country, and that is not fair to us or the government. That is why keeping the Electoral College is a bad idea, and we should change it.

This is why you should reconsider changing to popular vote, for the good of our country. It is honestly a much better process for our country , the citizens, and especially for the candidates that want to make a great difference in the place we live in. Popular voting is fair to candidates and people, we should choose our president, not electors, and the Electoral College is unfair and makes less people want to vote. Thank you for reading and listening to my letter. Have a great day.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FEF701EACFBB,"The electoral college is a very controversial topic.  It has been debated by important figures like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole (Plumer).  While some people agree with Bradford Plumer and say that we should abolish this method, others stand behind Richard A. Posner, wanting to keep the electoral college.  Although the electoral college restores some of the weight in larger states, it is a very unfair method for voting on our president.  The electoral college allows someone to win the presidency who did not win the popular vote, and, if a tie occurs, the outcome is demeaning to larger states.

The electoral college does have a favorable trait.  It restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution (Posner). The senate only appoints 2 representatives per state, no matter how large their populations are.  The electoral college gets rid of this problem, assigning representitives to states based on population.

While that aspect of the electoral college is beneficial, it may be the only thing.  The electoral college is an extremely unfair method.  Just take the 2000 election, for instance.  Al gore won the popular vote but, thanks to this flawed method of selecting our president, lost the presidency (Plumer).  This was uncalled for.  If someone wins the popular vote and is wanted as president by the majority of people, then they should be president.  Our president is a position of the utmost importance.  We should have a leader that the majority of the people want.

Not only is the actual process unfair, but if there ever happens to be a tie it's even worse.  In the event of a tie in the electoral vote, the election is passed on to the House of Representatives, who then have the state delegations vote on the president (Plumer).  However, the catch is that each state gets only one vote (Plumer).  This means that the single represenative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters (Plumer).  This process is extremely unequal and should not be allowed.  Everyone should be able to have equal representation and play a part in critical decisions like this one.

All in all, the electoral college is unfair and people despise it.  According to a poll in 2000, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (Plumer).  The electoral college, while it may restore some of the weight in larger states, is detested all across the United States.  The person with the popular vote doesn't always win, and, in the event of a tie, the process is even more unfair than the actual method itself. The electoral college is an awful process that the majority of people don't want.  So why is it still here?            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5862444FFB9D,"When you think of voting for president, do you think of the white house, your nearest voting station, absentee ballots, or Electoral College? Is Electoral college a good thing or does it leave some states in the dust? In my opinion we need to drop electoral college and vote ny popular vote. In the article ""What is the Electoral College?"" The authors,the office of Federal Register, say that ""you help choose your states electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"".(the office of Federal Register p.6). It states that when you vote you are not actually voting for the candidate you want but his or hers electors, Hereby proving that you are not voting for the President of the United States, but for the hope of your vote counting.

Every state has a certain number of electoral votes. Some have high amounts known as ""swing votes"".  An example of a swing state would be California with a whoping 55 electoral votes. States like this are more likely to see the candidates speak and do more campaigning, due to the high number of electoral votes. But what about other states who have to see their future President through a tv screen because they dont have as many electoral votes as larger states. For example a less visited state would be Rhode island with only one electoral vote becuase of the small population. In the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner it states that ""They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average(and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election""(posner p.3 swing states). This statement is saying since the bigger states with more electoral votes are the most informed they should be the ones to decide. ""Why are they more informed"" you might ask?, Becuase ther are the bigger states and have more attention from the candidates than smaller states. Any state with large Electoral Colege votes are basically choosing our countrys leader and just because we live in a smaller state means we have very little to no say?

More people would be informed of our candidates and care more about the election if they knew individually they got a say without the rest of the state triumphing over their vote. If a candidate sees that a state with fifty five Electoral College votes is not liking him , and if a state with only three electoral college votes isnt for him, the candidate will go for the higher amount of votes state. How are we supposed to be united and one as a country if a larger state has more votes than a smaller one therefor gets more attention and time from a future President."" Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were picked by popular vote...""(Posner p.5 avoid run off elections). If they have no incentive to pay attention THEN GIVE THEM INCENTIVE! Many people who are the appropriate age to vote complain about people not voting but if they think their vote will not matter than why would they?

Popular vote can insure that every single American can have a vote of their own and not grouped together with the rest of the state. I think that knowing your opinion and voice can count and truely make a difference matters in a situation like voting for president. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president""(Plumer p.10). As it says we are not even voting for our president but for votes.

If the United states president was elected by popular vote then it wouldnt matter what states got more attention and ""how many more states do i have to win over to be the president?"" but a true genuine popular vote for the leader of our country. That is why we need to abolish the Electoral College and get on with the popular vote situation.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F327656C9CA7,"Dear Senator,

In my opinion we should change the presidency election to be based on popular vote. I can speak for a lot of citizens here when I say that it is a way of representing our country as a democracy, and is more efficiant.

The electoral college is a better representation of a democracy. Instead of voting for your president, you're instead voting for electors. That's not what we're trying to do. The political parties of Florida are trying to get their candidate to be elected. The electoral college is a bit unfair to the other parties that aren't gettin represented. Since most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system, not all voices are being heard. With popular vote everyone's voice is being heard! We are a democracy right? Democracy means that all citizens have a say in the government. Which plays into the voting topic. We vote because we have a say in what goes on in the government, and what the decisions they make. With the electoral college, we vote for electors that vote for the president, even though the title of the event is called the presidential election! Not the electoral election!

Another reason many people prefer the popular voting system is because it is more efficiant. This is because we can't always count on the electors we vote for to reperesent us correctly. Electors might change their mind at the very last minute and decide that they like the opposing candidate's view, discarding their loyalty to us. Now the opposing candidate has more electoral votes casted their way. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for. That's not what I would call a trustworthy system. With the electoral college, it is a slighter chance that a tie could happen. With the popular votes, there is more votes being casted to almost prevent this from happening.

The popular voting sysem is a better way represent this country as a democracy, as well as being more efficiant. This sounds like a better America to me already. SO please keep all this in mind next time you go to work.

23F613EA5253,"Why the Electoral College Should be Replaced

Dear Mr. Senator, ever since the Presidential Election of 2000, the concept of our electoral college has been highly scrutinized, and this is rightly so. The electoral college is undemocratic, unfair, and should be replaced with the popular vote.

Even people who support keeping the electoral college (such as the author of

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , Richard A. Posner) agree that ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense.."" (paragraph 15). America was founded on democracy and making sure that the people's voices were heard, and not allowing the people to directly vote for the leader of the country goes against that.

The electoral college is also extremely unfair to voters. Because of how the election system is set up, a candidate could win the people's popular vote, but not the electoral votes and would then not recieve presidency. This occured in 2000 in the Gore vs Busch election. Even though a majority of people voted for Gore, Busch still ended up with the presidency (paragraph 9). Having the electoral votes take pecedence over the popular vote takes away the people's voice and bscially tells them that their opinion doesn't matter as much as the electoral college's opinion.

The electoral college is also unfair because it discourages campaigning in non-swing states. A democratic candidate would not campaign in a state like California that is heavily democratic because they know they are almost definitley going to win the election in that state, meaning they will get all of that state's electoral votes. A republican candidate would not campaign in Caliornia either because they know they would have almost no chance of winning in such a heavily democratic state, and they would be wasting campaign money with no hope of electoral votes from that state (paragraph 13). This means that people in non-swing states like California don't really know much about either candidate because they were never informed. Then the people in these states tend to vote for their party solely because they have nothing else to go off of. It is unfair for voters in non-swing states to be left in the dark just because all of the electoral votes are almost guaranteed to go one way. If the US used popular votes for the Presidential Election, republicans in democratic states and democrats in republican states would have a voice too.

Another way the electoral college is unfair, is the standing procedure in the event of a tie. There are 538 electors in the electoral college (paragraph 3) which is an even number, meaning the electoral votes for each candidate could be tied. In the event of a tie, the House of Representatives would have an election and each state would get one vote. That would mean ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" (paragraph 12). This would make someone from California's vote count for much less than someone from Wyomig's vote.

It can be argued that the electoral college is beneficial in the fact that the winning candidate's share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to 51.3% of popular votes (paragraph 18). Some say this is beneficial because it reduces the chance of a dispute of vote counting. However, this is actually not a good thing. 51.3% of people wanted Obama to be President. Not 61.7%. Yet Obama still got credit for 61.7%. About 10% of voters who didn't support Obama didn't get their opinion heard.

The electoral college has been around for a long time, and it's time for a change. It is simply undemocratic and unfair. It prevents every person for having an equally weighted vote. The electoral college needs to be replaced with a popular vote.

Thank you for your time Mr. Senator.

129C9D585CB5,"Electoral college is a dictator, boss, or lottery! It's unfair. It is the duty and privledge of the people to select our government leader. We should choose based on our point of view. The second source conveys effective points to consider, such as, directly voting for the president and the disaster factor. It also informs us that, even though unlikely, there is possibility of a tie.

Directly voting for a president is an issue addressed in both source 2 and 3. They agree that technically, we're not really voting for a president. The second source tells us that when we vote, it is actually sent to the state elector, and it is they (electors) who vote for the president. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer voting directly over our system now. Even though source 3 gives us reasons to keep the electoral college, it will support us when we say we aren't actually voting for the president directly.

Source 2 gives us the ""single best argument"" against the elector college as what it refers to as the disaster factor. It uses the fiasco of 2000, the biggest election crisis in a century, as an example of why we are so lucky. The state legislatures were technically responsible for picking elctors and they didn't always have to listen or acknowledge the people's opinion/vote. It takes us further back by giving an example of segregationists back in 1960 where John F. Kennedy almost lost the popular vote of Louisiana when their legislature replaced Democratic electors with new ones that opposed him (Kennedy). What source 2 calls ""faithless"" electors, electors who dont believe that their candidate will win; hence faithless, have occasionly voted in favor of their choice, disregarding the decision of the people.

The third source gives us five reasons in favor of the electoral college method. Even though we don't directly vote, the party chooses the elctors and trust that they will select the voted nominee, and it ensures us that the trust is almost never decieved. Disputes over the outcome because of an Electoral College Vote is possible, but not as likely as the popular vote. The next reason given informs us that a region doesnt have enough electoral votes to win the election for the president they favor. ""Swing States"" is another reason. It refers to states that can be persuaded and aren't neccesarily entitled to a particular candidate, so they will really pay attention to what the cadidates have to say, their campaign. ""Big states"" is the fourth reason and is focused on population advatages. Meaning, a state with smaller population will have just as much impact on the election as one with a larger population, its equal. It is not neccessarily a good thing when the last reason says ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elctions in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"". Wouldn't that raise the risk of a tie? Though, it is extremely unlikely that a single vote may decide the president and voters in these elections want to express their opinion and prefernece.

A77AD4253314,"Dear State Senator,

I favor on changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. It is time for change to our voting system. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. five reasons for retaining the electoral college is, the certainty of the outcome, anyones president, swing states, huge states, and avoidment of run-off elections. The first reason is, in  2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vot when romney only got 51.3 percent. the peoples popular vote wanted romney to win. I beleive it isnt fair that the electoral vote has the final say, there is more of the U.S citizens than the electoral college. The second reason is, the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trnasreginal appeal. residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isnt thir president. The third reason is, swing states. voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, so the most thoughtful voters should be the ones who decides the election. The fourth reason is big states get more attention from from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state which isnt fair or equal. the electoral college favorites of of bigger states. the fifth and last reason is that the electoral college avoids the problemof elections. The electoral college method of selecting the president, may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying there state. voters in the U.S presidential election are people who are exspressing a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

5C3B847556AC,"The Electoral College has been in the Constitution since out founding fathers established it.  It was an agreement between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of President by a popular vote of citizens.

As we all know the Electoral College is a process which is the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress.  There are two political parties. Democrats and Republicans. Electors are usually chosen by the person running for office's political party, but each state has their different views on how they are selected and what their responsibilities are.  When the time comes, usually every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, presidential elections are held. This is the day citizens go out to their local polls and help their electors vote for President. It's not the citizens themselves who vote for the President, when citizens vote they're actually voting for their canidates electors.  The process of the Electoral College has been carried on since it was first put into the Constitiution. So, why change it now?

The Electoral College consists of over 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.  The citizens vote sometime in November in polls and wait for the election of the new President. As stated before, the citizens vote does not elect the president, it helps the electors choose. However, that doesn't mean that the citizens don't have a purpopse in voting. Popular vote is part of an election as well. It is rare that the Electoral College is higher in numbers that its popular votes. This is sometimes because states award electoral votes on a winner-takes-all rubric.

This process requires a canidate to have trans-regional appeal, meaning there aren't favorites. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.  This also means the presidential canidate will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states they know they'll win in. This is a highly unlikely result that will outcome as a successful president. If this were to occur, voters in other states would feel discouraged and feel as if their votes do not count. This is why the Electoral College has this as a requirement.

In most toss-up states, voters are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and deciding or knowing who that they will decide to be president. They are most likely thoughtful voters and are perferred to be the ones to decide the election. In big states, the Electoral College adjusts the weight in the political balance that these states lose by population. In additon, large states get more attention of canidates in a campaign that the smaller states do.

These are just few of many resons why the Electoral college should stay as is. If they were to change the Electoral College, what would they do to elect a president? It would be chaotic and the people may rebel. In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College as it is should be the only process to elect a president.

1C7FDCD3337C,"Dear Senator,

What do you think about descarding electorial voting?,do you feel that it would be best to keep it this way,or do you think there should be a change? What you think i dont know. But

In my opinion i recomend that the electorial voting should not be changed.

One of my main reasons for this is electorial voting has mostlikely been going on for decades,and why would you deside to change this now? This act could possibly throw some important things off track. For example if you were to go fourth with this act you could possibly risk people selecting the wrong president and his electors,which then could risk people to lose there jobs,homes,end up homeless,etc this could be avoided if you keep things how they are and not end up messing things up changing electoral voting.

Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,and Bob Dole feel differently with my reason,they all feel that you should abolishe the electoral voting,they thaat sence Al Gore lost the presedency but won the popular vote they think that people are being cheated out of there vote and its not fair. I disagree with them because the senators have a say in who is going to win the election and be president all at the end,so why worry.

In conclusion people should not worry about what happens with the House Of Represintative,or the election,i'd tell folks to leave that up to the senator to decide because there people like us,and im sure they wouldent want someone causing trouble in presedency.

EA1D34C41DE6,"Dear senator, the Electoral College has always been a good way to elect our leaders, and it is the best way to do it. It has the ability to use swing states for better voting, larger and smaller states get diffrent amounts of electoral votes, and presidents cannot be elected by a region alone.

The effect of having swing states because of the Electoral College is a positive one because when a state feels like they have a chance of having their candidate win, they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts. Having voters put more thought into their votes instead of not caring as much gives the better candidate a greater chance of winning, if one candidate was truly better than the other. The more thoughtfull canidates in a swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns. Popular vote does not use the winner takes all method so the idea of swing states will no longer have any effect in the election.

Another great reason why the Electoral College is better than popular vote is because depending on the size of the states a certain amount of votes is given to the electors. Larger states get more attention from presidential candidates because of the majority vote in the particular state. if there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time on smaller states when they could of been winning larger states. The varying amount of electoral votes for each state depending on its size also allows for a more equal and fair election, due to the less populated states not being able to have more electoral votes then the more populated states.

The Electoral College allows that presidential canidates cannot win the election by reigional appeal. This means that if a particular reigion favors a candidate they cannot win by only a single regions votes. This makes the candidates campaign less in regions that are more likely to be won and more in other regions. But with the Electoral College this makes it harder for a candidate with only regional appeal to win because other regions feel like their votes will not be as effective towards the election. With popular vote a presidential candidate will not know where to campaign and where not because there is no winner take all method.

This is why I belive that having the Electoral College is superior to popular vote when we the people vote for presidential candidates.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

In a democracy the people should get to elecct their leader. I know that the Electoral College is usually gives the same results as the popular vote but its not always 100% accurate. There is honestly no reason to have the Electoral College. The founding fathers put it in place but that was 200 years ago and I have no idea what they were thinking.

I think the Electoral Collage is unfair to the citizens of the United States of America. The Electoral collage resembles too much control by the United States government.

I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. In source 3, It tries to tell you all the possitive things about the Electoral Collage... The possitive things they mention about the Electoral Collage are small compared to the issues with it. The Electoral Collage is outdated and needs to be taken off. It is just unfair now.

DF65CB93928B,"The electoral college doesn't work for everyone its not fair. There are people who want a good president to run the conutry, not just some guy that the electors pick. Electorl College is not a good way to pick a president the people are not picking them isnt that want it suppost to be people pick the president not electors. In the text the author write that the electorl college doesnt let the people that have the most vote win because your picking a elector and the elector is picking the president even though he/she has the most vote its not fair. We the people should be the ones picking the president, we are the one who want him/her to run the coutry because we think he/she can do it.  The electoral college should be abolishied and people should pick the president.

There are state in our conurty that are smaller then other states. Those small states dont get a say in the voting for the president because the bigger states rule over because of the electorl college rule. The author says ""larger states like Flordia has 29 electorl vote and Wyoming only has 3 electorl votes."" So that means that the larger states get more attention form the president then the smaller states do. That's not fair the smaller states should be treated like the bigger states not left out. The electrol college (electors)is the one picking the president not the peoplein the small or large states.

AB3E22D82AE0,"Why do we keep this despised method of choosing the president when 60% of American citizens want a popular vote instead? This is an outdated method and viewed as anachronism by many. While some say that it creates a more stable outcome, it is a ""winner-take-all"" system where not everyones votes count. The election of the president should be based on popular vote because it is unfair that not everyones votes count, their is a chance of a tie breaking out, and the disaster factor because so much could go wrong. Although it seemed like a good idea at the time, it is unfair and irrational to all voters in the United States.

It is injustice that not everyones votes count under the Electoral College. The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of votes by congress. Voters are directly related to this because the popular vote of a state usually gets the electoral vote of the state. This is good for the majority but what about the minority. The Electoral College is a winner-take-all system so their voice does not get heard. If a voter is democratic in Texas it would be a waste of time voting, because  most of texas is republican and the 38 votes would go twords a republican. If it was based on popular voting then the minority would get a say and could help.

One of the most worrying situations is the prospect of a tie in electoral votes. Because the Electoral College is made up of an even 538 electors, Their is the possiblilty of a tie. If that were to happen, then the electin would be thrown into the House of Representitives, where state delegations would vote on the president. This would be a problem because some states, such as Wyoming, would only get one or two votes but others, like California, would get more than thirty. Also, the House of Representitives would vote for the canidate they want, not reflecting the will of the people at all. If a tie seems unrealistic, just remember in 1968, 41,971 votes would have created a complicated mess.

Moreover, their is the disaster factor, Their are many problems and kinks in the system and some of these can destroy the system. The worst one we ever expiriednced is the recounts in Florida in 2000. The state legislature could always pick electors that will defy the people. In 1960, the Louisiana state legislature almost changed Democratice electors with ones that would vote againts John F. Kennedy. Also in 1960, Hawaii sent two states of electors to congress. Perhaps the worst is a party's canidate casting a vote for whomever they please, ignoring the people. This is one of the biggest downsides of the Electorial College.

The Electorial college is no longer usefull or democratic. If instead we vote the president on popular vote we won't expirience the unfairness to voters, the problems of a tie, or the disaster factor. It can help in some situations but for the most part is spurious at best. The Electorial College is outdated, unfair, and non- democratic and should be replaced by a popular vote.

F8FB4470A52F,"Dear Senator,

""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(Office of the Federal Register1). Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected. For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process.

In Richard Posner's, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" he incorporates in his defense, that the electoral votes are awarded in a winner-take-all basis, which means that the states play an important role in the deciding factor of who will become the next President. Posner explained theoretically, ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 perecnt of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state"" (Posner 1). With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the canidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not aknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. Furthermore, the Electoral College alllows for everyone to have the chance to be apart of the elections. The Office of the Federal Register explains, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" (The Office of the Federal Register 1). This adds suppprt that at the end of the election, almost every part of an election including votes, is taken into consideration, thus making the election a sucessful one.

In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, ""What Is The Electoral College,"" there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the canidates and the citizens who are voting. This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, "" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, "" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election""(Posner 1).  Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

Lastly, the Electoral College is the best way to determine a president, but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ""... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer 1). The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, "" Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors..."" (Plumerr 1). This is true but also could be a little dramatic. Ultimately, the citizens are the ones who are voting for the candidates not the electors. Without the vote from the citizens there would be no electors. The Electoral College process should still be kept even though there are some issues.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Posner 1). The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.                                                                             ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
23BF06965E36,"Dear state senator, I believe that you should keep the Electoral College rather than the most popular vote for the president. ""The founding fathers established it"". Basically this method has been going on since George Washington. How it works is you choose either your Republican or Democratic president, and depending on who has more votes for the president. The electoral votes go to the republican or to the democratic.

Citizens of the United States also voted upon this selection. In the passage "" The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it talks about how the candidates don't make it to every state. How could they? They are trying to promote and sign papers. They have a life too you know. They can't be in every single state in America. You could also see them on the Televeision if you want.

The Electoral College doesnt have the problem of elections in which ""no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" Evene if more people voted for the democratic or Republican president they still aren't gonna get what they want. Some people in 2008 wanted that other president, not Obama, to win. In school they were saying how he was racist and that they shouldn't vote for him. He wanted to put all the Mexicans back in Mexico.

B2F4B9604E5F,"Do you think its time to get rid of Electoral College? Or change to election by popular vote for the presdient of the United States?

An Electoral College constist of 538 electors but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. To win so easily by just getting Electoral votes just seems really unfair. We should change to election by popular vote for the president of United States because it seems like a more fair challenge to earn the title of President of the United States.

Each candidate running for presdient in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generaly chosen by the candidates poltical party, but state laws vary on how the electors are slected and what their responsibillites are.

What the electoral college system does is you dont vote for the president, you vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. As an example of Electoral college system , Stated in paragraph 10 ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, And wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, You'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. On the off-change that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to cocngress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes"". The electors can be anyone not holding a public office.

That just doesnt sound fair to win an election just by having more electoral votes, when you have less popular votes.

Basically the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winnter-take-all ssytem in each state. Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. 25 if the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the prsidency in the hands of a few swing voters Ohio, They have yet to make it.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It doesnt make sense to have such a thing for out presidents.

33008B95DE9C,"Dear State Senator,

I think that our president's should be chosen by popular vote because they have better chances of winning and they will know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States.

The president's have better chances of winning because they can have the most votes and wouldn't have to wait on the Electoral College. Such as paragraph 9 says, ""Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" I think that was unfair because Al Gore could of been the president but instead he was not, after all the campaigning he did to get those voters to vote for him it ended up as a waste because the voting didn't get him anywhere. If I was a president I would be highly upset because I knew I could have a big chance of losing just because of the Electoral College. What doesn't make any sense to me is that the voters are not voting for the president but are voting for a slate of electors. What's the whole point of voting then? People are out here voting for electors that they don't even know and most of the electors are people who not holding public office. In paragraph 13 it says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" To me they are cheating people out of their votes, people vote for the one that they think could make a change not just voting just to be voting.

The president would know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States. The electoral college votes won't help them know who is really for them and who's not because if someone win over electoral votes there are going to be people out there mad about the fact that they had won. This will make people not want to vote at all because 9 times out of 10 the person they are voting for gone lose. The electoral college just makes it difficult for the people that are running for president. I'm not saying that it should be easy to just become something big, but if you worked hard enough I think that you should be honored enough to become president through popular votes. This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to recieve all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" What would happen then? That's why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it.

I hope what I have really proved my argument that we should change the way a president is chosen so it can be fair to everyone. I think this will make the incoming president feel confident in himself to make this happen.

3B9A70FC3744,"When the US Constitution was first made, the idea of equality between the states was made. This meant that the size or population of a state gave it no disinct advantage over another. They did this through the creation of the House of Representatives and the Senate, yet there was one more issue they had to solve. This issue was how they could count the votes of citizens all aroun the US fairly. They solved it with electoral college, a system in which the voters don't directly vote for the president, but vote for a group, or slate, of people who have sworn to a canidate who vote for you. This system as Source 2 states can easily be broken with a group of swing votes in some states, but because it keeps thing equal, we must see that making popular vote the process isn't a good idea, because larger states will have more power. The US should just remove the winner take all system and replace it with 'proportional representation"" to preserve equality and functionality.

The first reason why we must change to proportional representation is because it preserves equality. As Source 1 states, this proportional representation is only done by Maine and Nebraska, but it makes it so that one party wont win the state, it is reigional in the state meaning that more people are represented through this. The winner take all system is too harsh, and can discount many people in swing and regular states. As Source 3 stated, the larger states need to be left alone to represent the US population. Proportional representation allows this with the ability to include even more opinions. With this informatin, it is easy to see how proportional representation will preserve the equality that popular vote represents.

The second reason why we must change to proportional representation is because it preserves functionality. One of the main arguments for electoral college, is that  it is more functional as compared to popular vote. This can be maintained through proportional representation. Source 3 stated that while the reguar electoral college has a chance of failing, it is not as high of a chance as popular vote is. Proportional representation keeps this functionality that those who support normal electoral college hide behind. This is also been proven to work without a hitch. As previously mentioned, Source 1 stated that this for of electoral college is already in Maine and Nebraska. These states have proven that this form of electoral college works, thus proving that we should change to proportional representation in order to maintain the functionality of regular electoral college.

In conclusion, we should switch the rules of electoral college from ""winner takes all"" to ""proportional representation"" in order to maintain equality and functionality. showing that while the founding fathers did have the best on their minds when electoral college was made, a change in it can benifit America for years to come.

F5AF925324E7,"After a presidential election, citizens soon start to realize that their word doesn't matter. The Electoral College are the voters that mean more to the presidential candidates, and it is a disrespectful system to be the face of our ways of democracy. In these sources citizens and governors want to abolish this system of voting and deciding a blind fate for America. The people vote for the electors not the president, the electors elect the president not the people, and the possibility of the disaster factor happening on future elections. Popular vote doesn't seem to have much of a purpose anymore because the electors seem to be making the desicions in this country.

Starting off, the people of this country need to know on what they are voting on rather from what they thought they could of been voting on. The Office of the Federal Register state,"" You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president"" (soure 1). They insist that we are basically voting for a possibility to get the candidate we want or to be betrayed and vote for the other party. Truly this means that this system is cheap and could backfire. Not only that but half or a little over half of citizens seem to take responsibility to vote, in that case it makes it harder to get the electoral votes to go in favor of popular votes. Our votes only exsist to help choose votes.

Asisting the first claim, our votes are unexistent. Richard A. Posner claims,""it is the electors who elect the president , not the people""

(source 3). Right of the bat the Constitution and it's preamble is disrespected by this system. The preamble says that we as citizens of this country are the voice of this land and would further on insist or choose what we want it to be known as. But, that can't necessarily happen if we don't vote. Posner also says "" ( and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (source 3). Even though this is a fact there is still the possibility or the potential to be nailed or betrayed by the electors. If there is a possibility in something unfair to happen by law it should be taken down and changed for our safety. Yet this happened in 2000 , when W. Bush aquired more electoral votes than Gore but Gore had more popular votes. A plurality only has a chance to win electoral votes.

additionally, the system could supposively allow for much worse tricks and grief. Bradford Plumer describes ""The single best argyment agaisnt the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"" (source 2). The disaster factor includes legislatures replacing the Democratic electors with new ones and this happened in the 2000 fiasco. This is were the popular votes and higher that the electoral votes given to the president. Knowing that the legislatures could succesfully replace or revise or votes into the opposing party. Voting campaigns seem to just be a game , the electors want to win so 17 sates didn't even have the chance to see the candidates at all. This is the system sudgested by our founding fathers and it is a mockery to let it stay and bring judgement to our votes.

It is humorous to and unfair to see the electoral college take over our votes. It seems that our votes are only seen as jokes. As if the whole preamble was a way to joke around with the citizens and give them hope. Many governors want to Abolish the electoral college, and most of us should take responsibility to vote for this and dismantle the electoral college from ever taking over our voice. The disaster factor, the way on how the electors decide, and how we vote for the electors not the president, are prime examples on how irrational this system is. The only way to get our voice back is to ablolish it and start over fresh with a new system in mind.               ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

But by changing the electoral vote to a popular vote shows how committed, selfless, and enthusiastic the candidates are about their jobs. Having the popular vote replace the electoral vote gives more authority and input from the people of the United States.

Richard Nicon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole all agreed on abolishing the electoral vote because ""...voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.""(Office of the Federal Register 10) This happened again recently during the presidential election between Clinton and Obama. Clinton won the popularity vote and Obama won the electoral vote. This means that more people voted for Bill Clinton but the electoral college decided to vote for Obama instead.                            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
18860E0DA892,"Dear State Senator,

We should be able to keep the Electoral College because it hasn't caused any harm when it comes to electing president or vice president. As stated in the article, ""The Electoral College is a provess, not a place."" It's a compromise between the election of the president voted by congress and the citizens.""

The Electoral College is where meetings are held to establish who our Presidents and Vice presidents are. As stated in the article, ""The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.""

Each candidate that want to be President that's running in one's state has their own group electors, as stated in the article. ""The electors are generally picked by the candidates political party, state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.""

WE should be able to keep the loft because it has a definite outcome when our president is elected. According to the article, they're five good reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. ""1) certainty of outcome, 2)eveyone's President, 3)Swing states, 4)Big states, 5) avoid Run-Off Elections.

In conclusion, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College because of the positive affects i think it has when electing Presidents.            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
76B73C5144A9,"A huge precentage of Americans want the Electoral College abolished. Their views are justified when the Electoral College fails to reflect the population's opinion. Does it make sense to base our Democracy on this down-trodden way of electing the president? The Electoral College should be abolished for not reflecting the public view,having the chance of making an elector with no intrests for those who elected him,and giving equal power to a state with a lower population to the same as a high one. Although the college gaurantees a victor the other reasons outweight it in comparison.

First of all,the Electoral College should be abolished for failing to represent the population majority. When an American goes to vote it's ""not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president.""(10) Upon seeing the results with the popular vote cast aside by the elector and voting something else entirely how could an average American feel anything else then betrayed? It's due to this that many Americans don't even consider going to vote feeling as if it is a waste of time due to the elector deciding for them. Going to vote for our president should be what represents America seeing as Americans always talk and brag about the amount of freedom we have. Instead it's more of ""who's the elector going to vote for this election""?

In addition, the electors chosen are not even required to vote for who their state has approved of. Giving this power to the elector could possibly make them corrupt and go against the population. An example would be Republicans sending a Republican elector but the elector instead votes for the oppsosite party. It doesn't happen very often but making it even a possibility is a huge risk to the population of that state and could easily incite unrest among the population. It's very possible and the electors""could always defy the will of the people.""(11) Letting someone have that kind of power goes against the very principals of our democracy and should be erraticated.

Finally,the college is not equal when it somes to states and population. When a tie would happen the representatives from smaller states become equal to the bigger states such as Texas. Basically with this equal voting power ""the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""(12) This could go as far as the minority getting the president they want and most of the country's people being dissatisfied,this could lead to a catastrophe not seen by America throughout its existence. It also seems irrational that a state with fifteen times less of a population would still have the same power as the bigger state.

To conclude,the Electoral College fails in many places where an attempt at Democracy is made. It doesn't even represent Democracy when the voting that matters is made from a select group of individuals instead of the population itself. These individuals are not even required to oblige to the majority of the state making voting at the poll seem useless. Where the college does give equal power it is misplaced by giving minorities a chance of overruling the majority. No doubt this ""Electoral College"" should be abolished.

I belive that we need to change the electoral college to just the popular vote. I'ts not a very good way to do an election. So I'm writng this letter to you so that your can talk about it with your fellow senators. It would be much obliged if you would do that.

One of the reasons why we shoouldn't have the electoral college is that it is not fair to smalller states. Just the state of California has more than almost all of the midwestern part of the United States. If we had our election with the popular vote then it would not be bias like the electoral college is.

Another reason why the electoral college is the right method for our election is that it is not fair our voters. Like republicans in california there is no point in voting because democrats are the majority of the state. If it was just the popular vote there vote would actually matter. We need to stop think about the state and start thinking about the people in the state.

I would be satisfied if you would take this topic to your fellow senators and discuss it with them. It's not all about the rich people that live in California that get tthe big vote, it's also about the people who work all day and barley get any pay in Alaska. We need to thin about everyone in the U.S, not just the people in the big states.

The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Why should people give thier time and effort if not all the time they get to control whom they choose. Worst part about some states to even get a chance to choose the electors.

963AD6327365,"Dear Senator,

Concerning the topic of the merits and demerits of the Electoral College, herein abbreviated as EC. The Electoral College, through which our president and vice presidents currently are selected, is an institution that concerns many people in the United States. Some claim that the Electoral College is ""an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner) Though the lack of control over the president of the United States' election is disconcerting, the Electoral College, as you are aware is beneficial to elections, for example, it allows disputes to be settled over ties and complications in the popular voting process to be reduced, and minimises the amount of votes necessary for tallying, the Electoral College also provides accurate representation to citizens in certain areas. However, is this appropriate? Can the single justification for the disconnection from citizens of a nation to their president be justified on convenience? From what most sources suggest, the Electoral College is a safety system, in place to minimize the risk of complications arising from the voting process. The use of the Electoral College in this manner is unsettling to the American voter, and poses many risks for the basis of the United States. Therefore, the Electoral College should not be allowed to continue in its current manner.

Foremost, the EC as a method of back-up to reduce risk of complications in popular voting is inappropriate. In theory, the EC is not invalid; however, the way in which it is implemented is prone to error, or lack thereof, for reasons that harms the voter's representation. As each citizen votes, he/she votes for an EC slate, with each party selecting a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Richard Posner in his publication ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" states that, ""it is entirely possible the the winner of the electoral vote will nto win the national popular vote."" However, Posner, immediately states thereafter, ""yet, that has happened very rarely."" Posner is correct in this case that this phenomena does happen rarely. The reason for this happening rarely is the fact that the EC adopts a ""winner-take-all"" voting scheme, where the majority candidate wins all of the EC votes for a specific state. To understand how this is a poor way of electing a president, a view into one's ethicality is necessary. The president of the United States is meant to represent the largest amount of the population, inevitably, there will be many that are unhappy with their president. Representing the largest amount of the US population requires that the candidate in question, theoretically, receives the most votes by popular polling. An informed American studies the resolutions and principles of potential candidates, and makes an informed decision as to which one represents their resolutions and principles. Upon deciding which candidate suits their needs, this example citizen casts his/her vote. This vote is a marker which signifies that a certain candadate will, if elected, represent this voter most. Should more than 50% of Americans decide that a certain candidate suits them best, that candidate will represent the largest amount of the American population. The EC, in comparison, awards the full amount of votes possible to the winner of the majority of electors. If 55% of the electors vote one way, and 45% in the opposite direction, the 55% will take precedence, and win the total possible votes for that state. Unfortunately, certain citizens who would have been represented accurately by popular polling may be deprived of the representation by the EC. The disconnect between the American citizen and the president of the United States is detrimental to the whole nation, including the executive body.

The Electoral College is criticized to have disconnected the United States citizen from his/her presidential candidates. However, this has been justified with the claim that ""the EC saves the complications of polling the entire American population."" There are inherent risks with polling the entire population: the fact that there are too many votes to keep an accurate count of. Keeping accurate track of said votes, however, is the responsibility of the current president, who, even during the end of his term, must represent the people who voted for him in providing them with a way to elect their president of choice. In this case, ""practical"" justification signifies the lack of interest in allowing the United States citizen to vote. A dispute of outcome in popular vote is high, the possibility of dispute in the EC is less, due to less electors being polled. The EC attempts to provide an accurate representation of the population, ensuring that the candidate selected is a candidate that suits most of each region, not one in specific. Unfortunately, despite efforts, this system is not accurate. Posner states in his publication that, ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election,"" morally, his reasoning is spot-on. An uneducated voter is dangerous to the society he/she lives in, regardless of country. By contrast, the United States guarantees every citizen a right to vote for his/her representatives; pursuant to this mandate, a person of great power cannot be allowed to arbitrate that ""only educated voters should decide the election,"" simply because an educated voter is not defined, and cannot be defined.

Large states also play a role in the EC's inaccuracies. While one may argue that larger states have more citizens, therefore, a candidate chosen by popular vote represents those citizens, regardless of their geographic location, smaller states, argue, conversely, that states, as defined entities, should have the power to have equal representation in congress, and the EC. Reflecting back to the resolution of mal-apportionment of the Senate, two senators were granted to each state, regardless of size. The Electoral College, however, does not apportion this representation evenly for smaller states. Popular vote, obviously, depends on the population of a certain state for a candidate to be elected. The EC also depends on a state's population. Smaller states who do not have many EC votes arguably should have a chance for an equal vote, as the Senate provides for in the United States congress. The EC does not represent this opposite side to representation.

Understanding the root of this argument is crucial to being able to make a difference. Where accuracy is possible, it should be achieved, where accuracy is seemingly impossible, it should be striven for. Allowing the EC to continue in its current manner is inaccurate, by any standard, and sacrifices accuracy and representation for convenience of election. The EC should, when properly instituted, regard itself as a body where the people are further supplemented in their popular representation, not opposed. Senator, I have left the personal remarks to the ending of this letter, but would like to stress my discontent with the EC as it stands today. I understand there are practical limitations that cannot be met, I understand that the EC may be more convenient when it comes to hiring employees to track votes, and co-ordinate the process as a whole, but it is something that must be done, and striven for, in the most accurate way possible. You, Senator, were elected by popluar vote because the population chose you as the candidate that best suited our interests, and were most likely to defend our interests in the face of opposition. Where we have benefitted you from voting as we have, we request you now represent us in the election of our presidential candidate that best suits our interests nationally. For the reasons provided theretofore, we strongly urge a negation of the Electoral college in favour of a more accurate voting method.

They need all of the support they can get in this fight for the world its there world there trying to fight and protect from getting kicked out of the system. They deserve a right to this and in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election if we didnt have the college. In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few voters away from a catastrophe if it dose not hold its self together in the elector college .

The electoral college is unfair,outdated,and irrational. The best arguments in our favor is mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

The first time a vote will not win the national popular vote. yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral vote, but that was the first time since 1888.

In 2012's election for example Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percdent of the popular votes cast for him and romney.

The electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel. This is why we should keep or lose the college electoral for big changes and its like the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates- as we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states.

DE2E4AFB2721,"The electoral college is something that has been loved, hated, and debated on for some years now. We couold abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote. I'ts seen both ways but is there anything we can do about it? Good or Bad.

The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The group of electors for your state are selected by the cnadidate""s political party. So when you vote for a specific candidate you are voting for the electors he is supported by.

So why do people want to aboplish the electoral college completely? Because there are some serious things wrong with it. ""perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (Source 2, Paragraph 4). How can there be a tie in the election of the president? Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midset and vote for the wrong candidate...Yes that is poosible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the ones being selected and aren't always the way they were in their chosing so therefore there can be a serious tip in votes if the electors don't vote for the candidate of the party they were selected by. ""In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a diect election"" (Source 2, Paragrph 1). The people don't want the electoral college anymore, Who's to say they ever did?

But even know some don't want the electoral college there are some who prefer to keep it. ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is ""unlikely to be a succesful president""( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected.

Concluding, both sides have reasonable arguments to if the elctoral college will stay for good or be abolished completely. But it's up tp you to decide which side your own because this is a democracy.. Isn't it?                                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

EB7AFF739701,"Dear, Senator

When voting for the president of the United States we need to make sure he or she will get there job done. I think electoral voting is better than popular voting. There are parites and each candidate running for president in your state had his or her own grop of electors. Thats usually based on the candidate's political party. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. In order for the president to be elected they must have a majority of 270 electoral votes. In the electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. The argument against the electoral college is what they call the disaster factor.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee however, it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic reasons.

The first reason is the certainty of outcome. The outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. It is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote comprared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

To add onto the five reasons we have the second reason that states Everyones President. The electoral college requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised. They would feel this way because there votes wouldnt count. Our third reason we have Swing states these ones are likely to be most thoughtful. For our forth and fith we have big states and aviod run off elections.

To wrap this up i think electoral voting is a much better way of finding out who the president should be. When you do popular voting it doesnt give you a good idea of what the people think.                            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

So in conclusion I belive that the Electoral College should be abolish for an option, because it causes many problems and those problems lead to confusion and arguments that will make look bad the US goverment.

The Electorla College system give no the votes for the candidate of the election, but to the electors that they will choose who the new president would be. The electors could be anyone in sates convections, in states party's central committee, or sometimes the presidential candidate would choose their electors. So to give more infromatiohn to my concerning, the single best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor. in the 2000 fiascop was the biggest election ciris in the century. Consider that the state legislature are responsible for picking the electors, and those elector could decide what to choose. Electors sometimes have refuse to vote for their candidate or party's candidate, and choose whoever they like. It happen whe Vice President Richard Nixonvalidate only his oponet's electors. MOost of the time they fear of a presidential tie, so that it would be throw to the House of Represntatives ,each vote from there it represent 500,000 voters. So the election is only away from catastrophe and problmes to the candidates, the electors and the House of Representatives. So to many the Electoral College is unfair to the voters, because od the system ''winer-takes-all.''...

Many candidates know they are not going to wim, so ther prefer to not make their capaing in the media or around the city, many people even have never see them. So the information gives the conclusion that the Electoral College is unfair, out of date, and to irrational. The best conclusion to these current problem is to abolish the outdate Electoral College.

So if you tink not to abolish the current system, the Electoral College gives an anachosim, a non-democratic method of selecting a president. Each party selects a candidate that their trust and want no nominee. There are five reason for retaining the Electoral College, but also it lacks of democratic issues , and not liberal or conservatives reasons. Firts, a certany of outcome ,

a dispute over outcome over the Electoral College vote .

by giving the electoral vote ti gives more oportunities to a candidate to win in popular vote. The slight plurality crates and oportunitie to the candiate to have a abetter outcome.

Second , the Electoral College needs a presidential candidate. So a solid favorite candidate give oportunity to him. Third the winner-takes-all method give even more better oportunites to the candidates as they get all. Fourth the bigger the satte the better chances are to win the presidential election, a victory of a bigger produce chances to get more electoral votes that boost the numbers. So finally in fifht the Electoral College avoid problems of elections in which candidates received a majority of votes. So in the finally  conclusion you can infer that the Electoral College have problems but also got good parts.

In the end people may think is good or bad,but if you see its ups and downs it have betters good tyhings but still it gives arandom outcome to one of the candidates it could be the favorite or the competition. So is better if the Electoral College is abolish for tis ramsom outcomes.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I believe that we should get rid of  the electoral college system because it has so many flaws. The electoral college has robbed prsidental canidates like (Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob dole, & Al Gore) of their chance of becoming president, even after they won the popular vote, but their not the only ones who wants a change to the way we elect our presidents, recent studies show that over 60 percent of voters would like a change to the way we elect our president.

The second thing that is wrong with the electoral college is that your not voting for the president your voting for the electors who pledged to that person. Also people from larger states are complaining about what happens with a tie because if their is a tie the house of representives decide,but the thing that is crazy is that 1) representative from Wyoming would have a much say a the 55) representatives from California.

The third and final thing that is wrong with the electoral college is that the electoral college is unfair to the voters, because the winner take all system canidates don't spend a lot of time in states they know they will not win. Canidates will only focus on the areas that they know or have a strong chance of winning. Like the year 2000 campaign seventeen states did not see the Canidates such like Rhode Island, & South Carolina, so how do they think they feel not knowing the person running this country?

I strongly feel like you guys should really consider a change to the way we select our president.

Voting for a president is not what it seems to be. The electoral college makes the people's votes so that the electors are actually voted. These electors vote for the president in favor of their party which is not always trustworthy or reliable. The popularity winner can also lose, due to lack in electoral votes. Many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In reality, electoral system is outdated and should be tweaked of how it would work today.

To begin with, Electors that are voted for by the people are not always trustworthy. They're hand picked by their politcal party but sometimes,""-state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsiblilties are...""(Does The Electoral). Voters can't control who their electors vote for president. The electoral college should be changed to popularity votes because, ""-(the) electors could always defy the will of people""(The Indefensible Electoral). This is unreliable and the way of voting by the people can be easily swayed by the electors.

Additionally, the popularity winner can lose by having less electoral votes. Voters can be discouraged to elect their president when really the electors do the job. This situation has happened when,""-Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes-""(In Defense Of). Any election, voters can expect another close election in which the popular winner could again lose the presidency. The electoral college is unstable and this major downside is a factor.

More over, many voters are still confused or don't know how the system works. In this article it states that, ""-voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate""(The Indefensible Electoral). The electoral college does not clarify to voters on what the people are actually voting for. In another article it explains that people actually voted for a slate of electors. This would mean that the author had to reassure the right understanding. Readers of that article who've voted are now in disbelief or shocked.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be addressed to a win by popularity. The electors in favor of their political party are not always trustworthy. The popularity winner can lose due to lack in electoral votes. Also, many voters are confused or don't know how the electoral college works in presidential elections. These facts add on to more cons than pros of the idea of electoral college.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think we should keep our Electoral College because its fair if we get to choose our president and he or she wins then he or she should be president. Some people should consider themselves lucky because of what happened in 2000 with that fiasco and it was the biggest election crisis in a century. Even though there is 270 votes required to vote for the president, whats fun about that is because there be more  votes and atleast people participate in them. Choosing our president is best because when your voting for the president your voting for state electors. Also, it gives chances for people that want to be president or senator. Electoral college is not a place its a process that it lets people choose who they want in the white house. I think people should start taking things seriously because they might think its a joke but its real serious to other people. Under the 23rd Amendent of the constitution,""the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purpose of the Electoral College."" After the presidential election,our governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing all the people who ran for president.

The electoral college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for presisent in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen bt the candidate's political party.

In addition, the presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in november. You can help choose tour state's electors when you vote for predident.  Most states have a ''winner-take-all'' system however, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ''proportional representation.'' Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in tuen elect the president. The single best argument aganist the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. It's like a hurricane for a presidental election. Prehaps the most worring is the prospect of a tie in thre electoral vot. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

To futher inform, at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spen time in states because they no they have no chance of winning. it's like convincing pigs to vote for you. It's offical the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. It's hard to say this but Bob Doloe was right abolish the electoeal college!

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the politiccal balance that lage states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the consition. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast. It can be argued that he electoral college method of slecting for the presisent may turn off potential voters for a candidate.

A1AB71F3352D,"Dear state senator,

As a law abiding citizen, I feel that the American public should have a say-so in the elections of the President, or any other government party leader, and to do so, should be a direct vote. While our Founding Fathers, with all due respect, chose the Electoral College to pick and choose our leaders, this is the 21st centuary. A centuary in which the government upholds too much power.

The government has been critized quite intensely over the last few years over one topic - lying. Lying to the citizens in which it - should - be serving. Although, it doesn't. The government serves itself. So why should we elect a panel of people to elect for us? After all, when we vote, we - I speak for the entire American republic here - imagine us submitting our vote to count directly for our selected representative. Not for some unknown nit-wit to chose a government agent for us. What if said nit-wit lies, miscounts, or purposely puts his own imput into the system instead of the American voting population?

Direct voting is, perhaps, inevitably more efficient. Our votes could run through a machine, much like a state test such as FCAT, anf the total vote could be directed for either candidate. The chances of a tied poll is rather extremely unlikely due to the masses of the American republic. Plus, it singles out the chance of lying in a government of liars.

Swing states wouldn't exist. Instead of singling out a particular area of the country, they'd be, more so, targeting the country as a whole, because then would every individual vote mattered. No one would be left out, and the more honest, obviously more chosen, president would win out, and almost everyone would be happy.

We live in a system at which the government lies, quite fairly, a lot. A direct vote would whip them out of that in the voting process, as the votes, singularly, would matter. Every last one of them. It would also nip the idea that only certain areas, certain states, mattered, because again, every vote would matter. Directing voting is obviously the way to go.

I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. What is the point of voting if the Electoral College decides who wins? Using popular vote means the citizens would actually decide on who would win. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. Who picks the electors in the first place? The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

601547CF479B,"I beieve that we should change the election to popular vote. It's about what the people want and what the majority of the people would like. You would not want people getting a President or Vice President that they do not like their beliefs on how to run a country, or despise to an extended amount. It's not right for the President and Vice President to say a bunch of things and not go through with it to the people. You shouldn't have only a few people vote or the President and not have your own opinion in the say of things.

People can get confused and vote for the wrong elector and not know what they really did. They can get confused and vote for he wrong candidate then the next thingt you know is that you have somebody running your country and you don't like the decisions they make and what they're doing to America.

Also, if there were to be a tie in the voting, they would have to chose the House of Representatives to vote for the President which could cause problems. In each state since they have representatives depending on the population, they wouldn't get the right amount of people to vote if it depends on how many voters are in the election. So it wouldn't be fair or even in that sense. It's not fair to the people of the country.

It's not certain that you will get the right vote because if you go off of electors votes which have completely opposite opinions from you. Electors that have different opinions can lead to voting for somebody who has no hope of carrying their state or country.

7821218AA037,"Dear Senator,

I am arguing in favor of changing the Electoral College to the election of by popular vote. The process of the votes going through the various different places until it finally gets counted and determined who wins the state is unneccesary. The system is not even fair, for example in the year 2000 Al Gore had one the popular vote by 60%. Unfortunatley he lost the presidency because he did not win the the votes of the Electoral College. For a counry that is ran by the people, a vote of over 50% should always win. When you take into consideration how big the United States are, then cut that into half it is still a remarkable amount. Now picture a little over half the people in the United States voting for the same thing.

This process led to the ""biggest election crisis in a century"" says Bradford Plumer. According to this source the system can also allow for much worse. He even says that at the most basic level the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the Winner-take-allsystem that occurs in each state. For the purpose of common sense why would we as a republic use a system that is ""unfair""?

Richard A. Posner says that the method of using the Electoral College method may even restrain potential voters for a specific candidate. All because they know that they're votes will have little to no impact on the outcome of the election. This also leads to the fact that would have no logical reason to pay attention to the campaign they would've picked. Plumer quotes that "" the Electoral College is outdated,unfair, and that Bob Dole was right in saying that we as acounty should abolish the Electoral College"".

When everything is added up  the same words such as unfair,outdated,useless, and unnessary keep coimg up on this topic. Not everybody in this country enjoys the use of the Electoral College and  I strongly feel that eventually in this country the Electoral college will be left in the past and new methods of voting will be of greater use.

AC2463899B0F,"I believe that the Electoral College vote should be abolished because they are not giving citizens their rights to vote, there is certainty of outcome, the winner takes all method that they are doing, and the voting electors are not voting percisely. That is why I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished.

To me I believe that the Electoral College is cruel and unusual punishment, because they are not giving citizens their voting rights. They make it seem like the citizens are going to be the ones voting for the president but in reality the citizens are actually voting for electors whom are going to be voting for the president. The Electoral College is regarded as an anachronism that should be overuled. Its declaring the canidate with the most vote to be the winner, which is not really giving the citizens the chance to vote for they want to be their president. Advocates are arguing about the Electoral College not being a modern sense, and how it is the electors voting for the president and not the people/citizens. When citizens vote for the president they dont actually know that theya re voting for a slate for the elelctors.

They Electoral College has a massive rate in certainty of outcome. Just like the dispute over outcome of votes that happened in 2000 can happen again, because the electors are not being fair with the votes. This is becasue the winning canidate shares his popular vote with the electorals. Just like Barack Obama was elected for president, he only recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to the popular votes of 51.3 percent. Almost all the states award electoral votes with the winner-takes- all mehtod that they created. A tie can be possible in electorals votes but, the total number of votes is 538 which is an even number but, is not very likely that it would happen.

The electors are not voting fair or percisely. It can and has been argued that the Electoral College ways of selecting the president may turn voters for a cannidate who has no hope for running a state. Democrats in either Texas or  Republicans in California dont pay not type of attention to the voting or even to the president that was picked by the popular votes. The Electoral College has no intention in trying to change thier pursiut for electing a president so that citizens will have a chance to cast a vote on picking who they believe should be president.

Should the Electoral College be kept in favor? The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections. Well on the other hand, Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole agreed to abolish the elctoral college and change to election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.It is unfair to the voters because the electors elect the president. Also, not only are the voters voting for electors,they are voting for the canidate's electors when they think they're voting for the canidate. Choosing a president should be elected by the popular vote of people not electors.

To start with,the president of the United States should be elected by the popular vote of the people. The president is there to guide and lead the people. The citizens of the U.S should have the right to vote for who they think should be president. For instance,some residents have a feeling that their votes don't count.

To add,it is unfair to the voters because the elctors elect the the president. Eventhough the electors represent your state,they don't let the people choos who they desire for president. When voting for president, it shouldn't be all about the electors. The Electoral College even has the possibility of turning voters away that voted for a canidate that has no hope for supporting their state.

Further more,the electoral college does avoid problems. Meaning,a canidate cannot receives a certain amount of the votes cast. For instance, when a canidate has more votes than other canidates while not receiving a clear majority oof votes.

0CA9AC7879C9,"Dear State Senator, We should forget about the system of electorial college to vote for a president. It just isn't fair, reason why is beacause you are electing people to vote for the person who is trying to be president of the U.S although that doesnt mean that you both are voting for the same person that's trying to be president of the U.S. The electorial college system is corrupted and needs to stop being used to elect a president.

To begin, In the source 2 they state the following ""60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Reasons why is because the electorial college is unfair it can make the person who had most of the votes lose because of the people who voted for the person to vote for a president choose the other runner up and make the person with the most votes actually lose. This is why people wish to have a direct election so they wont have to worry about their vote not going to the other runner up president.

Secondly, The reason why the electorial college is wrong is because we dont have our own voice; but the slate of electors do which can be pretty much anybody. For example in the article ""What's wrong with the electorial college"" they state (If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that pledged to Kerry) these elctors can be anyone and still doesn't have to be voting for him though.

Although, If the people can rebalence the electorial college system then it can be somewhat a good thing. I can see how it can be somewhat balenced already; stated in the first source ""the whole electorial college has a total of 538 electors. The president you wish to elect has to have a majority of 270 electorial votes in order to win."" That means they need to have 270 more votes than the other president too.

Finally, so should the electorial college be abolished? unless people can find ways to limit the loosing president to come back with electoral votes, then yes this system should be banned.

446CB94BD577,"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided  the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced relegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definate winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winner-take-all"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
A8F2D9005A0A,"Dear State Senator,

After much research, I have decided that the electoral college should not be kept. It is not completley fair, because the citizens think they're voting for their prefered candidate when really, they're voting for that candidate's electors. That means that if a candidate wins the votes of the citizens, he might not win the electoral college votes. This also means that he was not the president that the U.S. citizens wanted, but what the electoral voters wanted. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" they ask the question, ""Can voters sometimes controll whom their electors vote for?"" and they answer, ""Not always."" This proves that the electoral college is not fair. Also, the electoral college shouldn't be kept because some electors will, ""refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please,"" says ""The Indifensible Electoral College"".

""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" says ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" That is more than half of the United States population, therefore we should get rid of it. I believe that we should abolish it along with that 60 percent, thatway when voting, it will be much more fair. Also, it will make choosing the president of the U.S. up to the people.

Some may think that keeping the electoral college is good because, If there is a tie in the election, the electoral college can break it with their votes. Although this does help, it has only happened once, therefore proving to not be needed. Other reasons are because it gives certainty of an outcome, helps big states, and avoids run-off elections, but are also not that important.

In conclusion I, along with 60 percent of the U.S. populaton, believe that the electoral college should not be kept due to its unfairness.

Planning the future, the College of Electoral system has a ""lack of democratic pedigree.""

This make the President learn about the conflicts of the states and what their problem is to try and compromise it. Some people prefer to have elector, because they want to have a political prefrence. In a proportional manner with equal input into the election, the future would have to change making it popular vote wins. In the point of view of other civilians, other people from other regions may feel disenfranchised. Then segregationist will be equal in input taking out the favortism.

December is now here and the elector will vote in a new President. The rules of electing an offical leader may change, but the proccess of being offical doesn't. The President must first prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" witch causes the President to record all the people and information involving in the election. This is for the record of the Congress and National Archives. The proccess of election should change, because of the overall fairness of the amount of voters to electoral votes. This democratic pedigree will give everyone an equallity to voters and amount of input.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Getting rid of the electoral college would be a bad idea because of the ease it puts on voting and it makes the candidates work harder to becaome president.

When a person runs for president they are trying to take on the hardest job possible, running a country. When they are on their campaign they visit states individual amd they spen alot of time on swing states or the big states such as California, Florida, and Texas. without the electoral college it kinda defeates the purpose for them spending as much time as they do in those states because yes they have a large amount of people but so does every other state, the only large difference now is the amount of electoral votes each one gets. where as with the electoral college they spend more individualized time with each state to try to sway the majority to get all the electoral votes since they cant split them between the candidates. it all comes down to who the smarter candidate is and how they spend time and what they are trying to achive. overall the way it is now makes them wotk harder to win the election. with voting no one likes a tie and without the electoral college that can happen.

In 2000 gore and bush had a fiasco with voting in the presidental election and it was the first time since 1888. Gore who had more popular votes than bush only lost because Bush had the most electoral votes. If it was only up to popular votes than it can easily come down to a tie, what then? recount after recount, or simple debate (but who decides that?). In some cases without the electoral college it could actully make the process because yes they dont have to spend much time campaigning in certain states they get to visit smaller states that tend to get neglected during the campaigns so everyone is more of an informed voter when it comes time to vote. lets say bob and sally campaing against each other and with out the electoral college they can go ariund to smaller states and the big ones and when the voting results are in yes they can be closer or larger apart you also see how america feels whenit comes to politics, yes you can see it with the electoral college but it is a smaller amount of votes so it will always be close but seeing how america feels isnt as easy.

When it comes down to voting  the Electoral College is an over all easier way to vote and makes the candidates work harder to win an already hard election to run the country.                                                                ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

One reason you might want to change to popular vote is because of how unfair they can be all because of the winner-takes-all system and this this system is in easch state, and because of that candidates dont spend time in states they know that wont vote for them. Just like you can't pick who you want your president to be.

Voters can't pick who they want their president to be its all the Electoral college. Voters don't even get to vote for the president thay vote for a slate of electors. just like if you live in Texas and you voted for Kerry you didnt vote for him you voted for 34 demcartic electors.

The only argument against the Electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. Americans should feel lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest problem election  in a century.

Given that most voters vote one party for president and another for congress they do this becaus ethis think a tie or deadlock will happen but, consider this. In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 voters would of dead locked the election yet in 1976 a tie would of happen but 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in Hawaii voted the other way.

It can be argued that the electoral  college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas for example or republicans in california knowing their vote will have no effect they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular but of course no voters vote swings a national election and in spite of that about one half the elgible american population did vote in 2012 election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....

I think those two paragraphs from this passage explains why i would like for people to just do popular voting because it makes the people comfortable and who they feel will make a america as best as it can be. That person who is being elected should feel proud and make america safe is what i stronlgy agree and i think others should to because it is a great choice. The elctoral college consist of the selection of the electors the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress and i feel like thats a little too much when people can just vote instead of getting someone as a president who their not comfortable with or familiar with and dont know anything about the person so everyone just vote by the people for the people.

A2FA635C9590,"Electing a new president of the United States of America has been, and always will be, a big deal. One could be a state senator, a member of the legislative branch, or even an average citizen with zero involvement in governmental jobs/issues. The one thing that ties all of these people together - is that they're all citizens. As citizens, these people will care about who is running their country, what plans they have for it, and how those plans are carried out. Therefore, on behalf of the U.S., it is important to elect the correct person to rule a nation and keep it safe. The Electoral College is a flawed system used to elect presidents, and the American voting system should be based on popular vote. A few reasons being that the votes of the Electoral College outweigh the votes of an everyday citizen, and that the Electoral College basically has the final say in who becomes the president of the United States of America.

One of the things that is wired throughout all three sources, is that electoral votes basicallly overpower the votes of the average citizen. When the average citizen does vote, however, their vote does not go toward the president. Their vote goes to the Electoral College, who then vote for the president. ""[...] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner 16). According to an article (that supports the Electoral College), the winner of an election can win without owning the popular votes of an entire nation. Basically, all that a candidate even needs is the majority votes of the Electoral College in order to win an election. ""[...] according to a Gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college - won the popular vote but lost the presidency[...]"" (Plumer 9). Collecting the votes of the Electoral College is the only concern of a candidate - therefore the only reason that candidates speak to the people is to influence them to cast votes for the Electoral College, which then cast votes for that candidate. ""[...] Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes [...]"" (Posner 18). It's as if the people are just physical steps that electoral voters use to get to the person that the Electoral college wants to be the president of the U.S.

""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer 10). As mentioned in the article by Richard A. Posner, members of the Electoral College are chosen and expected to vote for their party's nominee. However, people don't always deliver what we expect from them. It is completly possible for an elector to change their mind, and cast their finalizing vote toward the opposite candidate. These members cast their votes directly to the candidate, and they can easily change their vote.                       ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
39E84A5734FF,"We need to keep the Electoral College because it keeps the elections fair. It keeps them fair by allowing the states to be proportionaly represented. Also it makes sure there will not be run-off elections and keeps the presidential candidates from favoring one region.

The Electoral College keeps the election fair because all states are represented proportianly to the population of the state. This allows for the smaller states to have a more impactfull vote on the president. Since each state is represented equally the election is more fair than if just a popular vote was taken. This system is called unfair by some because they think that their vote is not being heard. This is not true because in source one it says that when you are voting for a president, you are actually voting for who your electors are going to vote for. So if you vote say demcratic, thats a vote going toward the elector voting democratic in turn him or her voting democratic for the president.

If the president was elected by a popular vote, there is a risk of run-off elections as shown in case three when Nixion had 43 percent of the popular vote but won the Electoral College allowing for a fair winner to be elected. If we continue to use the Electoral College a clear winner will always be produces, but if we go by popular vote a run-off election can occur. Some people may say that the Electoral College is unfair because the winner of the popular vote may not win because of the Electoral College vote and that is not true. If the president was elected by popular vote he or she who is running can just go for the big states, win them over and all smaller states are left with no signifigant say in the election.

If the Electoral College was not used it would allow presidental candidates to favor different regions making it seem like he or she was just the souths president or the norths ect. So with the Electoral College it makes the candidates branch out to try and win more states that they usually would not try to appeal to. In source two the speaker says ""The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance winning. This statement is not true because the Electoral College forces the cadidates to branch out to get more votes. And if the runner knows he or she won't win that state why spend money and other reasources on a rewardless cause.

When all is considered about keeping the Electoral College the only answer should be to keep it. It keeps the election fair by giving smaller states a bigger impact. It keeps run-off elections from taking place, and makes the candidates branch out to other states.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
43612C840EE7,"Dear state senator,

I think that we should keep the Electoral College. By keeping the Electoral College, there will be no problems in elections to where no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The process is like a ""winner-take-all"" system. In the Electoral College a presidental candidate must have trans-regional appeal.

To begin, there are run-off elections. Run-off elections will make sure that no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electorial College will help make it clearer to see which candidate is the winner. For an example in 1992 Clinton had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, then won a majority in the Electoral College.

Next, the Electoral College has a ""winner-take-all"" process. States such as Florida (29), Texas (38) and California (55) have a high amount of electoral votes. If there was a tie between two candidates and the votes from Florida were not put in yet, one of the candidates has a better chance of winning. Most candidates will try to persuade and win the higher states votes so that they will have a better chance of winninig. What's nice about the Electoral College, it causes the toss-up states to pay close attention the the campaign.

Finally, every candidate running for office must have a trans-regional appeal. None of the regions in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect the new president. When a canidate goes and campains in one region without thinking about he will not gain his electoral votes. Normally a candidate that has only regional appeal will be unlikely to be a successful president.

To conclude, the choice of keeping the Electoral College would very very wise and helpful. The Electoral College makes sure that there are run-off elections, it has a ""winner-take-all"" system, and that every canidadte running should be trans-regional. Even though in the Electoral College is not democratic and that only a slate of electors vote, a decent amount of times of when the people would pick that one candidate the electors would pick the same one.

1EF06A265A04,"""Boys and girls of every age, wouldn't you like to see something strange?"" After hundreds of years with the Electoral College working just fine, it would be very strange for Americans to just give it up in the name of convenience. The Electoral College should stay in place because our founding fathers created it, it keeps socialism and communism out, and it is in the constitution.

Our founding fathers did many things that would ensure the United States is in safe position for centuries to come. We have the freedom of speech, religion, press, to bear arms, and of privacy. These are just as important as the Electoral College. The founding fathers of the United States wanted to make sure Americans didn't vote for communist or socialist presidents by popular vote. So they created the Electoral College, a system of voting in which each state has a certain number of points based on the amount of Senators and Congressmen representing tha state. If a presidential candidate has a majority of votes in the state, the candidate wins all the points from the state. According to the first source, there is a current total of 538 points in America and it takes 270 for a candidate to win. There is not one thing the founding fathers did that harmed the United States; America should have faith in these men and not charismatic candidates who plan to go against the constitution.

Furthermore, the Electoral college keeps socialism and communism out of our capitalist democracy. Sometimes people don't fully understand politics and vote to simply make their voice count somehow. It may sound illogical, but everyone makes wrong decisions sometimes. The Electoral College is in place to keep people from falling into traps and voting for socialist candidates who plan to rid the U.S. of its freedom. According to the second source, Jimmy Carter, one of the worst presidents America has ever had, and Bob Dole, a prsidential candidate who lost to Bill Clinton, were in favor of getting rid of the Electoral College. If popular vote were in place, the one with the most votes overall wins. That would make it a popularity contest and anyone who has witnessed one of those in high school knows they never end well. America has not had a socialist president with the Electoral college; who is to say there will not be one without it?

Additionally, the Electoral College is written in the constitution. According to the first source, the Electoral College in the constitution and is briefly mentioned in the 23rd amendment, which allows District of Colombia to participate in the Electoral College and gives it 3 electors. Getting rid of a law, or in this case a system of voting, from the constitution is never a logical decision. For example, the 8th amendment,""no cruel and unusual punishment"", is not a wise choice to get rid of and nor is  the 2nd amendment ""the right to bear arms"". Why? Because it would turn America into something it isn't; it provides more government control over its citizens. Without the Electoral College, everyone's vote is seen and counted, even the independent ones and the votes of the elderly. The constitution is a guide for the people from those who fought and died for the country and it should never be altered for convinience.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should stay where it is because it was created by the founding fathers, it keeps communism and socialism out, and it is in the constitution. If the United States were to rely on anyone, it should be the founders of the country itself, for they were the ones who fought for the freedom of the country.

A47BE7BB6F08,"The Electoral college is a proccess that was established in the constitution by the founding fathers as a compromise between the votes in congress and popular vote of certified citizens that leads to how they select the president.

The Electoral college has electors who actually vote for the president  and these votes are counted by congress. The Electoral college holds 538 electors , but it is required the at least 270 electors must vote in order to elect a president.

where the people do have a chance to vote and their vote is seen as a popular vote , but it seems like the electors votes count more than the peoples.

The electoral college has been a way of electing our president for years , but there is one question . Do the peoples votes really matter?

In the electoral college there has been cases where the people voted for a president but yet the electors chose otherwise , so are they really representing our votes or are they just getting Americans to believe that their votes actually count?

Under the Electoral college system voters don't really vote for the president.

Voters are actually voting for the slate electors who in turn elect the president.

For example if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for the slate of the amount of democratic electors that are pledged to Kerry.

If they won the statewide election ,then they would go to congress and kerry would get the electoral votes from the amount of slate that Texas has.

The electoral college is not fair to the voters. This reason is because of their winner takes all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they feel they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the

""swing"" states , the states they feel they have a chance in or feel they have to win over. During the 2000 campaign , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all and the largest media didn't get to see a single  campaign ad. Candidates only visit states they feel are important to them which is considered unfair to the voters who actually vote for them.

The electoral college method  may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The fact that they feel their vote has no effect, they pay less attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. The people's votes should matter because it is our country these choies  affect. The electoral college method is discouraging some of the voters to vote.

Reason is that people only vote for a certain president based on not their support or ideas for america, but based on their looks.

Finally when the electors who elected the president and not the people, the citizens votes goes into a good cause. When they agree to a final vote then that candidate gets the job.

D3DB341F4932,"Dear Senator, i am not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I would much rather have the presidency based on the popular vote. With the Electoral College, voters aren't even voting for the presidential canidate, they are voting for a slate of voters. This slate of voters will then go put the number of electoral votes that the state has in. For example, in Florida, the voting slate is twenty-nine. So which ever canidate wins the popular vote in Florida, receives twenty-nine electoral votes. The popular vote method would take longer, because more votes would have to be counted and added, but I truely beleive it would be more effective.

In 2012, Obama received 61.7% of electoral votes but only 51.3% of popular. Either way he would have won, but the popular vote is more of what the actual citezens want. in 2000, Al Gore dominated the individual popular vote, but when the electoral votes were counted, Gore came up short with 266, wheras Bush had 271. So you can see that if the popular vote was what counted (as it should be), Gore would have won the election.

During the election campaign, some states may not even see the canidates. For example in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates. The reason behind this is because of ""swing states"". Canidates don't want to waste time in states that they have no chance of winning. Instead, they focus only on the tight runs in the ""swing states"". Voters in twenty-five of the largest media markets didn't see the first campaign ad during the whole election.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is over-rated, and somewhat inaccurate. The reason I say that it is somewhat inaccurate, is because the people are voting for the presidential canidate that they want to have in office. Instead, they are actually voting for votes.

You are told that you should go out and vote a president but your really voting for electors. when you go to vote you dont even get to see the elctors your voting for. This shouldent be allowed because the presidential canidates are the one running the camipaigns and publicity but we know nothing of the electors using the electoral collage to elect a president.

Also this form of voting is not practical because in the end the people werent the deciding factor because the electoral vote is such a large one

In conclusion the way that we elect our presidents needs to change. The popular vote is a way to insure that people are getting there say in who is president. If the people see somthing wrong with a presidental canidate the peole should be able to put a stop to that and not have the chance of being overuled.

I write this letter to you, our state senator, because, like many other U.S citizens or residents, I have my own opinion. I am in favor of the idea of changing to popular vote. Electoral College does not work, it is unfair to voters because a president with the highest popular vote could not win,and it could be ""disaster factor"". Many are familiar with this term: ""compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(What Is the Electoral College?,1), but how does it benefit us? Does it express our opinions and preferences?

Lets go back in time to the election of 2000, The candidate with the most popular votes was Gore, therefore, everyone was expecting him to win. The mayority was happy with the outcome until they counted the electoral votes, Bush had more electors on his side than Gore. Nobody understood why, they gave the country the president less wanted. Dispite the fact that it was the first time since 1888, (because it happened once and for sure it could happen again), Why did all those people voted if they got the president they didn't trust to rule their country? In History class, my teacher told us: ""This country's foundation is for the people to rule the government, in other places (like Italia, Argentina, Spain, etc.) the government takes care of the people, like it they were our parents."" I believe we stay true to the foundations and let the people choose the president they want.

""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system alloys for much worse""(Plumer,1). This quote is based on 1960,when people who favored separation based on race nearly Democratic electors were replaced with the ones who would oppose Kennedy. Many electors make a last minute change in their decision and they decide to go over to the other side and vote against theit original choice, the party's candidate. ""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors""(Posner,1).

Another reason why this system should be abolished is the winner-take-all system. The candidates do not spend time in the states in which they believe they have no chance of winning. States had not even seen the candidate and in some cases, they even haven't seen a poster. For example, Plumer says in a expert from ""Mother Jones"" that ""During the 2000 campaing , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and Soth California, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a dingle campaign add."" The Electoral College system is unfair to the voters.

Overall, My beliefs (and the beliefs of hundreds) is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters because it can be the cause of some major disaster and it can choose the candidate the public is not haoory with. The votes are people who want to express, or show, political preferences, people who are determines to change their country for good, so give them the right to do it.

97CEADB02AE6,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to you today to talk to you about keeping the Electoral College instead of changing to the popular vote. Their would be derastic changes if we switch.

First of all, the president and vice presidents election is held every four years which means that every four years the goverment needs to pay for all these polls for the Electoral College and the popular vote. Yes, I see that if we switch to the popular vote it would save money and you would not need to even include the electoral colledge anymore but, a counter of that is if a recount is called upon the our voting citizens then they need to go vote again and the govermeant needs to pay for all these polls. I am guessing that Electoral Colleges are alot cheaper to put together and easier. To keep the Electoral College would be cheaper in the long run.

Also getting all those American voting citizens to vote again,well thats another story. In many of the cases I have seen is that people want to do the least amount of work they have to do and making them go vote again that involves quite alot of work actually. Lines for polls can be out the door in some cases and most people are not that in to goverment in the first place. People are just flat out lazy Mr. Senator.

I also would not be very happy if the goverment had to do a recount on the popular vote. I for one dont want to have to go back up to the poll booths. That would be a insult to me if I had to do it all again because I have already broadcasted my opinion to the goverment once already. I for one dont want to have to do it again and I dont think anyone would want to. Hell,you may even start a rade or protesters,you never know intill you try. But be honest would you want to risk that. The Electoral College almost would never need to have a recount because of the small numbers considering how big Americas population plus, like I said before, it would be consideribly cheaper than the popular vote.

So their it is Mr. Senator do you want to start a state wide rade or have protestors at your door steps,do you want to have to get up and inconvinence your self because the goverment of America is now wanting a recount of the popular vote. I didnt think so. So now I hope you can make the right desicion here and stick with the Electoral College.

Thank you for the time you spent reading this and I hope it changed your mind or even strengthened your views.

You can help choose your state's electors when you vote for President, when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors.

The best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for pickng electors and could always defy the will of people. Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. At some type of level, the electoral college is unfair to some voters. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of some swing voters in Ohio, they'll have to yet make it.

The electoral college is outdated, irrational, unfair, and its official. Best arguments in favor of mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The electoral college is regarded as an anachronism. Anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not to fit in the present. Advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not a democratic in a modern sense, its the electors who elect the president, not us (people).

There is pressure for run-off elections when there's no candidate that can win majority of the votes cast. No voters vote a nation election, also in that order about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election. The popular vote was in Florida. Other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than some other small states do. Almost some of the voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on a average type of level, and most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

There are five reasons for retainng the Electoral College, despite of it's lack of democratic pedigree. Pedigree is the origin and history of something, when it is good or impressive. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that some of the large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment of the Senate. The Electoral College avoid problems of elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes. Sometimes it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a type of candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Some voters in presidential elections are people that want to express a political preference rather then people who's thinking a single vote may decide on an election.                    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think we should keep the Electoral College. Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding father established it in the Constitution as a compromise between elections ot the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting for the electors wherer they vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College for five reasons. Number one,

Certainty of Outcome . Which is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Number two,

Everyone's president . Which is the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Number three,

Swing States . The Swing States is a winner-takes-all method of awarding electoral votes incluces the canidates. Number four,

Big States . The Big States is the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the politcal balance that the large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Last but not least is number five,

Avoid Run-Off Elections . Avoiding Run-Off Elections is when the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Elecoral College is not all that fair though because it is an anachronism, a non-democtratic method of selecting a president the ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

I think we should keep the Electoral College. Even though it is despised method of choosing our nation leader, it is the best form of desiding who will run and the winner. But it is the way our founding fathers made this nation and wanted it to stay that way because they created it that way.

B4B830162C24,"Dear state senator of Florida,

I'm sending you this letter for one purpose only, to convince you with strong defensive facts the electoral college is unfair, outdated, irrational and should be replaced with the popular vote. Let's begin with the simple fact that we, the common people of the United States of America, land of the free, don't even have the right to directly vote for a human being that is to be running our country for the next 4 years, possibly 8. Instead, we are voting for electors in the same political party as the candidate we wish for? Actually no, we don't even obtain that right because as stated in source 1 electors sometimes aren't even chosen by politcal party considering ""state laws vary on how electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...""

In source 2 it states that an elector can be anyone not holding a public office. The elector chosen is a complete stranger to more than half of the population of the state yet we are expected to trust that this person will live up to his or her word that he/she will vote for the president we want to be running this country when we have absolutely no control over their actions election day. Trust isn't easily given especially when there are no laws given that the elector must only vote from the candidate majorly favored in that particular state. So lets see the elector that we vote for, which in some cases people even get confused and vote for the elector of  opposing team, can walk in election day, decieve all the people from his/her state and walk out with absolutely no penalty.

In source 3 it later states that ""voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attenten to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election"" but what about the swing states? Because the winner-take-all system candidates don't even go to those states knowing that they'll most likely lose. Does that seem fair to you? That basically means that winner candidate could be the same man/woman that couldn't careless if their votes were on them or not.

Furthermore, in source 3 it explains how the electoral vote is the only way to ensure a certain outcome but as said in source 2, a tie may seem unlikely but highly possible. So let's say there is a tie, the winning decision then passes down to the House of Representatives. Here the state delegations cast one vote for the candidate they wish for but in the light of truth it is impossible for one representative of millions of people to be able to reflect on what the people want. So now what? Not only is plan A, the electors, totally bogus but plan B,which is the house representatives, completely takes our right to chose the citizen we want to represent the United States.

I hope you read my letter and come to realization that the electoral college is basically just a dirty method that's taking the rights of the common people. If it keeps on there will be one election year where more than half the population will open their eyes to fact that they don't even have a say in who they want to be running this country and simply not vote, then where will that lead us? Dictatorship? Rebellion? Popular vote is the way to go. It for one allows citizens to be apart of descision making in who should be president which later on abolishes the whole dispute over ""swing states"" and ""toss-up states"" because candidates will have to work twice as hard to earn their seat in the big house. Candidates will have to visit each state, anwser necessary questions from the citizen, compaign harder and at the end of the day a hard-working candidate will become a  hard-working president who will lead our country to prosperity.

After the electon there is a Certificate of Ascertainment perpared by the governor listing all of the canidates who ran for President along with the hname sod their electors.

Althoe there are some reasons why the Electoral college should change. Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy. So them electors in the same vein they qould have to occasionally refuse to vote for the partys cannidate and cast a decideiing vote to who ever they please.

CD7C4D073EC0,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to Complain about the electoral college. It is not a good and reliable way to elect a president. The desicion needs to be up to us, not the electors. It needs a change, badly.

For starters, the electoral college is small. It says in the passage, ""What is the electoral college?"", that ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors"". Now, its no rocket science to me, but that is nothing compared to the Billion people that live in this country. Now, i know that some might say that even though we have the right to vote at the age of 18, not every one votes. And, as that is true, i can tell you for a fact that more than 538  citezens of America vote every year. That is the problem for the electoral college.

Now, if that isn't convincing enough, just know that in the passage, ""The Indefensable electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it says that over 60 porcent of voters would rather have a direct election instead of the kind we have now.  And, it says that the voters are not even voting for a president, but instead, voting for a slate of electors to vote for a president.

Another reason that the elecotral college should be disposed of is that it can turn off voters whose state is already set on Democrat or Republican, and  have no desire to vote due to the fact that thier vote may not matter, as it says in the last paragraph of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our Despised method of choosing a president"". That is wrong because every one's vote needs to count, wether it makes a difference in the end or not.

So, Senator, I hope you understand where i am coming from on this,  and that something can be done. Thank you for your time. Good-Bye.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

C25D94FCB2F6,"Our country was built on the idea of giving people an influential chance on our government. The votes that matter in the Presidential election should be the popular vote of the people because the Electoral college votes are counted and not the people, and the country was formed for the thought of equal rights among the people.

The Electoral College is made up of electors, who are chosen by different ways per state. This means the electors are the ones voting and not the people. The people's vote goes to these Electoral Colleges, where the electors choose what candidate they want to vote for. The person the electors send their vote to may not be what the people chose. In the excerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong,"" it is stated that ""under the elctoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" That said, the people vote for the electors , not the president. Also stated in this excerpt is the fact of the ""disaster factor."" This is the possibility that the electors chosen could ""defy the will of the people.""

This county has a reputation of being one of the most free countries in the world. It was founded to show each citizen living in it the same rights, no more or less than another person. That said, each state should have the right to vote for which candidate they choose in any kind of election. This means the vote of the people should determine which president is elected. The fact of the Electoral Colleges goes against this idea. Each state has it's own number of Electoral College votes. These votes are set determined as one per elector. The way the government determines how many electors a state has is by seeing how many members of Congress the state has. The number of members of the House that the state has, plus two for the Senators equals how many electoral votes a state gets. In the excerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" there is a map of the United states' 48 continental states, and two seperate boxes for Alaska and Hawaii. Each state on this map has a number inside. These numbers represent how many Electoral College electors the corresponding state gets. This proves how unfair the idea of Electoral College is. Take California for example. California has 55 Electoral College votes. Now look at states like Alaska and Montana. Only three electoral votes are given to these states. Compare the populations between California and Wyoming. Even though there is a 45 electoral vote difference between these two states, it's not as big as Wyoming's 500,000 people versus California's 35 million. Not only that, the electors can choose whatever candidate in the running they want, and that's the problem with the Electoral College. Not all electors will vote for the candidate the citizens want. The vote for President isn't really up to the people, now is it?

The Electoral College idea should be eliminated because the electors' votes are counted and are not biased to the people, and because the Electoral College can be described as ""unconstitutional."" The idea should be changed so that the people have a bigger impact on the Presidental decision. This way, America can live up to it's reputation.

D3A5DD5DB33C,"Eletoral College would be better than the popular votes and I will be telling you about how in the next few paragraphs. Technically speaking electoral college is a popular vote, but in a different way. We vote for the electors. So that would mean the majority of the population have to still vote. Wouldn't you rather have a well thought out person than some one that isn't that smart or well thought out. Some one that could make a better decision for you.

Voters can still vote just not for the president. You would be voting for the electors who will then elect the president. Voting for a certain elector you could still be voting for the president you want. The popular votes can be tied together, many of the votes before were so close to being tied, and that would be a wreck. Could you imagine what would happen to the people. They would go crazy. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't ever happen. Having an electoral college could cause some dispute, but not as much as the popular vote has already caused. So many arguments and with an electoral college not many would have to deal with those disputes.

The electoral college requires a presedintial canidate to have a trans-regional appeal. So that means no one president can win because of a regional favriote. I mean who would want a president that would most likely favor a certain region because they voted for him. They would feel like he wasn't even their president or they had no say in votes. A president with only regional appeal would most likely not be a good president.

The electoral college makes sure that the electors will pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they decide the election. So the electors will be more thoughtful than some people in the popular vote. The electors can make a better decisions than most of us can. They would be able to make the decisons better and listen to the candidates more than we ever could.

Yes in some ways the popular vote can be good, but think of all the people that make the wrong decisions. The ones that would just vote for how the candidate looks. Not the thoughts and campains he brings. So in many more ways the Electoral college is better than the popular vote.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I am writing to you from the villages charter school in The Villages Florida. I am concerned with the way electing the president is done. I feel that the way it is done is not only unfair but illogical.

To begin with, I feel that the way the president is elected is not a fair way. I feel this way because a state can not controll how big or small it is, therefore giving it a small number of electoral votes lowers the importance of your vote If you live in a small place like rhode island, this makes people less interested in voting. If a president goes to his home state he usually gets the votes from there. so if a president was from texas then he will already be going on a great start.

If popular vote was used instead of electoral vote the voting system wold make people not only want to vote more but to know that it realy counts for a reason.

there are many things wrong with the electoral college, however one main issue is when there is a tie, when there is a tie in the electoral college votes the descion is then pushed to the house of representatives, and the vice president is chosen by the senator. this is a huge flaw because of how mant replublicans are in the house. this makes it unfair for a democratic representer get the job.

In conclusion i feel that the way voting is done should be changed and made to poularnvote insteadof electoral college. Thank you.

The Electoral College makes voting useless. If we want our voices to be heard as free citizens of this country then we should have full power over the votes. We are the people of America and we deserve to decide who takes the presidency. This country is our home and important to us and we deserve to be heard. I understnad that the Electoral College makes the whole voting process a whole lot easier, but it's not about easy. It's about our freedom and our freedom of speech.

The Electoral College is a system that selects electors to stand in place of us, but we the people aren't getting what we deserve. For example, if Florida has 29 electors and most of the state is voting for Romney, then those 29 electoral votes go to Romney. But suppose a smaller, less popular state like Wyoming only has 3 electors and most of the state votes for Obama; he only recieves 3 electoral votes. Now tell me, is that fair? Is it really?

Our purpose in the voting polls is disapperaing and now these candidates only count on the states that have the most electoral votes because they will count for more during the election. Candidates go around trying to win over the states with many electors and tend to ignore the ones with less. Even going as far as not advertising their campaigns.

The Elctoral College also gives the candidates a second chance at winning the election. Although someone won the popular vote portion of the election, they [the canidate] could still lose the election at the electoral portion. The electoral portion of the election is where the elected representatives go and vote for the president again and have a final deciding vote.

Electoral College was a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I am writing to the state senator of florida to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I am certain that we should keep the eletoral college because of three simple reasons. The Electoral College is a way of certainty of outcome. Swing states, and to Aviod run-off elections.

To commence I say the system of electoral college should stay because it has a certaint of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. This has happened before in 2000. In 2012 election, for Obama he received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. electoral votes arenon a winner-takes-all basis. A tie in the nationwide electora vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number.

To continue the second reason why I think th electoral votes should stay is becasue of sing states. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Last but not least electoral voting should stay because to aviod run-off elections. The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes.

To briefly wrap up I argue in favor for the Electoral Votes to stay because of the certainty of outcome, swing states, and lastly to aviod run-off elections. In some people's opinion's they would disagree, but they will not have enough facts to support why they disagree, because honestly Electoral Votes is always the way to go.              ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I beleive that you should consider voting against the electoral college. Now you may ask why, but, I assure you that the electoral college is a way for corrupt presidential candidates to win the office and make this great nation a horrible place. To back up my reasoning here are 3 reasons as to why you should consider voting against the electoral college. Segregationists replacing voters of one canidate for another, the election could become a catastrophe if a tie were to happen, there is a chance of a ""disaster factor"" happening.

In 1960 segregationists in Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose J.F.K. (Source 2, Bradford Plumer, The indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, P. 11, line 44) Imagine if the corrupters had been able to corrupt the election, we might have had a fiasco bigger than the 2000 presidential fiasco. If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the sytem works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart. Who do you think would win if those 2 people were to run for President? Not the one who should.

Some people claim an electoral tie is impossible, but, in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, if that doesn't seem so bad lets take a look  at how many people are in the United States alone. In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 from Hawaii had voted the other way. (Plumer, P. 12, line 80) The election is really only a few swing voters away from catastrophe, and possibly, the worst government shutdown these United States have ever seen. So, if 41,971 voters from 1968 didn't seem like alot, then lets look at the 9,246 voters from 1976, ties are seemingly getting closer and closer, what will happen when it is too late?

There is  always the off chance of a ""disaster factor"" occuring, like the one in the 2000 Al Gore VS. Bush Presidential election. Imagine if that were to happen again, only, this time, we put a blood thirsty, war hungry, nuclear savage into office. Imagine the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from 2000-present and then imagine them being fought on our own soil, imagine, instead of little Iragi children fighting against an invading force, your children fighting against an invading force, and that is just one of the minor things that could happen. Imagine if we put a man in office who thought the way to answer everything was through nuclear war, imagine what would happen to the United States. These are just a few examples of what could happen if another ""disaster factor"" were to happen again.

These are the 3 reasons as to why i beleive you should consider voting against using the electoral college. Imagine if We the People actually got to vote OUR favorite president into office on OUR own terms instead of some idiots a political party throws together, imagine how much better off we would be than we are now.

The Electoral College should be removed from our way of voting; we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because state senators are voting for our president and not us . As stated by Mr. Bradford Plumer in his article ""

The Indefensive Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong

"".

"" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of elcetors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to cote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide elcetion, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.""

This claim tells how the president is choosen and its not by our votes its by the slate of electors votes.

Also,the Electoral College should be removed from our way of voting; we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States because the electoral college is a disaster waiting to happen. Mr. Bradford Plumer states in his ""

The Indefensive Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong.""

""

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.""

The importance of this quote is because it tells us that there could be more disasters to come from the Electoral College.

The Electoral College should stay our way of voting because with it we avoid run-off elections. Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article ""

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""

that we avoid run-off elections. ""

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner....""

The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner.

Also, the Electoral College should stay our way of voting because of majority vote. The Office of the Federal Register states in their article ""

What is the Electoral College?""

in the third paragraph. ""

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House od Representatives plus two for your Senators....""

This quote shows how each state has so many electors.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is both good and bad for our voting system. Some systems are wrong and some are right but its a hard decision to make with the Electoral College because its both wrong and right. We dont need no disasters in the voting system we already have enough disaters in the world that we live in.                                          ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think that you should change teh Electoral College because it isnt really fare to our state trhat congress gets to pick our president. we as a state shoul get to chose on who we want to run our country, and who we want to be our leader. we should not have to pick the electors, why can we be the electors ourselves?

Some people might want there to be and Electoral College but what about the others who think that we should vote or the president and not for the election of a president by a vote in congress? 60% of the voters would prefer to direct election to th ekind we ahve know. We have to think about everyone in this case not just the ones that think the have control over everything. we should listen to everyones opinions, not saying you have to do what they say,but just listen to.

back in 1960, segregation in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy. In 1968, a shift of just 41971 votes would have deadlocked the election.

DA1CF518EC5A,"Dear State Senator,

I am here to inform you that you should change election to a popular vote for the president of the United States. This is due to the fact that as of now Americans vote to elect their president, but what good is that if they don't even recieve what they want? What is even the point of voting? Saying this, I agree with source two on its point, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This is backed up with data from the same article stating that voters can't even control whom their electors vote for. This is clearly why ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Without a doubt if you cared for your people, the people who support you and give you your job opportunity, you would see that you should abolish this electoral college. Even a blind man could see that.

You may be wondering if your people think this is such a bad idea, why would our founding fathers impliment something so horindess? As you see ""electoral college was established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"", says source 1. Although that sounded great at the time, today electoral college is frowned upon because majorly because of its ""winnr-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. As if that wasn't unfair enough, the electors don't even necessarily have to vote for their states choice. This would be similar to if I was infatuated with a color, I then asked my team what our team color should be and after taking a vote, I chose the color I preferred because I was bias even though my whole team disliked it. This is obviously the wrong way to run our election ecspecially the most important in our country.

On the other hand I do understand that there are some advantages to an electoral college. These include, mentioned in source 3, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaignthan a small state does. This is fair because there are more people in big states then small therefore big states should get more of a voice. Although in popular vote big states would still get the bigger vote because there are more people voting therefore they have more votes. This is why I think the middle man should just be cut out leaving us with a popular vote.

According to the facts it is clear to me that the electoral college should be siezed. I think it is unnecessary as well as unfair. When we think of voting for our president, that is what we want to do. Voting for our president does not include voting for someone who may or may not choose our choice. Also if we chose our President by popular vote all the votes that weren't majority would add up and possibly make the difference between the vote results. This is why it is unfair to simply use majority rule for each state and practically erase the other votes off the table. As you can see State Senator your people vote to elect their ruler. Why deny them of this oppurtunity. It is clear to me that the electoral college may have been a good concept to our founding father but when applyed is not the best decision. This is why I think you should change to an election by popular vote for president of the United States.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5C8E678EACDD,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I think that we should keep the electoral college. It provides winner take all method, it avoids run-off elections, and there is a certainty of outcome. I feel that the electoral college is not anachorism because it belongs in the present to.

First of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method. The winner take all method is getting a swing state. A swing state is good to win because people in toss up states pay close attention to the election. They actually listen  to the canidtes and what they are speking about. They are known to be the most thoughtful voters on average.

Secondly the electoral college should stay because it avoids run off elections. The electoral college makes sure that no canidate recieves a maajority of the votes cast. If no one wins a majority of the votes cast then it would add pressure to the election because it would greatly complicate the presidential election which is reduced by the electoral college. If it wasnt for the electoral college then half of the people like democrats of texas and republicans in california wouldnt vote because their votes dont count.

Third of all the electoral college should stay because it provides a certainty of outcome. A dispute over an outcome is possible but not certain that you would win. But on the other hand a dispute over the popular vote is more likely to win. The reason for that is that a winning canidates share of electoral votes exceeds his share of popular votes. A tie is possible due to the total number of votes being 538 but it is very unlikely.

In conclusion I think that the electoral college should stay because it provides a winner take all method, it avoids run off elections, and it provides a certainty of outcome. I hope that the electoral college stays in the election process forever.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
7FC4FC442AE9,"Dear Senator, The Electoral College as controversial as it is can be a very simple choice to either keep it as it is, or to change the voting process to a popular vote process that in which the people vote directly for the President of their choosing. I believe that you should consider changing the Electoral College to a Popular vote voting process for reasons such as, the fact that only ""one half of Americans are voting"" because they do not believe that their vote will count in states such as California and Texas because the voters do not believe that the candidate will carry their state anywhere(In Defense of the Electoral College section 23). Another reason is because of the winner-take-all system the candidates will not campaign as much in states they think they will win over without going there and they focus on the ""swing states"" instead.

Senator, one of the reasons that I believe you should consider changing to the Popular Vote process is because ""only one half of the eligible American population voted in the 2012 election""(In Defense of the Electoral College section 23) for reasons I believe is that they do not think that the candidate running will go somewhere with their state and the fact that they do not think their votes will actually count towards the President that they would like to win. Also the fact that segreagationists will try and corrupt the voting process in the Electoral College, i. e. When John F. Kennedy was running for President segregationists tried to replace Democratic Electors with other electors to try and go against Kennedy therefore giving the opponent the upper hand(The Indefensible Electoral College Section 11).

Senator, on the contrary I would understand why you would like to keep the Electoral College because of it being a set compromise that the founding fathers created, making voting equal by letting ""qualified citizens in congress"" have the last word into the decision (What is the Electoral College Section 1). In a way I see how you would think that the Electoral College is a fair system because the people are still choosing somewhat who the Electoral College elects and the fact that anachronism is a factor that plays into the Electoral College greatly(In Defense of the Electoral College Section 15). The Electors elected should be trusted truthful people and they are to vote for the nominee in honest fact of who got the most eelectoral votes(In Defense of the Electoral College Section 16) but sometimes even if the electoral votes are calculated and are higher the popular vote could be higher than the electoral vote even if its a rare occurance(In Defense of the Electoral College Section 16).

Senator, as you see both sides of this controversy you could also see that the Winner-take-all method is all in all unfair. In the winner-take-all method the candidates that are in the election will take more time to go to the bigger states and try and have ads for their campaign posted in there and not in the littler states they believe they will win without campaigning there. The candidates will focus even more on the ""swing states"" because they believe they will have more luck in those states than the other smaller states. ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad""(What is wrong with the Electoral College Section 13) this fact goes to show that the candidates would rather focus more on the larger states and ""swing states"" than go to the smaller states; this makes those smaller states less encouraged to vote because the candidates don't even bother to come to them to campaign.

Senator, in the end I strongly believe that you should think about changing the Electoral College to a Popular Vote process because it will give the voters an incentive for them to vote, for them to decide who wins and who will run their state or country. Power to the People has always been a great thought to keep running around in your brain for me. Before you discard my thoughts in a mere second think about it; would you like the people of your state to be unhappy with you and disappointed because they had no choice in what is happening around them? or would you like the people to be excited for the new changes in allowing them some freedom of choosing what they want and not what others want?                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
4D6E66600705,"Dear State Senator,

There is arising conflict on whether or no to abolish the electoral college system. It has it's pros and its cons but reasonablly, the cons out-do the pros. The electoral college needs to be taken over by popular vote in Presidential elections. It creates a more biased vote in the sense that the electors vote may oppose yours. On another note, the disaster factor is a negative factor of the electoral college.

First, in the electoral college, you will never be 100% that your states' electors will vote in your favor. By doing a popular vote, voters will be ensured that their vote is literally counting towards the candidate. For example, If you lived in Florida and wanted to vote for Mitt Romney, you'd vote for him. The electors may vote for Obama and just ignored the winner-take-all strategy and vote for Obama. In a sense, the electors may pay attention to the winner-take-all strategy. The problem is that in past elections, the popular vote has had majority and the electors vote for the minority.

Secondly, a flaw of the electoral college is the disaster factor. It is pretty much when a majority votes for a candidate and the electors give the minority vote. If the popular vote was to occur, then the candidate the majority wanted would've got elected.

To conclude, the electoral system should be removed because it is biased and popular vote will be more ensuring and 100% true. On my behalf, popular vote will be much better for everyone .

2007A7232687,"The Eletoral College should stay because this has been the system that has been used for years in the united states and i dont think that it would be respectful to the ones that have been choosen by this system. Most of the people who dont like this system of voting will most likely say that we the people dont really know any thing about who we are voting and that most of us who are voting for someone are just voting for them just because we have heard good thinds about them. I'm not going to lie and say that none of the people who do get to vote are all voting because they know their stuff about the candidates, but some of us who do know about the candidates and how they are working should not lose the right to vote for who ever we would like. If we dont get to vote for who we like and believe is better then what type of country are we.

If all of the states would have same electoral vote then things would be harder because we mostly at some point will have a tie this would cause major problems but since every state has a different number it is not likely that both candidates will end up with the same number of votes. Another reason people dont like this system is because most states have a winner takes all system where they dont spilt up the elector votes if most of the votes are for one candidate then he will get all of the votes from that state. This causes lots of people to rage on the Electoral college because they feel that the state is taking there right to vote and to be different.

The other good thing about Eletoral college is that no certain region can win a election so this makes candidates campaign in states that they no they can win. This also is something that people do not like because for example when the canidates were Obama and Romney and lets say he put alot of his campaigns in new york this would cause the new yorkers who are going with Obama to get mad and start to protest because they arent see anything from Obama so they might turn to the next candidate. This actually helps because when people favor someone this makes it even harder for a tie to happen in the election.

Many of the people who are going agaist say that we are not voting for a president that we are voting for a slate of electors. This is true but if we are voting for electors that are going to vote for the president that we would like its  just like voting for the president there is not difference. Some people who are going agaist Elector college use this to trick people and make them go agaist it but if you know about Elector College this wont happen.

Elector College should not be taken away in any matter because this is the easiest, best, and oldest way that we have of picking the new leaders for our country.                                       ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
41395A333EE6,"The United States has been known for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but that's not all. It's also known for the different freedoms made available and its fair government. The electoral college is a system in which states choose representatives to vote on the president. In the past, there was a big debate on whether or not this process was fair. The electoral college is not fair or trustworthy for many reasons.

Imagine that you picked a representative who said they were going to vote for the person you wanted for president. Sadly, they ended up changing their mind. You could end up with a president you don't like or believe in. Voters don't have total control over who their electors vote for. To me, that doesn't sound very fair. If everyone were allowed to vote, the people would be able to ensure that there vote counted towards the person they wanted, and not towards the candidate they were against. Based on multiple polls, a few presidents have won the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote. That means that the candidate which was chosen by the people did not become president. Our founding fathers fought hard for our rights, and it's our right to a fair vote.

There are more problems than just an unfair vote. It almost sounds impossible that there could be a tie in a presidential election, but it has almost happened before. In the past, votes have been so close that only a couple thousand have seperated the victor from the loser. What would happen if the votes came out to be tied in an election? Who would become president? I'm sure some people could argue that the electoral college could fix this problem, but I don't believe it could. Since there are less people making the descision during the electoral college process, it is even more likely that there could be a tie. If one person were to vote another way, it could be the equivalent of 1,000 people voting the other way. Also, during the electoral college the electors recieve rewards if their candidate wins. The people in that state, or even the whole country supported the electors and helped them make their descision, so they deserve recognition too.

The electoral college is not a fair or trustworthy process. Americans have no control over which candidate their electors choose to vote for. Also, there is a better chance for a catastrophic tie. America is all about being fair and giving people the opportunities they deserve. So, let's give Americans the chance for a fair vote. z         ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The system protects us from people accidentaly picking a leader that may end up being a tyrent or worse. Many people may say ""What about Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, or bob Dole."" Well it's vary likely that there will be more people like that if we change the system and start a new.

Even though, citizens of the USA think that the Electoral Collage is Anachronism. That statement is not true. If the Electoral collage was outdated the U.S. would the government system would have fallen awhile ago. even if there may be ties between the Electoral collage the system will have a plan B. While I'm Electoral collages the representives of the state are chosen by the people if the wrong disison was made people should balm the people who chose that person.

Another reason is some of the people think that their votes dont count and the reason that they dont vote is because they dont think the precent will move up if they vote so most people dont vote but all they can do is at least try. Electoral Collage also helps you see how many people are actually voting for each person to be the president.

You should keep Electoral Collage is because i think the people who want to vote should have the right to vote. I dont think people could get to tell you who you can and cant vote for. I think if you are eight-teen years or older you should have the right to vote and no body has the right to tell you that you cant vote for a certain person just because they dont like that person.

Another reason you should vote is because if nobody votes they cant elect a president. The reason why most people dont vote is because they think that their votes dont matter. They think when the vote or when their whole family votes the percent will go up they just think they are wasting their own time. Their votes count just because it dosnt go up one percent when they vote doesnt mean that their vote doesnt count.

My final reason why we should keep Electoral Collage is because you can see the number of Electoral votes out of each state. Do the people docide to not vote for the U.S. president? Or do they just not care what the world is going to be like when the new president come do you like that they just dont vote for a reason or just because they dont think it is important. For an example alot of the states only have three votes. California has fifty-five votes in just that one state. California has the most votes in the whole U.S.

In conclusion, I think we should keep the Electoral Collage because you should let the people who want the vote have the right because you dont know if they change it if they will still have the rules that they have for the Electoral Collage. Another reason you should keep it so you can show people that their votes actually count and people know which president they should vote for by looking at the percentage of each president going up for election. The last reason is because they can see how many people are voting in each state and you can see if you are one of those people because if the state says that there was zero votes ina state and you know that you voted you would be able to tell if your vote counted or not most of the time it does.                      ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

It is highly unlikely that you will read this, but hey it is worth a shot. There are many reasons as to why the Electoral College process should be used to elect the president of the United States and many reasons as to why the popular vote process should be used. For this same purpose, there is a controversy as to which process should be used. If I had a say into which should be used and which should not be used, I would rule in the favor of the popular vote process and not in the favor of the Electoral College process.

The first reason as to why I would be in favor of the popular vote process is that in the Electoral College process, big states are being more effective than small states. This might lead the small states to not vote because they feeel that they would not make a difference. Source #3 claim the following, "" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...."" When bigger states have more electoral votes, the candidates will be lead to thinking that if they get the bigger states, for example California who gets 55 electoral votes, to be in their favor then they might have a bigger chance at winning which will have the small states, like Hawaii who only gets 3 electoral votes, thinking that they have no say as to who gets to be their president. This claim is supported by source #3 when it is stated, ""  Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"".

The second reason as to why I am not in the favor of the Electoral College process is because as said in source #3, "" Voter is toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that they are going to decide the election"". Candidates mostly pay attention to states that have more electoral votes, this causes them to pay more attention to the bigger states and leave out the smaller ones, as already argued, some states get more electoral votes than others. Another reason why this is bad is because most states will not pay attention in the election because they will not make a difference. If popular vote were to be in action, then more people and citizens will pay attention because it will be a more interesting election since more epeople have a say and the candidates will pay attention to all states. Even the bigger states with more electoral votes know that they are the ones to basically decide the election.

The popular vote process is more effective and fair for the United States in choosing the President. Most people can argue in that favor as well. If you qwant the elections to be fair, I supposwe that you will pay attention to the voice of thousands of citizens and you will be fair.                         ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I belive that we should change the election to a popular vote for the president of the united states. We should have this for two reasons, one we should make the choice ourselfs so it matters more in the long run and two it will make more potental voters. We as americans should have more power when it comes to chooseing our president.

Some people may argue that the electorial college avoids the problem of run-off elections as stated in source two. I think if there is a tie then there should have the previouse presedent of the united states vote to brek the tie. I dont believe any vote should count more than a citizens vote. If we are suppose to have a goverment run by the people why cant the peoples vote matter.

I feel that people would vote more if their vote could be that single vote that decides who`s president. In the electorial college only their vote matters the popular vote doesn`t make a difference in the long run. The reason people vote is so that the person they want as president will win the race not so the person the electorial college wants to will win. The popular vote is simply deciding electors who can vote however they please which means the citizens vote doesnt make a difference wich unfair.

In conclusion america should have a popular vote not an electorial college because the peoples vote should matter.

Do we not owe it to ourselves, posterity, and country to fix all potental harms to our nation the presidency should not be taken lightly it is a grand position that gives power and fame to all who hold those who have it could maintain the country, grace the nation with new prosperity, or condem Americans to years of suffering, toil, and misery. As citizens we should not alow anyone but the most valid character obtain this place. Mistakes are not alowed! we should take it upon ourselves now to modify this method be for it is to late and avertid.

There is no mitake America must act fast and modify this method for the nation, for their children, and for themselves.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

6C5E3DA13C53,"Dear State Senator,

Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country; our President and Vice President.  We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights.  I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.

The Electoral College has major flaws.  Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions.  Source A in paragraph 12 states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.""  The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe.  It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly.  The other countries would take us as a joke; we would simply look like fools.  Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote.  Source B also in paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.""  And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR (House of Representatives), where state delegations vote on the president.  And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million.  That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70.  That is a tremendous difference in population.  Don't let our country plummit into bad election.  If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote.  With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right.  Source C says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.  Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the ""swing"" states.""  Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000.  Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina.  Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads.  Just as Source D states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.""  The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people.  What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress?  It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent.""  What if it happened again?  Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush?  Thank that to the electoral college.  In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266.  This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.  And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.  But why?

First of all, Source E states, ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does.""  But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair.  The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do.  This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play.  It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California.  Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, ""They are the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""  Once again, this statement is unfair.  This is favoritism.  This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more ""thoughtful"".  Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote.

People want to make their own decisions.  It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities; we want to feel important.  With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote.  So it's official.  The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.  And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.  Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason.  It's fair.  There's only one thing I have to say to you.  State Senator, please abolish the electoral college.

Sincerely,

And when we vote for your new president you are actually voting for the candidate's electors.

In maine and nebraska they are differnet form every other state they dont do the winner takes all they have a differnet system. When the president is elected he gets a certifacation of all the people he beat. I think thats wrong I think that everyone that fought in this election should get a little thing. Jimmy carter, bob dole, and others all agreed that electoral college should be abolished. In this election 60 percant of people voted not to have a electoral college.

When voters are voting on the new president they are actally voting for the state of electors. If your voting in texas for someone that is running you wouldn't be voting for them you would be voting for the democratic electors. The best argument against the electoral college would have to be the disaster factor. In 2000 there was a election crisis that broke out it was the biggest one. The states leislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors and picking this people they can defy eneyone.

Back in 1960 a louisiana legislature succeeded in replacing the democratic elector with a new one. Electors had refused to vote for their party's candidate and it happened in hawaii 1960.

It is also hard to understand and it can get confusing as well.

There is two different groups thay pick the president and vice-presidents. The people who pick the vice-president is The Senate. Each indivaule state only casts one vote.

Is it okay to say you will do something and then say ""hey I am going to change my mind after people vote becaise they like what I said?"" No it is nopt okay. If you say you are going to to do something and your state is counting on you, you need to keep you word and do what you said. Also, why is it the big states get more attention than the small states?

I feel as if we got rid of the electoral college it would just cause us more trouble that we are dealing with at the moment. the electoral college helps us so dramaticly, and some people just don't understand how much it really helps. Everyone might think they know so much about the electoral college, like if we got rif of it everything would just be fine. No one really knows what really goes on all the time. I could not  imagine if we were to ever et rid of the electoral college that has been there since our founding fathers.

If we we going to change the election to by a popular vote thngs would get out of hand and horrble things could happen. Large states as Texas, California, and Minnesota would have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. People not in those states would get angry and things would get bad. It takes 270 out of 538 to be elected president and if changing to popular vote for the election would be thelargest state elector would be the president.

Yes there are things that are wrong in the electoral coleege but nothing is perefect as we all know. In Texas if you wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry, and thats just one thing that is wrong. Another thing wrong about the electoral college is a tie in the electoral vote. If happened the election wouldbe thrown to the House of Representatives, where state dlegations vote on the president. Then the senate would then choose the vice-president. Because each state casts only ne vote, the single representive from Wyoming, representing 500,00 voters, would have as much as the 55 represenyives.

When youvote for a presidentiial canidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast.  Nixon and Clinton both had only a 43 percent chanceplurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college. There is pressure for run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably prodeuces a clear winner.

If the election changed to a popular vote things as we know it would change drasticly.                                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
9DF12143A699,"Dear, state senator

I am writing this letter to argue the favor of keeping the Electoral College during president elections. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. All are practial reasons , not liberal or conservative reasons.

Certainty of outcome

Everyone's President

Swing states

Big states

Avoid Run-Off Elections

Certainty of outcome

A problem over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. Once before it happened in 2000 , but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral college comes from his popular vote. 2012 election for example Obama & Romney , Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of popular votes. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes.

Everyone's President

Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. A president from the south ,has no incentive to campaign in those states, he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win in . This is a unfair result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to ba a successful president. Residents of the other regions are likely to feel as their votes do not count,that the new president has no regard for their interest.

Swing States

Winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign ,and to really listen to the competing candidates . They are known to be the most thoughtful voters. They have recieved the most information and attention from from the candidates.

Big States

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose. A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does

Avoid Run Off Elections

The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. A run off election is when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

Voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

There's also some cons of the Electoral College. In the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case , the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president. The electoral college is unfair to voters. Becasue the winner take all system in ecah state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , they focus on ""swing"" states. Votes vote not only for the president ,but for a state of electors , who in turn elect the president.

There's a lot of pro's and con's to this arguement,but I believe you should keep the Electoral College .                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

This is a fabulous and very plentiful country. We the people are grateful of our freedom and love our leaders. However, our system of choosing our leaders is not the best. The Electoral College is unreliable and not very accurate. We should vote by most popular choice among the citizens of America.

The electoral voting system is not very efficient because, mostly by this in my opinion, each state really has only 1 vote. A represenative worth 55 million people should not be equal to a represenative worth only 500,000 people. This system is very unbalanced and unfair to the American people. Canidates for the election only have to focus on certain states that they can swing in their favor and get most of the states votes, but they won't always be getting most of the peoples votes.

An election where each citizen counts as 1 vote and out of all those votes the majority wins. That is a more than fair system of voting, not some system where we vote for someone to vote for us. That's just flat out unethical, unfair, and unwanted.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I feel as if we, as Florida citizens should be able to change election by popular votes rather than Electoral College. I understand that The Electoral College is a process that consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President and so forth; but you don't understand how it is affecting the citizens. We are the people that vote! I am against the Electoral College process because it overrides popular vote, voters aren't really voting for president, and the process is unfair to voters.

To begin, I am against the Electoral College process because it overrides popular vote. For example, in 2000 when Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, he lost the presidency. The popular votes is what really counts because its the actual citizens voting not the electors. In contrast, The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought  to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College process is forgetting that the popular votes is what really matters.

Futhermore, I am against the Electoral College because voters aren't really voting for the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. The process isn't even trustworthy because the presidential candidates can elect themselves. Under the elecoral college process voters aren't voting for president but for the slate for electors.

Finally, I am against the Electoral College because its unfair to voters. For example, during the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the canidates at all. Canidates don't spend time in states they know they know the have no chance of winning. This is unfair because voters should know who they are voting for. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College should not be used because it overrides popular votes and voters aren't really voting for the president. Also because Electoral College is unfair to voters.

8FD1BE85C7AE,"Dear state senator,

I beleive that we should get rid of the electoral college. It is unfair to many voters. Because of the winner tak-all system in each state candidats dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focsing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not seee the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Caronlina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markes did not see a single campaign ad. we should also get rid of the electoral college because of the electoral college they lost 60 percent of the voters who would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidtate receives  majority of the votes casted. For example Nixon in 1968 and cliton in 1992 both had only a 43percent purality of the popular votes, While winning a majority in the Electoral College 301 and 370 ecetoral votes, there is pressure for run-off when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.

But back to electoral college votes being unfair a lot of the states like  wyoming north and south dakota knowing they only get three votes that count some people dont even bother voting, I mean I would not want to if i knew that my vote really was not going to make a diffrence.

so yes electoral college votes are good like how obama recived 61.7 percents of the votes out of the 51.3 percents that Romney got, because all states award the winner take-all system. But I think that we should go back to a direct election to make the voting fare to evryone to keep everyone voting and make them feel like we are still one country.         ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The United States Of America should change the voting of the president to popular vote. popular vote gets to see what the citizens of the United States want not just the 538 electors. They should change it to popular vote because it gets to see what the people want and we cant control who the electors vote for.

The president should be picked by the people because whoever wins the presidency is in charge of us. In the passage ""What is the electoral college"" it says ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors"". That means 538 people get a say in who they want the president to be not the many citizens. We all should get a vote because if the electors are the only ones who get to pick then the popular vote is useless.

Another reason why we shuold use only popular vote is because the electors dont always choose the president that their state wants. There only been a couple incidents of this happening but its possible.

C43D24F5A342,"Dear Senator,

I argue in favor to changing the election by popular vote for the president. I aruge this because we aren't even really vote for a president, we are jsut voting for people who pick the president for what the passage says.

In what's wrong with the electoral college , its says ""voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So this means we aren't even electing our own president, just people who do. which is not what everybody is thinking, everybody is thinking we are voting and we have that right and we have a say.

But in all reality do we really? We are just voting for people not the president and i think it should be changed. Then the passage goes on about if you vote for a certain people you've voted for a slate of how ever many people to vote for our president. Now to me that doesnt sound very right, it sounds like we are just voting for pretty much nothing. That we just get to vote for nothing and it doesn't even really matter what our vote is and they're going to pick who they want. I really thinkg it should be changed becuz reading this passage makes me kind of not even want to vote. Because i feel like its not helping any and i think that should be chamged and we shoukd have more of a right to vote for the president.

5F6C60DA60F6,"Dear Senator,

I believe we should change the electoral college. In my opinion the electoral college is unfair. To begin with it reduces the amount of voters because the voters believe they don't have a say in the election. As Richard A. Ponser said ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California.""In addition, we do not directly vote for the president, we vote for people who we believe will vote for the president. Also I don't think it is fair that if a candidate gets the majority vote he/she should recieve all of the votes from the state. I believe we should go to direct voting. Where we the people get to directly vote for the president and after the whole nation has voted we tally up the votes and see who got the most. This method would be best because people would prefer it more and it would make people believe they have a say in who becomes the president. In addition, it is better than the Electoral College because there is less room for errors and it will not be as unfair. In addition, it will make the candidates work harder to get votes and they will try to visit more of the states because if they know that if the majority of a state is democratic they believe they will easily win the votes from that state, but if it was direct voting they would go to these states to make sure they can get as many votes possible from it. Also another issue with the Electoral College is the picking of the electors. The picking of the electors could be bad because these electors could be bad people who get a lot of votes for one candidate but still pick the other one. To conclude I believe we should get rid of the Electoral College because it is an unfair voting system. Instead we should change to direct voting where every vote counts.

DB6025F937EA,"Dear Mr. Senator,

Today I am asking for your favor of keepig the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This process now consists of the selection of the electors and meeting where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of votes by the congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, but only 270 of those votes are required to elect the president. I think that we should change the way that our citizens vote. I also think that we should update how the elections are run.

First of all, we should change the way that our citizens vote. When we vote for a president we are actually just voting for that Elector. So there is a possibility that the Elector could vote for the opposite president and your vote basically not be put in. I think that our citizens should have enough rights that they dont have to have Elector to do the voting for them and we can all just vote for who we want. For instance, it could be just all politics and the Electors get paid to vote for a certain person and thats why most of the presidents who get elected get elected today.

Secondly, We should update how the voting system works. Instead of it being 270 people out of 538, we should just have everyone one vote without Electors. Then everyone would have there say in the voting system and then they could just average it out or figure out the math of who won by percentage. For instance, take the number of all the people who voted for both presidents and take the number of one of the presidents and divide them by eachother and multiply it times 100. Then all the political stuff wouldnt happen because everyones vote counted. Maybe a change in the system would be a good idea.

Last but not least, In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, Bradford said that in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that vote would not have actually gone to Kennedy. So the Electors are not as reliable as everyone thought. Some Electors have also refused to to vote for there parties canidate. My honest opinion is to just change the Electoral College.

In conclusion, I am writting to you Mr. Senator in hopes that you can fix the Electoral College and change the election to a popular vote. If this were to happen, it could make our citizens have a little more rights. We may also update our system a little bit so that the election voting is a little more accurate so that everyone gets to get there vote in. Maybe this could be what solves most of the political problems in the world.

Some say they would prefer popular votes rather than electoral votes, while others believe we should keep it the same way. I believe that it is more fair and less kayotic having popular votes rather than electoral votes. I believe that popular votes keep it fair when it comes to choosing a Presidant and does not cause a lot of fights. Although I believe this some say that electoral voting is also safe and keeps people under control.

Some United states citizens, including me, believe popular votes are more fair and are more of peoples choices. Lots of citizens believe that with electoral votes it's not fair because with electoral votes candidates don't spend time in all the states, some states don't even see campaign ads. Also it's fair because that means that lots of people truly want that candidate for Presidant. Just like when Al Gore won the popular votes, which mean more poeple like him and thought he would be a great President, lost the whole campaign cause of electoral votes. Citizens also get more say if it were for just popular votes and with elctoral votes not so much because even if their is a tie people don't choose, House of Representatives do.

As for others they are completly against popular votes and think that electoral votes are more safe and calming for many reasons. It keeps it fair because it isn't based off which candidate put more comersuals out there or who people know more. With electoral voting you are voting for the electors in The Electoral College who then vote themsevles and are then are counted by Congress. Also with electoral votes not lots of arguing could happen. With popular votes people may begin to argue about who deserved it more cause more peple knew him rather than the other candidate. ""Also it more fair because each state has their own group of electors so they know who is better for their state."" (source 1, paragraph 5)

Dear Senator

I heard recently that you might be taking away the electoral college.  If you dont know allready the electoral college is a process founded by our fuounding fathers in the constitution.  In the article ""In defence of the electoral college"" they say,""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.  so a solid regional favorite, such as romney was in the south, has no incentive to campagin heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pulralityin the states that he knows he will win.""  this keeps the election 'fair' and the canidates cant just pick a region and ""take over.""

I understand that when you use the Electoral college system you vote not for the president but for a slate.  allthought this is your still putting your vote towards a president.

In the article ""In defence of the electoral college""the electoral college restores some of the weight in the policital balance that the large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution.  The Electoral college keeps the votes balance in the states.  These are some reasons you should consider before you take away the Electoral college, and remember like source 3 say ""voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who thinkthat a single vote may decide an election.""

3178219EF1B3,"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I argue in favor of changing the Electoral college to election by popular vote for the presidents of the united states.

""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In this case, the election would be thrown to the house of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" (The senate would choose the vice president). Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. For example: If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for someone, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to him.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. ""And if anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it"". For example: In 2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only  51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

I dont like the way they did it, the senate suppose to vote not the people because some people just vote for a reason or to get a job. ""It's official; The electoral college is unfair ,outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis  in reality, and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."" The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough elestoral votes to elect a president.

""The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachromism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be Overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" It can be argued that the Electoral college mehod of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states- democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by populars vote.""            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
2DF86580B7E7,"Foremost, the electoral college is a process used for selecting a president through the popular vote of qualified respesenators. The electoral college was established by our founding fathers, and still benefits us today. Using trusted representatives and efficently casting the desired vote, the electoral college is the best method of selecting a president. The electoral college allows the country to be sure of an outcome, and no one region can elect a president on its own.

Electoral votes are cast by electors chosen to represent each state, these electors are ""...trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."", stated Richard Posner. This means that electors are trusted and qualified to efficiently represent the vote their state desires. The trust set upon electors is ""rarely betrayed"" Posner said. The last time an election was won by someone who didn't get the popular vote was in 2000, and this doesn't happen often. This is contrary to what was said by Bradford Plumer. Plumer stated ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.""

The electoral college gives America certainty of an outcome, without a tie, or a run-off election. The ability to rest easy knowing there will be a clear winner is an ability given to America, by the system of electoral votes.  A tie occurance in an election is ""Highly unlikely..."" Posner said. Even though most states use a ""Winner-take all"" basis, ties and run-off elections are still extremely rare and unlikely.

Swing states- a debated and popular issue amog the electoral college. Swing states are often paid more attention and given more information than regular states. While being paid more attention, the swing states together are able to determine the election's outcome. Though small states don't get much attention, they still have a say in the election.

50105417A5B7,"Dear,state senator

The Electoral College voting method is a very debated subject among the people. That is why I am here to explain to you my opinion on it, and why i think that the whole process needs to be stopped. As you can probably already tell, I completely dis like the whole process all together but anyway here is my letter to you.

The first issue with this process is that there is not that much stability to it. When people vote for who they want as president they're giving their votes to some one else just so the person they gave them to can vote for who they want to,not for the elector that that person actually put down on the ballet. We the people are not even the ones who technically get to pick who we want as president, it's the electors.

This being said brings me to my next point,what is the point of the people voting if we arent even the ones who get to pick the representatives? Yes, they say that when people are voting,they are actually voting for electors but what if the electors dont listen to the peoples votes and only vote for who they want? It is true that the slate of electors is trusted to vote for the parties person they want to elect but, there is always that tiny percentage that the electors can break that trust. When they take these chances they are setting themselves up for disaster.

I hope that you take what I said into consideration. These are just a few of the things that are wrong with the Electoral College system. Its only a matter of time before people like me start to realize everything wrong with the system we have now, and when they do realize the things wrong with it, they will want something done about it. Please help get a better system going and end this Electoral College crap we have now.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D97A2C636D38,"When you think of the USA  the first word that you think of is freedom or a word along those terms. I would have to agree with you we are a very free and fair country for...most things like voting I would have to say that the Electoral Collage is the one unfair thing we have and their are many reasons why we should replace the Electoral Collage with popular vote.

The Electoral Collage is when voting for the president, instead of dierectly voting you have electors represnt your state during elections. The Electoral Collage is made up of 538 electors, you have one elector for every member of the Congressional deleagtion and House of Representives plus two for the Sentors this is per state then they all come together to represnt during the election of the president. This is how the Electoral Collage is set up it all seems fair but you, yourself arent having a fair chance to vote for who you want as the president, its like haveing someone make your dessions for you its just unfair. The Electoral Collage is set up so the electors vote for who they want to win surely one of your electors will vote for who you want  but its not enough you basically have no voice during elections. Bradford Plumers The Indefsible Electoral Collage he says ""At the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters, because of the winner take all system in each state"" he then says "" The candidates only spend time in the swing states where they know they have a chance of winning""; he is pointing out that those who are running for president spend a mojortity of their time in the states where they can get the most amount of votes for example they might campain to Florida or Washington DC but not even go to a state like Wyoming or Idoh.

I think we should have the popular vote because it goves everyone a chance to vote for the president, they can voice their opions out loud and have a chance at seeing who they want in office. Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because the electors might all be Republican or all Democrat but we as voters dont get a chance to pick what party we stand for, with popular vote you have a chance to say who you want and what party you represent weather its Republican, Democrat or Induvial you at least get the chance and even though its only a 25 percent  chance who you vote for is going to win at least its still a chance. Popular vote has its many advantges but one of the best is you can ""get to know"" who your voting for the canidates can come to your state and make speechs, have posters something to tell you what they are planning on doing if they get elected, this gives every state a fair chance to see who they are voting for. And yes they might spend a longer time in New york then Ohio but at least their spending time and educating the people on what they want to do and why the people should vote for them. Know I know theres alot of arguments on why we should have the Electoral Collage so let me get to that.

In Richard A Posners In Defense of the Electoral Collage he states that the Electoral Collage is good because of the "" swing states"" wich he then says "" The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the most thoughtful voters because they know they are going to decide the election"" in saying this he means that people who live in swing states will be more careful and more thought out on who they want to vote for. Yes this might be true but what about all the non swing states like for example Texas they could have been careful while voting but Florida was not, then you have Ohio and New Mexico who could have been careful to but compared to Florida their votes get lost even though they were more careful and thoughtout.

So as you can see popular vote is more fair and also a smarter method of things it gives the peoplle a fair chance to vote for who they want while also allowing them to voice thier thoughts.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

While I understand that the Electoral College has worked sufficiently up until this point, it may not always work well enough to keep America sustained for the rest of its lifetime. The electoral college is unneccesarily complicated and the more steps you take heightens the chance of error. I acknowledge the fact that discrepencies in the current voting system are highly unlikely, but they have happened before and who says they won't happen again? I don't know why voting has to jump through so many hoops to make it count. It's indirect and the votes could be messed up at numerous different points. The Electoral College is an unjust form of democracy and it needs to be changed.

Under our voting system voters' votes do not actually count for the candidate that they voted for, rather a slate of electors who then vote for the candidates themselves. Having the slate of electors is like blanketing them: you can hear them and you know that they're there but you can't understand what they really want. Take the election of 2000 for an example. Al Gore had more votes among the people but Bush won the presidency because the Electoral College inaccurately represented the people. If America was truly a democracy, Al Gore would have been president because the people would have actually been heard. If the people could actually have a say in the way that America is run, most people would choose to abolish the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is unreliable. It could come to a tie in any election and then the House of Representatives would step in and make scales tip even further. Each state casts only one vote and I find that ridiculous. Why would each state only get one vote? I think that the states should get a proportionate number of votes to their population. There is no reason why 500,000 voters should be wieghed the same as 35,000,000 voters. The people voting do not get represented fairly whatsoever.

A direct democracy would be a better fit for America so there wouldn't be so many discrepencies to how the people fit in. The people would the voice that America claims they have. The people in swing states should not be the only ones deciding who the president is because it's not fair. What about the people in the red or blue states? Do they just get silenced completely? The people need to be heard. Make america about the people.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

To begin, The Electoral College isn't always predictable. In the article

Does the Electoral College Work states ""laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilites are."" This shows that Electors from every state may not be chosen correctly or by trustworthy sources. These Electors may also have different requirements to do their job or how to become an elector, so states will may have diffrent respones from their electors. Another example of this is shown in

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong which states ""Electors could always defy the will of the people."" This demostartes that the people who vote for these electors can easily be betrayed by the people they voted for. At any point of time these electors that should be voting for the candidate they are chosen to can change their mind and vote for whomever they please. Clearly, the electors for the Electoral College can be unpredictable and by the time are chosen it may be too late this is why we must change to popular vote.

In Adddition, The Electoral College is an unfair method of voting for voters. In the article

The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong it states ""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance winning."" This shows that candidates aren't even going to certain states because they believe the Electoral College points won't be given to them. This is unfair to voters because they can't even make a proper decison on the president because they may only see one candidate. So this entire state is not fully informed on the election and may chose the wrong candidate when there may be one that shares more of their beliefs in the election. Futhermore, in the article

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep ur despised method of choosing the President it states ""The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" This explains that potential voters may not vote because they know that candidate will most likely not win for their state. Depending on what type of people there are in that region (race, religion, political point of view) they may not vote on a certain candidate. So most voters know their one vote probably wouldn't make a diffrence. If we had popular vote everyone would have say in who is chosen for our president.

I will like to talk about changing the way that we vote for elections. I want to make voting for president based on a poular vote and not the Electoral College system. The Electoral College system is a meeting of electors where they vote for President, Vice President, and votes by the Congress. In the Electoral College system, voters do not vote for the president. Instead, they vote for a slate of electors who elects the president.

For an example of the system, if you were living in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 electors pledged to John Kerry. If the electors won the election Kerry gets 34 electoral votes. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. These electors are picked by the state and can come from different kind of conventions and party's of and by the state. The system can get very confusing, sometimes the electors dont always for who you want to be elected.

I'm asking to change voting to the most popular vote. This kind of voting is based on qualified citizens and they voting for whom ever they please. I like this system because you have a voice to speak and choose the kind of president you like. The Electoral College system is an unfair, outdated, irrational system. This kind of system is not needed in america from me speaking personally.

A word that would descibe the Electoral College system is anachronism. Anachronism is something that belongs to the past and not in the future. I can't see that kind of system being in our lives forever. Elections based on the most popular vote is good system, but us humans take advantage of that too.

Dont you think a popular vote would make it way easier for not just the fellow citizens of America but for you guys? I believe that this would be a great change not for the bad but for the good.

Not a long process or any of that. imagine just voting once for the president and being done with all that?

Wouldnt having a popular vote be less complicated? you wouldnt have to do the state elector or have any more requirements. All you have to do is whoever has more wins! also in the Elecoral College the voters dont even vote for the president but  for a slate of electors?? what is that nonsense? shouldnt citizens have the freedom of voting for who they want as president?

The biggest problem here is that we (america) are so much more advanced then the system we have right now. Over 200 years later and were still using the same system. There is so much more room for improvment but that is not happening. The advances weve made in so many aspects of goverment are not being translated into the electoral college.

A reason that people may want the electoral college is stay in place would be that the electors would do all the dirty work for them and they won't have to cast two votes the year that the new president will be chosen.

The main reason that the electoral college is unnecesary is because the voters do not get to choose who the candidates are for the electoral college, therefore not knowing who the electors are and also not knowing who the electors want to vote for. The reason that some electors choose the wrong president are because the people don't really get a say in who the electors will vote for.

87A9DEE6758F,"Dear Florida state senator,

The Electoral College may seem like a great thing to have but I think it may not be the best idea. There are plenty of reasons and one of them is that it is kind of unfair that we really don't get to vote. We vote to see who is more popular with the people but if the Electoral College wants someone else, they can vote for the person they want. People think they are voting and no one else is making the decision for them but they are being lied to. It is an unfair way of voting and is is non-democratic way in most people's eyes.

Although, most of the time the voters get who they voted for, it happened to not be that way one time. In 2000, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush won because he had more electoral votes and the people were angry. The Electoral College didn't go with what the voters wanted, but what they themselves wanted. People are being lied to that they have a say so in who should be president. Yes, most of the time they go with the voters but at any time they can disregard the popular votes and vote for who they want. If that's the case then no one should vote since they basically only have an opinion on who should be elected.

I said it was a non-democratic way before and it really is. It isn't really a free way of voting, we give an opinion and the Electoral College votes for whoever. It fits back when America was just becoming America, but it is too old now. When the Declaration of Independance was made and a little while after that is what time era I think it should have died out. It is other people voting for us. In America, we have a voice, we can state opinions, we can vote too, but the Electoral College votes for us. It is telling our opinion, it is telling who we want, but why can't we have direct voting? It just isn't fair to the voters because they aren't really voting, just expressing an opinion.

Speaking of unfair, the number of electoral votes each state gets is outragously unfair! Why is it based on the number of people in the state? Why can't people just vote directly and not have to worry about how many electoral votes they can get? For example, Florida has 29, Texas has 38, and Claifornia has 55. They are all big numbers and they can easily make a huge impact on who becomes president. The less populated states on the other hand, don't really do much justice. Maine has 4, Hawaii has 4, and Alaska has 3. It seems really unfair to those states because they have a small chance of actually making any sort of dent in the numbers. Alaska's numbers compared to California's numbers is just really unfair. If people were able to vote directly, then it would be fair game for the states with fewer electoral votes.

In the end, people know the Electoral College is an unfair way of voting. People are lied to about being able to vote because it is not direct because it is the Electoral College decides anyway. The state numbers are really unfair, it is a non-democratic way of voting, and people think it is way out of date. If the Electoral College were to trade spots with the voters who aren't in it, I'm sure they'd say that it is really unfair. People don't really get to vote, if anything, there should be direct voting like most people believe there is. It would be more fair for states like Alaska and all the other states with really small numbers. I'm sure it is easy to keep track of the numbers with electoral votes, but yet like I said, it is really unfair for the smaller populated states.

The president is not what the citizens vote for but instead they're voting for electors who elects the president. Also there is a ""winner takes it all"" system that is even more messsed up. This should definitely be changed to a popular voting process because it's 100x more fair. In this process it's the people that get to vote for the president, not the electors and there is no such thing as a ""winner takes it all system,"" which gives citizens more rights.

According to the article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , candidates dont spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didnt see the candidates at all. This is extremely unfair because almost have the states didnt even get to see the campaign!! The most important thing when it comes to electing a president is everyone knowing about it and everyone voting but the whole idea is controversal. Now if there was no such thing as an electoral college system then there wouldnt be a ""winner takes it all"" system and there wouldnt be a big mess. The citizens should be the ones electing the president because I believe that it is the citizens right to choose who they want as their president. The president is the one that is serving the Citizens and decides whats good and bad for them, not the electors. Citizens are the ones that make up a country, without them would there even be a thing as ""the united states?""

I know that you may think that a electoral process is better than popular voting because the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have a trans- regional appeal. According to the article

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , that means that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This is a good idea, but not the best idea. If we decided the president by popluar vote then this whole thing would be different, we wouldnt have to worry about electoral votes in the regions. Instead we would combine all the popular votes in all of the states to see who has the most votes.

As you can probably tell popular voting is so much better than electoral college. Electoral college is too stressful and competely unfair. While popular voting is Easy, simple, and extremely fair to everyone living in the United States. Imagine just the citizens voting for the president and counting the votes and then being done. Now imagine the citizens voting for electors and then counting the votes for that, then having the electors vote for the president and then counting for that. Which is easier and better? If I were you I say that the popular vote is better and I'd change the future elections to popular vote.                         ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
4DEE6E708F22,"I argue in favor of changing the Electoral College, to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Everyone should be allowed to vote ,on the person they want them to run the Presidency. Instead of only having 34 Democratic as the a state's voters. That way the President gets the votes that he or she desevers. They should jsut let anyone choose who the want ,having the states with diffferent opinons.

In my opinon,I think that all states representatives should have the same amount of people in the house of representatives. I don't find it fair that some states have 500,000 voters and others 35 million voters. In that case just let one state vote on who should be the next president. Let everyone vote on who they want, on whom they feel like it's the right person. Not everyopne thinks the same , not everyone believes in the same things as everyone else. Butwith the Electoral College they are not ,let the people vote on what they want in most states, for an example Texas. In Texas they only have 34 voters taht will vote on the person they were sent to vote on. Sometimes the voter would get confused and vote on the opisite person or they would just vote on who they wanted to vote on in the fisrt place.                      ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote for the president because it is a non-democratic method since voters do not get to vote for a president diectly, even though the outcome is almost always in the favor of the voter.

In these states, some voters know they have no chance of getting the president they wish to elect if the majority of the state chooses to elect the other candidate.

FB05272DAD57,"Choosing weather we should keep the electorial college or start voting by popular vote well some may say its a tough choice and others may say that its an easy one. But after awhile and you take some time to think about it, you come to your sences and see that well maybe it is a simple question. The question is does the electorial college work? the electorial college does not work because people dont always know what they're voting for, also they might not even be really taking our votes,finally they are also unfair to the voters.

To begin, the electorial college isnt good for the people because they dont always know what there voting for for example. In the second article it states that

""sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"".

Now that's a problem dont you think! most voters just go with the flow and pick who they're friends pick or they just go out and choose the first person they think is good, And because of that people dont really care about who they pick, Which is a bad thing because they might choose someone who wants to kill off half of the human race. Every one should know who they are voting for and why there voting for that person, because if not then they should just use the popular vote process.

Furthermore, we should use the popular vote process becasuse who really knows what there doing with our votes they could be throwing them away and not taking our votes. behind closed doors they could just be choosing who they want to become president. statistics show that out of 100 people 80 voted and the other 20% didn't vote at all so why does the talley say that 90% voted in the state of oklahoma when only 80% voted. now think about it they use all these out rageous numbers trying to make the person but only come to find out they're just adding on numbers making whoever they want to become president. Many people dont pay attention to the talleys and results but if you put it all together then you would see what im saying. and yes, many people would say that the electorial college is great and that they arnt doing anything fishy well if you think about if and understand the voters and see how many dont vote and how many do vote you would also see that something isnt right with these numbers. But onthe other hand if you had used the popular vote process no one would have these problems.

Finally,the electorial college is unfair to voters,in the second story it states that

""the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best"".

mostly voters should have the right to know and undrstand everything that goes on while there voting they should be aware of the candidates all of the people behind the candidates such as the extra democratics and republicans that stands behind that certain candidate. never the less I believe thatthe popular vote process is a great idea and that we should stand as one ans abolish the electorial college.

In Conclusion, the electorial college isnt good and we shopuld abolish then and replace it with the popular vote process nothings better than knowing who your voting for and why. But really think about it does the electorial college really work?    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

2114A12D2095,"Dear Florida Senator,

Our country, the United States of America, elects our presidents by something that is called the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a selection of 538 electors who vote to elect the president. The popular Presidential vote ties into the Electoral College by when a person votes for a presidential candidate, that person also votes for their chosen panel of electors from that state. Many citizens of the United States believe that this electing process is unfair and takes away the freedom to elect our President, but the Electoral College is fitting for our country because the candidates can campaign in all regions and that there will not be as big as a dispute in the Electoral College election than a popular election.

To begin with, the United States should keep the Electoral College for the presidential election because the candidates campaign in all the regions. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal."" (Source 3, stanza 19). If the United States only had a popular vote election, the candidates would only campaign to the big states(higher population), and not the the smaller states(lower population). Then the smaller states and regions we feel like they are not involved or matter in the election. ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."" (Source 3, stanza 19). Also, a presidential candidate does not want to stay in a region where he will know he will win. The presidential candidate wants to be desired and win the elections in as much regions as possible, so more of his campaign electors go to the Electoral College. ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Source 3, stanza 19).

Secondly, the United States should keep the Electoral College for the presidential election because there will not be as big as a dispute in an Electoral College election than in a popular election. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000- but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" (Source 3, stanza 18). And most of the time in an Electoral College vote, the popular vote candidate wins! ""...it is entirely possibel that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely."" (Source 3, stanza 16). Also, in a popular election, anyone can vote. That means citizens who don't know many things about the candidates or the politics can choose the future president for the United States. In the Electoral College vote, popular voters vote for a candidate's electors, who are knowledgeable about their candidates and politics, and who are carefully selected by the candidate's party. ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party"" (Source 1, stanza 5).

In conclusion, the United States should definitely keep the Electoral College for electing the president because it is fair to all the regions and there will not be as big as a dispute in the Electoral College vote than the popular vote. In the popular vote, if a person's desired candidate did not win, they could lash out, maybe violently, at other people in their community who voted for an opposing candidate. Also, the Electoral College vote is fair for the smaller states, for in the Electoral College, they get a number of electors based on their state's population. This is better than in a popular vote, where the whole state of California could vote for one candidate and the state of Rhode Island could vote for an opposing candidate. The California candidate would have more votes than the Rhode Island candidate, for Rhode Island is considerably smaller than California. Over all, the Electoral College election is the best way for the United States to elect their president. It's the way it always has been, therefore it should stay that way.

969686E764AB,"Dear Senator,

I feel that we should change using the Electoral college. The popular vote is much more effective. Using the popular vote to decide who becomes president would show who the citizens of the united states want. The popular vote shows what each state has voted for, using the Electoral college takes the right away for the people being able to vote for the president that they favor. Instead of using what the people voted for they come together to chose the candidate they predict would be the best and do the most for the country and that's not fair. If voting is important to this country then congress should understand that when the poeple vote for something everyone wants it to be their decisions that makes one of the two canidates become president not who the Electoral college believes would be best. If we could overcome the debate between what process works better more people might vote.

Although some citizens believe that the Electoral college is a good idea. I feel that if they compared not having the electoral college and only using the popular vote durning voting periods they would feel they system is more effisent. One example is big states could make a tremdous impact on which canidate wins the electon. These states have more people with more opinions that should be used durning the time of the electon for the president.

Some of the problems with the Electoral college is not only do voters not vote for their president, Back in 1960 "" The Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Deomcratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)"". ""In that same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" That is not what we are promised as a country. It states that the electoral college is suppose to cast a vote on what their state wants and what their state has chosen. That year the right to do so was taken away. Voting is a serious matter. Popular vote would clearifiy what each states popular favor is, who they want, and which candidate their vote was to be casted for.

I hope with all the information that I have just provided you with above will help to show you that the popular vote isn't only what most people want it's also the better choice.             ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I highly recomind keping the Electoral college. I personally recomind keeping Electoral college because in sourse one it states that the ""Electoral college was established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and  election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""... The Electoral College is ""widely regarded as an anachronism"" a non-democratic  method of selecting a president that ought to be over ruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. This way it is fair. Did you know that when you vote for a presidential canidate you are really voting for a slate of electors?

It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. In the Electoral College they avoid the problems of the elections which no canidate recevies a majority of the votes cast. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitition.

As a citizen of the the United States of America i feel that if we use the Electoral College, it would make things so much easier on us.

F59F0ED40C20,"Dear Mr.Senator,

I believe that the United States should switch the precidential election process to popular vote. This is due to the fact that the U.S. has grown up, and as a people we need to vote for who we believe to be a great and capable leader for our country and we can't let other people vote for us. I think that the origanal thought behind the electoral college, compromise, was good in its time, but now is no longer the time for compromise, even if the electoral college has some right ideas, such as helping us choose the correct leader. I believe it is obvious to see we will fail and make mistakes as a result of choosing our own leaders,however it is more important and more benefitial that we make our own mistakes. We need to learn from them ourselves rather than to be stopped and pointed into a direction before getting the chance to decide which path we take. Like I said before the U.S. is a big boy, it's time to take the training wheels off.

To support my idea that America should run off popular vote I shall point out some flaws with the idea the electoral college. The electoral college isn't equal. There are an unequal amount of people per state, and even though we divide power amongst those representatives equally there still isnt equal say among them as individuals, meaning a group of repsentatives from one state and one representative from another state could have the same power. How is that equal? Only in the sense that each state itself has the same amount of play in the election, but they don't, some states actually get looked over everytime the election happens. Another problem is that the representatives don't represent each person in the state or what they yern for in their leader, just the state itself. On top of the fact that the people aren't properly represented right, the people who are actually voting can just vote for who they like, which points to the fact that the electoral college has the possibility to be immoral and completely wrong.

A nation that is run by the people should be run by the people. It was said that ""a house divided cannot stand."" Now the subject that this qoute pertains to is different than that of the one I am using it in, but it is still true. The government should be as it was intended, run by the people to create a better and greater tomorrow. The people deserve the popular vote.

I think that Electoral College is a great and fast way to gather up votes to pick on our new president but i think that it has some big issues and the neagtives overcome the positives. One of the great things Electoral College brings that it is widely regarded as anarchronism with means that the votes wont be ""overruled"" it would acutally be the maguraty of the people voting on the president. If not it would be the elctors who elect the president, not the people. Also the party the people select is highly trusted and rarely betrayed. There have been a lot of cases in the past that go against Electoral College. One of the things that i am against the electoral college is that the voters dont actually vote on the presidental runner up they are actually voting on the state electors that who in turn elect the president. Also most worrying is in the case of a tie in the electrical vote. In that special case the elctection would actually have to go to the House of Representatives which means that state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vice-president. Basically the Electoral College is unfair to voters cause of the winner takes it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning so they only focus on the tight ""swing"" states. Its official in my opinion that the Electoral College  is unfair , outdated , lack of democratic pedigree and irrational. It has lack of reasons in favor. I think we should just get over with this and go old school and get done with all this confusing matter and change to election to popular votes it took more of time but it was more accurate and caused less problems.

I'm writing you this letter to discuss that we should keep the Electoral College. I think we should keep it because it's only a fair enough way of voting it is more consistant than others because if we voted by popular vote it wouldn't be much fair because as soon as most people found out there was a black president running they were against it the thought it was the worst idea ever. Instead of giving Mr. Obama the chance he deserved most people were against him. So if it wasn't for the Electoral College Mr. Barck Obama wouldn't have gotten the chance he deserved. Romeney also could've won but that's not the way Electoral College works when voting you are actually voting for a slate of electors and they chose the president.

The electoral collage some people might call it unfair or a disaster factor because it's not the people chosing the president it's the electors. The popular vote just chooses which person is more well liked not who people think will make the country a better place and so far no one is doing so. The Electoral college has a slate of trusted electors that has a certain party's nominee and the trust is rarely ever betrayed. Despite the Electoral College's lack of democratic process it's certainty of outcome is good as for example Obama's winning he received 61.7 percent of the elctoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular vote.

The Electoral College also should be kept because it prevents Run-Off Elections elections when no canidate receives majority of the votes.

E036E3908A19,"Dear The Florida State Senator,

In our nation, we use a process called the Electoral College to be a deciding factor in presidential elections. I firmly belive this system has become outdated as our country has grown. This nation says it is all about the people and what's best for us; it even says so in the U.S. Constitution, ""We the people.."" And what the people want, and need, is a fair presidential election, which can be established by making the popular vote the deciding factor.

When you think of any differentiation between two groups even back when you were a young child, how did you solve it? You vote. For example, say you and a group of friends are undecided on whether you want to go to the movies or the mall. So, you vote! Voting always has a fair outcome. It's simple. Whatever party has a higher number of votes wins and in this case becomes president. I certainly respect the idea and goal of the Electoral College, but it simply isn't quite effective. It does not make sense why we would get someone to be elected by people who have similar attributes to go represent them and vote for the presdent. It isn't very effective being that the voted Electoral College member could change their mind and vote for whomever they want instead of the candidate the people thought he/she was going to be voting for.

Think about this. Does it make sense that ""We the people"" voted for one candidate to win, but he still loses the presidency because the Electoral College overturned it? No, it does not. This is exactly what happened in Al Gore's place according to Bradford Plumer's book, ""

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong ."" Also, according to the previous cited book, due to the mishaps in Al Gore's case and others, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have know."" And similar to what was stated in the first paragraph, voters can't always control whom their electors vote for and sometimes vote for the wrong elector. All of this confusion could easily be eliminated if we eliminated the Electoral College.

Direct voting is way easier and way more accurate to whom the nation wants to be the president. It eliminates the confusion some voters may get if they are unsure which elector feels similar to how they feel about each candidate. It eliminates the hastle of electing electors in the first place. It eliminates the uncertainty voters have about each electoral candidate, being that they could change their mind whenever they please. And best of all, it eliminates the unfair, irrationality of the Electoral College.

0DC356971CE2,"To whome this may concern the electoral college is out dated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a  big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representives witch would be another unfair vote, beacuse each representive stands for everyone in the state. So if the representive in MA was demcrait and the representive in TX was republican then the mjorty vote would most likely go to the republicans.

Other examples of how unfair the system is the ""winner take all"" system. Reasons it is unfair is that the the running candidates don't go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don't even get to see the adds for some candudates beacuse that stat mjorty is either repubclain or demacrat. That is unfair to the people  that are in the oppsite party in that state. Futher more the system is unfair to people in states where the mjorty is something diffrent from the party they are in.

Last but not least the system is out dated. The electoral college has been around since the constution was writen but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and mjorty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two parragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is out dated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in who they pick. a reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to. More reasons would be how the electoral college has been around since the constution. although other systems from that time still seem to work this one does not and it will continue to fail until it just stops working altogether.

DCB80D17A96A,"Many people are not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Many prefer changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States since the Electoral College is unfair. It is. The electoral college is unfair in many ways and we should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

One reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote instead of the Electoral College is because the states aren't all equal and electoral college isn't fair. In the Electoral College, California has more of a say than Georgia. California has 55 electoral college, while Georgia has 16. How is that fair? ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"" (Plumer 13). This line tells us that candidates stay out of states that they know they won't win. Say there was a candidate campaigning, they will most likely focus on the states that have the most electoral college, like California or Texas. They won't go to states that only have three votes. That's not fair to the states that have a small population. ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 6). If electoral votes wasn't a thing, Gore would be president. He's the candidate that won most popular votes, meaning that he got the most votes in the nation. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer 10). Not always? What's the point of voting if the vote won't even count?

Another reason why the United States should change the election to popular vote is because the popular vote will be more precise and it's much easier. There could be less ties, and the candidate that everyone really wants as president will become the president. ""Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"" (Posner 16). Gore was the candidate that everyone wanted as president. It just doesn't seem fair that the candidate that won popular vote, isn't or wasn't the president.

now like i said in the first paragraph the hispanic one in mexican now why that would be important is that since he is mexican a lot of ignorant people are gonna say he cant be president he needs to be born in merica well that is true but the thing is he is from america but his ethnicity is mexican so realy i should have refraised that he is mexican american meaning that the little loop whole has just been closed so he can be president but for the people who are still dumb and cant exept another race you still have hope if you look on the map of american the electoral college with the sencond most electors is in good old texas with 38 voters (the most goes to cali but thats not important) and what does texas have well one of the highest rates of mexican imigrants one of the highests numbers of kkk members you know racist stuff so yea with texas having one of the most i dont see an colored president in a long time i still have now idea why another guy cant be friends with some one cause there colored life is like a box of crayons one color the people like more and all the others they hate cant we all just be color blind so now im gonna hit you with some truth because the states with some of the highest rate of blacks and hispanics also have the lowest number of electors im not saying that the goverment said colored people there lets give them 5 voters its like that because the states with more black and hispanic people are also some of the poorest states in america so its not all the goverments fault good job america.

so how do we fix that well i say that the goverment should send money to not only to the state itself but to the citys in them so give some money to detroit and chigago without them we wouldent have the worst team in the nba (just kidding) and a team that had a legend so i also say take the number of states with more electors and transfer them to the smaller ones so take 10 from texas and give them to main and 15 from cailfonia and give them to all small state know what im saying or nah.

so on to the next thing that they need to fix so it says that the most populer vote becomes presidet seems pretty legit exept for the fact that its not legit at all if have some one that has done so much like serve in the military fought in afginistan or somthing like and he can do oficial stuff then he deserves it but if a actor runs for president some one like eddy murphey vs obama whos gonna win starts with and e and ends with a y who is it eddy murpey he will always win how do you think arnald shwazinager became govener of califonia and i know he had so skill if office but still a old man who uses steroids vs a middle aged man who know alot about being a president so i say we should get rid of the populer vote and pick the one with skill we should let the three best run america for one month each and see how each one does at the if we lose evrething well then they weren a good president now were they so yea it could work.                                     ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E1BAC2DFC0BA,"Every vote makes a difference. Every single vote plays a role in electing a president, whether it be directly, or indirectly. The Electoral College has caused a lot of controversy with that thought. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer 14) Where are the facts behind the argument against it? We all hear people complaining and saying these things, but they have no facts as to why abolishing the Electoral College would be beneficial. The Electoral College is working in the peoples' favor and i believe we should keep it.

There are so many uneducated voters. People that vote for the presidential candidate at the top of the list because they have no clue who any of the people are anyway. If the president was selected by just popular votes who knows what the nation would be like. Every vote counts. Yes, this is true even with Electoral College it just a process to make sure that the votes being sent in are educated and well thought out; not chosen out of laziness. Do we want the people who vote just to say they voted to have a huge say in who runs our country? I sure don't. I'd rather have a trusted group of people who are very well educated take our votes into huge consideration and seal the deal. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nomonee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)..."" (Posner 16). Richard A. Posner goes on to tell us how many times the trust has been betrayed... the most recent being in the election year 2000 and then the only other time the electoral vote did not reflect the popular vote was 1888. There's no reason to change a system that isn't broken.

Obviously the system has its flaws, but nothing is perfect. Sure the Electoral College messed up twice, but that isn't some mass amount that was detrimental to our nation. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" (Office of the Federal Register 1) It's a compromise that has worked for so long; there's not enough valid reasons to change it.

The Electoral College gives the right amount of representation to different sized states. ""The Popular vote was very close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes."" (Posner 21) The majority of the state was in favor of Obams's ideas so 29 Electoral votes would work in their states favor, instead of having an almost tie vote which would make a smaller difference in the outcome. The Electoral College votes are like each states individual votes for the candidate that would make the majority of that one state happy, or that would benefit that one state. So yes, the popular vote may not always win, but the outcome of the presidential election is based on which person was the favorite of the majority of each individual state.

All in all, the Electoral College works for this nation. It worked for our founding fathers and it's still working for us, no matter what people want to argue. If ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" (Plumer 9) then the majority of our country should be able to come up with a valid argument against it.

F760D3198FDE,"Dear Florida State Senator,

We, the people have been given the Electoral College in order to allow both us and congress a say on who will be the next face of our country. I know that you should not fix what is not broken, but maybe it time to allow some changes in our election. The Electoral College attempts to maintain a fair voting process, but like many great ideas it comes with a few kinks.

""Non-swing"" states have it rough when its time for voting season, because their chances of ever getting their voice heard are slim to nothing. In the second source; paragraph thirteen, the Office of the Federal Register mentioned that candidates spend their time on ""swing"" states due to them having a better chance of suceeding there than, ""non-swing"" states. This is unfair to the citizens of those states not being able to get a word in, let alone a simple acknowledgement of who they may be voting for. Even in the third source; twentieth paragraph, the 'OotFR' mention that only those few lucky states chosen will receive more information on the candidates than those unfortunate few who were discarded like an old newspaper.

Votes are solely dependent on the electors of the states, as shown in paragraph ten of source two. Voter often get confused over who they are placing their votes towards,often voting for the wrong candidate or have no control, whatsoever. In the following paragraph, John F. Kennedy was in trouble back in 1960 because of the LA state legislature nearly got new electors so that most of Kennedy's popular vote would not be received at all. Overall the electors play crucial part in the Electoral College, but must could not trusted to hold that much responsibilty.

All-in-all, the Electoral College contains  some flaws, which is normal. I'm not asking for you to abolish it altogether, but compromise and evenly distribute the power of the votes and who gets a say on what is happening.

BA6AC1A0DD5D,"The electoral college is pointless, I believe that it is just another step that was added to the long process of picking our new president. It causes problems between the people and the government and it takes away time that we could be using to do something actually beneficial to our country. The electoral college is not a place but a group of people who meet and vote for the President and Vice President. Each state gets represented by a certain amount of electors which is decided by the population of that specific state. The electoral college should be thrown out of the way that we choose our president becuase it upsets the people, it can completley change elections, and because it gives to much power to the legislative branch.

I think that the electoral college gets people frustrated with our government. They have to go basically vote for another person to vote. If I lived in texas I would go to a poll and vote for the person that I wanted to put up in the electoral college. That person would then vote for the president. It makes voters, mad why spend time for voteing on people who you dont really care about when you could honeslty just vote for the President who you believe could help our country. The biggest argunment against the electoral college is that it we can't control who our elector votes for. You see when you go to vote for an elector you normally vote for one who says that they are going to vote for the person that you like, but they can change their mind and now you voted for someone that is going to vote for the candidate that you didnt want.

The electoral college can completely change the direction of a vote. Becuase voters only have one vote, the electors represent alot of the states population. For example a single representitive from samller states like Wyoming can represent of to 500,000 voters and in bigger states like California can have up to 55 electors who represent as much as 35 million people. This is why the electoral college can have such a big effect on the voting proces exspecially since the electors represent such a large amount of people. It can become frustrating when a large mass of people ellect some one and that elector changes there mind about  who they vote for, because a group of people as large as 500,000 can be ruiting for one person and the elector can change his mind and now that group 500,000 is voting for someone that they don't like.

Another problem is that the electoral college gives to much power to legislative branch ""Back in 1960 segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy becuase it would have been overthrown by the college. Which meens that the Legislative branch has enough power to create a biased slait. The legislature would create a group of electors that are all in favor of certain idea and you wouldnt be able to vote for anyone else becuase those are the people for your state. The point of voting is to give power to the people and with the electoral college in the way it completely takes that away from us. We get to vote for the electors but that doesnt meen that they are going to vote for the people that we want them to.

Yes the electoral college could have some advanteges like allowing professionals to have an input into what is going on, It helps us avoid run-off elections (elections that end up with a tie), and restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. But there are definalty more cons to this procedure. The constitution states that we are here to create a more perfect union but how are we supposed to create a union when the government is basically in control of everything. There is no unity gouing on in our government it more like the government is in charge and we are kind of just here. If we get rid of the electoral college it will make the people happier and allow them to actually feel like part of the government, It will stabilize elections and not allow the legistaure to change them, and will take away some of the numerous powers that the Legislative branch holds. All in all the electorla cllege os unfair, outdated, and irrational. It need to be abolished!            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
575107B10B0B,"Dear State Senator,

The one word used throughout this whole article ; catastrophic, which is whats best used to describe the electoral college. The United States of America, born and based off of popular soverignty, should be just  that ; decided by the people. The electoral college has only been a hindrance since its arrival, confusing American Citizens left and right, becoming an issue to voters/interested future voters, and disallowing a fair chance of a voters vote to be of importance in their state, and to their country. The electoral college should be disbanded and reiterized by popular vote because of TWO main reasons:it does

NOT

allow for a simple method of voting, and it does

NOT

allow for every vote, and voice to be heard in the United States presidency election, tarnishing this countrys' right of democracy, causing outrages all over the country.

To initialize this one-sided argument, lets begin with an important factor that the electoral college cannot be trusted on achieving, the fact that every vote counts. With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register ""Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like  how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.

Theories on how a single vote doesn't matter have been given, as stated in Par. 23 Source 3 by Richard A. posner ""Voters in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."", who also comes to contradict themselves originally with ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43% Percent plurality"". In that instance, that one vote could've made a HUGE difference on our future. On top of that, so many voices in states that arent swing states (States that could go democratic or republican, and aren't fixated on only 1 party) that have been silenced could add up to be a tremendous amount of 'single votes', changing this nations history drastically.

Furthermore onto this argument ; one thing is known as a world wide factor that applies to almost everything that we do. Simpler, is better. If you take your precious time and read all Par. 1-8 in Source 1, what you will gather, is that an extremely over-afflictionated method is used when determining our next president.  Step by step instructions on selecting, choosing, voting, controling, and nevermind the problems it has already caused from the confusion of all these instructions. Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote. This would furthermore simplify our country way of voting, attracting more voters, and overall satisfying many people.

Some have also stated that this is necessary to providing a more organized form of voting. Key knowledge that must be analyzed is that: just because a service is organized, does NOT mean its correct. Referencing to Par. 11 Source 2 Bradford Plumer describes on how ""The American People should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century; the system allows for much worse."" and ""that those elctors could always defy the will of the people."" in Par. 9 ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al-Gore-Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Many problems that would not ocurr if our way of voting were to be simplified into popular vote.

To summarize, and simplify (what should be done with our voting ways) this letter to you, we should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting, to which our country is based off of. This is the most profound way of fixing the problems that we face: the unsimplicity known as our current voting ways, and the restablishment of our original, and hopefully still true government of Democracy, and Popular Soveriegnty.

EB382D12574F,"DO YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL VOTE?

At long on the History, There's strange and curios case in the story of the political, especialy in United State of America (U.S.A) The political allways had serius problems, like corruption, the confusion of what president choose, the bad counting vote, etc. But with all those problems that happens in the world.. How United States choose good presidents? First, we are going to talk about the curius case in the U.S.A talking about the political and how U.S.A choose the future president.

There's alot of curios case in the U.S.A. For example, it's said clearly in the article that for first time in the story of U.S.A there's 2 represents to be president that came from the state of Hawaii in 1960, and those represent was against Jhon F. Kennedy. Or the other case that the Electoral system in those times it was very confused and for each state it represents 1 vote so The legendary John Kerry wins 34 democratics votes. There was alot of controversy.

But with all those problems, how those U.S.A choose good there presidents? The goverment like there citizen have clearly 5 things (according the article wrote by Richard A. Posner) That are: ''Certainty of Outcome'' That is selecting a president that ougth to be who most votes receives is the winner. ''Everyone's President'' Means that is a resulr by a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.''Swing State'' Is a method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates.''Big States'' Is a large state that gets more attention from presidentail candidates in a campaign than small state does.. And the last one is ''Avoid Run'off Elections'' That it could be argued method selecting the president may turn off by potential voters.

In my opinion, i'm pro with. Is a very nice Goverment and Can helps every country in the world becouse there potential economic that they have.                             ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
3C11CE4316CA,"Dear state senator, to the people voting is the most important part of politics. You out of all people speak politics, so you should understand. Keeping the electoral college would be many more great successful years in voting because of the certainty of outcome, it would take care of the swing and big states, and it avoids run-off elections.

Disputes over the outcomes of an electoral vote is possible. The winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds the popular vote. In other words in 2012 Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the votes while Romney recieved only 51.3, and because almost all of the states award winner-takes-all even a slight chance of popularity could change the results. It is very unlikely for this to happen. Although there are many things wrong with the electoral college like making peoples votes not exactly count, it is something to figure out.

For the swing and big states, the voting is slightly different. The voters in the toss-up states tend to pay more attention to the campaign than any other place. They really get into the whole campaign and really listen to all of what the competing candidates say and do. For the big states, the electoral college does them a favor and gives them more electoral candidates. It restores the weight in the balance that large states lose by virtue.

The electoral college does us a big favor by avoiding run-off situations, that could lead tomore complicated situations. The run-off election occurs when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. These run-off elections cause a lot of pressure, and surely does complicate the presidential election.

In conclusion, staying with the electoral college process, it would maintain our problems of eun-off elections, certainty of the outcome and the big and swing issues.                                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5EA56D69C224,"dear state senator i think you should change to election by popular vote because its worked for us in the past no one can cheat on the voting. those are just some of the reasons we should change to election by popular vote  as a voting system.

first of all we should change to election by popular vote. because its the easiest way of voting because if we keep using the electoral college according to source 3 its un fair because states that are bigger get more attention than smaller states. and also source 2 says ""its official the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"".

second of all election by popular vote is the fairest way of voting because unlike the electoral college tjhe popular vote would make the number of votes per state even so not on state gets more votes than another. according to source 3 ""the number of electoral votes depends on the size of the state in which you live so the means if you live in a small state your state gets less electoral votes than a big state"". and in the electoral college some people chaet and vote more than once giving that president an even bigger chance of winning.

the final reason i think we should change to the election by popular vote is its more efficient think about it would you want a voting method that depends on the size of your state i mean what if you lived in rhode island where you get 3 electoral votes versus texas which has 38 electoral votes but with the election by popular vote it counts which canidate has more votes and based on those numbers thats who gains presidency.

in a nut shell the reason we should use the election by popoular vote is its more efficient more fair and easier to decide whos president. so mr senate please read this and consider it i think theese are all very good reasons we should make the change.                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

531CEBD0E4F8,"Politics is everywhere and it rules our everyday lives. Each United States citizen has a role in choosing how our politics can operate. It might not be a huge role but it definately is an important small role. The presidential election happens every four years on the first tuesday of November. There is an electoral college which is the compromise between election of president by vote in congress and by popular vote of citizens. As state senator, I think you should keep the electoral college running because it is a safer option than just doing election by popular vote.

The electoral college consists of professionals in congress that are more specialized in politics then an average citizen is. The electoral college should be handed the trust to control our politics. There must be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect that President. Each candidate running for president must have his or her own electoral group. The electors are chosen by the candidates political party, which means the person running for President if in good hands with his electoral college.

Al Gore lost the presidency, but he won the popular vote. Maybe the professionals in the electoral college saw a flaw in him that the average citizen would not see. 60% of people prefer doing the direct election (popular vote). The direct election would only satisfy themselves temporarily, but what if this president that got elected put the whole country in a downfall. Then people would realize how important the electoral college is.

There are some cases where the election process ends up being a disaster. What if citizens weren't able to chose the electors and the state legislatures were fully in charge of choosing those electors. Well, the electors can still chose to go by what the people want. In 1960, the segregationist almost replaced Democratic electors with the new electors that opposed John F. Kennedy. Some electors have even went against their political party's candidate and only choose who they wanted to chose. The segregationist that were in power at that time only wanted what they thought was best for them and not what was best for the people. Situations like this must require the votes and thoughts of the average citizens combined with the electoral college.

The electoral college has voters voting for electors only and not the president. The electoral college should stick around forever. Popular votes might not always be the best option. The citizens still have a say in which electors shall be chosen and that plays a part in electing the president. Even though voters are not always able to control who the electors vote for, they still have a part in chosing who will be president.                        ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?

Why are 538 people the ones who get to decide who becomes president and not the rest of us? The Electoral College is outdated and too old for todays society. Lets get rid of this while we can.

The Electoral College was made many years ago by the founding fathers, this can tell you it is outdated. People used to have completely different political views back then, we need a fresh start on how we want it today because things have changed. We the people should vote on what we want now an Electoral College vs. a popular vote by the people and redecide since it has been over a thousand years later.

""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" says Bradford Plumer in source two. Plumer is right about this, the electoral college is very unfair.

EE0EDEEB4336,"Dear Mr. senator

The Electoral college process consists of 538 electors. Each elector represents a state and they vote according to what the majority of the people favor. The Electoral college is a fair and honest way of electing the president because each individual has a voice in who is elected by voting for the state electors .""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors""(Does the Electoral College Work?). This shows how everyone plays a key role in the government and in electing the main person in charge.

Many people may argue that the Electoral college is corrupt because it is a ""non-democratic"" way of electing a president and that the electors may not vote in favor of the people's majority. This is true, however,""that trust is rarely betrayed""(Does the Electoral College Work?)."" It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national poular vote""(Does the Electoral College Work?), but this too has rarely happened. We need to continue with the Electoral college process despite a couple rarely occuring cons because all of the reasons to retain this fair system heavily outways the negative. There are five main arguements to continue the use of this justified system.

The first reason is ""certainty of outcome."" A conflict over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is rare and less likely to occur than a dispute over the popular vote. "" The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote""(Does the Electoral College Work?). A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is also highly unlikely to occur.

This second argument is ""Everyone's president."" ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal""(Does the Electoral College Work?). This is so the residents of other regions don't feel deserted and that their votes don't count. Every president should have this desirable result so that he/she can be a successful president.

The third main argument is ""Swing States."" ""The winner-take-all mathod of awarding eletoral votes induces the canidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states....voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign""(Does the Electoral College Work?). These electoral voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters and should be able to decide the election.

The fourth reason to retain the Electoral College system is that ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states(by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution""(Does the Electoral College Work?). A large state would get more attention than a small state and I think that this is fair because the larger states by population should get more votes because they contain more people.

The fifth and final reason that we as a nation should favor the Electoral College is because it ""avoids run-off elections.""The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast""(Does the Electoral College Work?). The Electoral College takes the huge pressure off of run-off elections and clearly produces a winner.

I hope that you take into consideration what I said and help the Electoral College continue to thrive over the years because without this system the nation will be in a big dispute. I know that this is the best system for our country and state and I strongly hope that you see that too.

8EDF6595D2FA,"Dear State Senator , I wrote this letter to you to talk about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. My opinion on this intriguing subject is that we should keep the Electoral Collge , my reasons being that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the Run-Off Elections. When its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of electors , they just vote for the most apealling to them , the one that is always out and doing meetings, or brunches , or just having a perfect day with their family . People that research or dig deep to find out who they are really voting for .

Let me start by saying that the ones whom created the Electoral College , where our founding fathers , these men are thought as wise and caring for their country. The reason stated why the Electoral College should be kept because popular voting can go wrong. Yes the popular vote of the Electoral College its worth but maybe not that much.  In Defense of the Electoral College : Five reasons to keep our depised method of choosing the President , it states that "" But each party...win the national popular vote""(source 3).  Posner is stating that each party picks their electors to be trustworthy , not someone who would do dirty work behind their backs. People go out and vote for our next president and see them running our country , but sometimes people vote for a president for the reasons being that they just want to vote . Its not like the lines outside are not long enough for a person to just go into the voting booth and pick a random president and just leave. People dont actually look behind, search for whom they are votting for .Thats why the Electoral College shouldnt be ruled out , the Electoral College is actually helping out more then we thought. When we least expect it we have a crazy wako running our country , then that would be the time when the people would Notice that they made a huge mistake .

Run-Off elections , sounds like a tedious process. When Run-Off elections occur some people get annoyed , why its a longer process . We get a little bit delayed on finding out on whom the president of the United States is going to be . People want to know who going to be the next president of their country , whos going to try to fix the small little problems the last president left . THose are mainly alll the questions these voters ask. In The Indefensible Electoral College :Why Even the best-laid defenses of the system  are wrong , Bradford states "" At the most basic level...in the ""swing"" states"" (source 2). Bradford claims that the candidates dont spend much time in states that they know wont get plenty of votes. Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good . Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states why because the candidiates arent paying so much of the their attention and aren't caring for those states votes . This country runs off on what the people want but sometimes are the people being fair?.

Keeping the Electoral College can be a really good thing do to the fact there are people that do know about choosing a president .It's been stated before that some people dont care at all who the next president is, as lonmg as they fix their problems and they have jobs, and good medicare they are perfectly fine who the president is . The Electoral College is like a helping hand .                      ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I would say lets get rid of the electoral college vote the reason is because the voters vote for slate of electors. They really are not letting the people speak their mind about who should really be president. Like it said in the story and I quote""

sometimes the slate of electors might vote for the other side

"". Also it says in the passage that the electoral college vote ""is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". The eletoral college vote is just a waste of time to be honest.

Another reason why I think we should get rid of the electoral college vote is because it really doesn't make any sense to have it. The popularity vote should be the one that counts the reason is because it gives the voters the chance to vote for the president instead of having that eletoral college vote where they can't just easily just vote for the new president. The other thing is that in the electoral college votes it goes by slate of electors well some states have more electors than others like californa and texas all states should have an equal amount of voters instead of just giving the big states the all of the power.

The last reason why I think we should get rid of the electoral college vote is because of the disaster factor. In the year of 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis. In 1960 segregationists in louisiana the lesgislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democrtic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. the other thing is what if their is a tie between the two. The whole election would be thrown to the house of representitves.

These are all the reasons why I think we should get rid of the electoral college votes because it is more easy doing the popularity vote because it gives the people to speak on who they want to be president.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I strongly believe that we have to change the way we vote because the Electoral College is a horrible way to vote. It is not fair one bit and i think we should vote for the candidates that deserve to truely win. Not have it where we vote for someone but we actually are just voting for a slate of 34 electors who are pledged to the runner.

Electoral college has so many disagreements, but then it has agreements. This way of voting avoids run-off elections because if two candidates had the same amount of popular votes then they look at the electoral votes and it helps them know who is the winner. In large states they try to do electoral votes becuase it gives the presidential candidates more attention in a campaign than smaller states do.

Then we have the disagreements and they are pretty good logical points. When we use this system we dont vote for the president we are only voting for a slate of electors that elect for the president themselves. This just basically in my eyes looks like a cheat election and it shouldnt even count. Another thing is this method of selecting our president turns off potential voters for a candidate that has no intension of carrying for their state. Some people just vote to vote so they dont care of what might happen to their surroundings but then there are people that are voters and care and want to express a political preference other than the people that think a single vote will decide an election.

""Electoral Votes get overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner"". The electors are the ones that are voting not the people.

CA96B56226D3,"Dear Mr. Senator,

The way the voting is now in the United States needs to be changed. It should change from Electoral College to popular vote. The voting system is an all or nothing system which means lots of peoples votes would not count for the president they want. If the voting system changes the president would actually be picked by the people and not by a group of people who won the popular vote.

The electoral college is unfair to many people because their vote goes to waste if the other slate of electors won. In Source 2 it says ""On the off-chance that those electors win the statewide election, they would go to Congress and... would get... electoral votes."" That is saying that part of the votes would not count because the other group won and not the one they wanted to win. So then the president will get a certain number of electoral votes based on the population of that state. Some people feel like their votes are not needed as much because if the majority of that state chose the other candidate.

The electoral college is a good idea, but people can betray the trust of others. In Source 3 it says ""...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."" That means the voters have the ability to vote for the other candidate. If someone decides to vote for the other candidate then some peoples votes will have been for nothing. If we had the popular vote voting system then everyones vote would go to the specific candidate, and people would not have to hope the person they slate they pick has everyone pick the candidate they were trusted to vote for.

In the end the voting system of the United States is built on trust. If we have the popular vote voting system everyones vote would go to the candidate that wanted it to go to and not have their vote be wasted on a slate that may or may not win. With the popular voting system the president would win on popular vote and not electoral vote; therefore, the president could not cheat his way to power by targeting big states.

Other things being rqual a larger state will get more votes than a smaller state. in Florid in 2012 when obama won the electoral election by only 3 votes also a victory in Wyoming in the same margin. Also all larger statees get more attention from the presidential candates. If we keep this going how it is eventualy are vote arent going to even count it will all be up to the electoral college. When casting your vote your vote you should know that it may not count because the elecoral college is supossed to count and seperate the votes and vote for a specific one but tecnically anybody from the electoral college can cast their vote for anyone they choose.

If you were to look at wyoming and Californias votes California would have an unbelivably amout more votes casted than wyoming would. Thats simply because acalifornia is a much bigger state and can easily get 35 million voters while Wyoming can only gwt 500,000 voters which lowers Wyomings chance of  getting the president they would like too have. anf to equal theese out thee electoral college would have a group of people that would vote for a specific person but here this becomes an issue is when the electoral  college vote for whom they want to vote for instead of eho they are told to choose for and it makes the voting unequal.

Keeping the voting system hoe it is right now is a verry bad idea and something needs to be done about it.

The electrol collage should not be kept as popular votes for the president of the united states.

During the 2000 campaign, seventeen of the stes did not see or heard about the canadidates and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not fet to see a single campaing ad. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. Abolish the electoral collage!

The electoral college is very irrational. Electoral collage method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The republicans in claifornia, knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes .

The Electoral College has been around for many years now and chosen who would become president of our country.

When citizens vote its known as the popular vote. Even though we vote every four years, its honestly a waste of time because the Electoral College doesnt care what we think. What matters to them is that they make the final decision on which president they think we care about more. Its not fair to us! We deserve a say in who we want to lead us in the right direction.

Back in the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana's legislature just about succeeded in changing the Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded, John F. Kennedy would have never became presedent even though the popular vote wanted him.

996FD5290FB3,"Dear state senator,

The electoral college is an unfair and irrational, and should be abolished immediately. The fact that the race for president can end in a tie is completely absurd. Also the fact that popular vote can mean basically nothing is dumbfoundidng. In a country of democracy popular vote seems like a it would be standard. popular vote seems like the best idea when it comes to a country for the people.

The electoral college is highly unfair to voters. Presidential candidates dont even have to visit all of the states to win the elections. The representation that the smaller states get is unfair. Presidential canidates will only visit states with a high number electoral college representatives because the states are known as ""swing states"". Swing states greatly influence the outcome of the election because they can hold the most power. If a state such as texas with 34 electoral votes was to have the same amount of power as a state with a much smaller population than the electoral college would seem much more viable.

The electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with that states popular vote. Al Gore, in the 2000 presidential election, won the popular vote but still lost the election(Plumer 9). The fact that a canidate can win the vote of the people but still lose the election is horrifying. How can you trust a system that works against what the United States of America is about. It completely takes away the right of people to decide what goes on in there goverment. The fact that the electoral college state representatives do not have to vote with people is highly unfair.

There is one crucial flaw in the electoral college, the election can end in a tie. In 1976 a tie would have occured if just 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way(Plumer 12). If we were to switch to a system were all states including the District of Columbia get one vote then the election could never end in a tie. Although this still seems highly unfair to the voters because the representative could go either with or against the popular vote the election could still never end in a tie solving the amjor flaw. What was to happen if we did have a tie? It has not yet been desided because it never has happened and that is a major problem.

The electoral college is highly unfair and should be disposed of immediately. The electoral college is biased towards the larger states,has major flaws that can only be fixed by getting rid of the system and does not give a fair view of what the people want. The system was poorly thought out and needs to be replaced.

DFC9B86ECAA9,"I think that we should change it to populure vote, as in like who ever gets the most votes, but on a national scale, not on a state scale.  why? well I realy would have to agree that an even number could cause a tie. Even if the tie was settled by the congress and senate there could be major problems. like for example lets just say that the last election was a tie, the out come of the tie would be Romney as president ( whitch would be good) and Joe Biden as vice president ( realy bad). and the reason this could be very bad, because of the fact that the two of them have very diferent opinions the two of them would probably be so busy arguing that they wouldn't get anything done, plus Joe would constantly be trying to get Romney impeached.

My second reason is becuse yes one of the guys who puts in our votes could put it in incorectly because of the fact that somone could simply bribe him or her to do so.  The scary thought is that if one person does it and gets away with it then every one with lots of money will try, just like someone could try and bribe me to tell them what this test is on ( i wouldn't say unless it was well over $200 but no one I know has that much they would want to spend on a test so nobody has tried to bribe me).

So now my third reason is it would be prety cool to know that the next president could be decided by a single vote but that is even more unlikely than a tie with our current system. But it would be more likely that it could come down to a more probable minimum of around a milion.

One reason is that voters don't vote for what President they want, they vote for a slate of electors. A slate of electors is a group of electors that are biased towards a political party but understand politics more than any average person. Someone might say that election by popular vote is better because its more fair for every President in the race. This is because the slate of electors are biased towards one group, so say a republican running for President goes to a slate of electors full of democrats, there's no way he's going to win.

This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. On the other hand many people belive that Electoral College is unfair to some people. Many people want to abolish Electoral College.

Secondly, the Electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be declared the candidate who recives the most popular votes. The electoral restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate. The Electoral college avoids the problem of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

8D7CBF2251F1,"The electoral college  has been used for many years. Most people think that it is a place and not a process , well it is a process. the electoral college is the selection of electors. for the process they need 538 electors, for 270 electoral votes. Each canidate has their own group. The presidential election is held every  four years to elect or keep the same president for 4 years. I think that its the way to vote ,and its worked for so many years why fix it if its hasnt had a problem yet.

The electoral college is well known and has always been the way to pick our president. its a non-democratic method of selectiing the president. the other side who are for popular vote think that the electoral college is unfair and that there is not a certainty of a fair outcome. i say that if the outcome isnt fair then how are u supposse to win as a president. Having more votes as a canidate is not fair but thats how you win by having more votes.

My opinion on that is why would losing be fair thats the point one canidate wins and one loses. of couse the other person who lost would have anger and therefore be upset and say that the electoral is an unfair jugdement. The candiate wins because of the majority vote in their designated states. if the other canidate dosent have as many states he could only win by the collected vote within the states that he/she has.

popular vote would be awful and much harder to do as a process. that would mean that every one in the United States would vote who they want and it be sent to the capital to see whos victorious. Popular vote has no process or stragey or base plan to vote , and what if states dont like this idea so they revolt against the goverment. states might get together with there senate and riot in order to stop this.

In my opinion popular vote is messy, controversial and just down right uncalled for there is a plan within the electoral college and i think that they should keep was has been working. yes we are evolving as a whole but somethings are left to be the same and not tamperd with.                        ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E8A75D7CC617,"The electoral college isnt an normal conversating subject for everyday life, although it is important. Without the Electoral College We the People wouldnt have a president to help run our country as a whole. The way the College works may be confusing but it all ties together in the end- a new president is elected every four years.

Particurly, there are a total of five hundred and thirty-eight electors. But around two hundred and seventy votes is required to eclect the president. Everyone has jobs. Meaning, they are either all apart of parties or are in charge of an party that has decided to go and represent somebody that is running. The ""state"" of Columbia is in a way treated differently. The reasoning Columbia is quotations is because there was quite a discussion on wheather or not it should be counted, in the end result- according to the article ""Source 1: What is the electoral college?"" ""For soem reason, in the following discussion the word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia"". That being said the more votes the better and fair to all of the People. As each candidate runs to be elected for Preisdency the elector has a party in which they support fully and represent one another as a whole. As they represent they start to get people excited for the new incoming President and saying why they believe he/she is the best and deserves to dedicate their time. All of these processes go on because everyone deserves to share their opinion and say and choose their preferred President.

Another smart point is, everyoen should be given a chance. That being said, no matter if youre a women or man and have the desire to work in the Electoral College or even run for president, I personally believe that everyone should be treated equal and be given an oppurtuninty to show the wiseness and what they have to offer. Stated from ""Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" just so hapeens in number four to say, ""So other things are being equal, a large state gets more attention from the presidental candidats in a campaign than a small state does"". Basically saying that everyone doesnt get the chance to choose if its not given and thats not how we the People need to be, if we want help protecting our country for the ones that are against us with grudges, and to help keep our roadways clean and avaliable, and to help hire us at the jobs we want, then truly we need to support them as well. and give them equality!

In summation, the electoal college is an important part of our Government and Presidency itself, but all the proscesses and ect. that is also involved also plays a role and makes it just as necessary. Without out we woudlnt be able to vote for the right and needed President because we wouldnt know what is need, required, and more. With it, it makes everything make sense. With all the people that are in the committee makes it ten times better in chossing who and how we want to be represented. Electing our president is just as important of the Electoral College.

310355544D30,"In the intense debate concerning the validity of the Electoral College process, it is difficult to choose a position. The Electoral College is a long-standing tradition created by the founding fathers in the early days of the United States. However, the reasons behind the adoption of the Electoral system are not as valid today as they were centuries before. Electoral College was proposed by the founding fathers due to the fact that the average American citizen in the beginning of our nation was a simple farmer, who was not educated enough to make an informed decision in a vote. Nowadays, things are different. General education of the public is very advanced, and there are various easily acessable forms of media from which to learn about the policies and positions of the presidential canidates. After all, the president's job is to care for and protect the people of America, not the politicians. Therefore, shouldn't the people, not the politicians, elect the president?

Even those who support the Electoral College must admit it is a confusing system. When a citizen votes for a presidential canidate, that vote really goes to a slate of electors who were selected by means that vary between states and are pleged to that particular canidate, and those electors then vote for the president. As pointed out in Bradford Plumer's

The Indefensible Electoral College , voters can't control who their electors vote for. Aditionally, ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate"" (also Bradford's

The Indefensible Electoral College

). And Bradford makes a good point; in the past, ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate"".

There is also the fact that canidates for the presidency often focus on ""swing states"", states whose majority is not decided between political parties and whose votes have a large impact on the election. This is due to the winner-take-all method of the Electoral College. In a state that is mostly Republican, a Democratic presidential canidate may not put much into the local campain, knowing that since most voters are against them they would probably lose the state and gain nothing, because all the electoral votes of a state go to the canidate who won the majority of voters in that state. Thus, presidential campains are focused in the swing states, giving little attention to the others. However, if the presidential election were decided by popular vote, campain efforts would be spread evenly across the United States since every voter everywhere counted in the final election.

The method of electing a president by popular vote is a fair and well-balanced one, giving the minority parties in non-swing states a say in the presidency. Also, it was  discovered that ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000...over 60 pecent of voters would prefer a direct election"" (Bradford Plumer,

The Indefensible Electoral College

). It was even admitted by pro-Electoral College Richard A. Posner in his

Defense of the Electoral College that ""A tie in the national electoral vote is possible"" due to the even number of total votes. Posner also states that ""no voter's vote swings a national election"". However, if everyone believed that, no-one would vote at all. Then there could be no election, Electoral College method or otherwise. Therefore, the individual voter does count, and so do all the minority political parties who's electoral slates do not get to vote for the president due to the Electoral College. Popular vote is the only reasonalble system for electing a president who will do their best for the American people. ""Of the people, for the people"". So let the all the people Vote.

Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because citizens are not voting for their president they are voting for a slate of elector how will pick the president for them.

Citizins are givin the rights to vote. The electoral collage is a way of taking voting away from them. Why would someone want to vote if they are not going to be able to vote for a president of their like. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what they might call the disastor factor. The electoral collage is also unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning president candidate.

What is voting to a citizin? Isint voting a right for citizens to vote for their president of their choice? Why take it away from them with the electoral collage. If you look at it from an american citizen prospective its like they dont even have a word when choosing their president. What di Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on? they agreed on abolishing the electoral collage! According to a Gallup poll in 2000 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct elections.

The Electoral College is an unamerican, and unfair voting process. In America we believe in the people living in our country having the right to vote for their leaders, but what if they're not directly voting themselves? The electoral college is an inacurrate way of determining the leaders of our country compared to the other actually accurate way of voting, a direct vote election. The method of The Electoral College cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. This doesn't seem exactly the way things are supposed to be in our nation since ""...over 60 perecnt of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""(source 2), does it?

Though it is highly unlikely that a choosen elector from a state would not vote towards the chosen side their state decided and voted upon, they still have the opportunity to. This opporitunity is unfair to the voters of the state as they are not directly voting for the president, such as how things are in a direct vote. A direct vote allows the candidate to be choosen and voted for directly by voters knowladgebly voting, then the highest popularity perecentage from votes are then to have the candidate be elected, not by a group of people that have a chance to be bias from the voters in their state. This problem can occur by things such as state legislatures picking electors that may not vote in favor of the states population's choice, but their and state legislatures choice. Even though ""...almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis,..""(source 3) not all states electors must do so. They can and have the chance to choose whoever they want as the power to pick is in their hands, and out of ours.

In smaller states such as Hawaii and Alaska they are only given a total of 3-4 electoral college votes as their population is not as large as somewhere such as California, New York or Florida. This does not only matter due to the low number of votes awarded, but it also effects how much they may know about the candidates running for the position. A lot of candidates only choose to go to ""swing"" states (California, New York, etc.) in order to recieve more votes in the electoral college. ""...candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning,..""(source 2) this causes a lot of people in areas not visited to be unknowledgable about eligible candidates in the voting process, and what they could be voting for. These ""swing"" states help candidates reach their goal of the winning 270 majority votes out of the 538 possible. 538 may seem like a large number but compared to the population of the United States its not really all that large of a group of people. The population of our nation and the votes of our voters is much more larger then the decisions of 538 electors.

Now hopefully it is clearer to see the many problems of the current electoral college system, as it is unfair and irrational. Our nation's voters are the ones who should be voting in a direct vote in picking the president compared to the electoral college. As the method of the electoral college cannot always be controlled by the voters from their state, and is unfair to states with lower populations whereas the population of that state might not understand what exactly they're voting for. These are only a couple of the large problems caused by the electoral college. As far as these problems I believe as Bob Dole said: Abolish the electoral college!

842888D759E2,"Most people might suggest to keep the electoral college work. Yet some other people don't. The method ""Winner-Takes-All"" is only fair enough, because why should the person who lost earn a reward , the people made their desicions, and whoever lost, goes back home.

Keeping the Electoral College also avoids problem of election, because once the votes are in, and they count the votes, there are no more talking but to accept the winner.

Winner Takes All, when competing in for election, its not right to share your reward with the opposing component. Once you win, you take it all. when election comes and the citizens vote, ""They are likely to be most thoughtful voters, on average(and for the further reasom that they will have recived the most information and attention from the candidiates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" (source#3, paragraph 20). Although people may disagree and say ""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the""swing"" states.""(source#2, paragraph 13).

FC9536F9B494,"Dear state senator,

Hello my name is PROPER_NAME and I am writing to you about our voting system. Many individuals are not content with the Electoral College and many are. You could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. Here are a few reasons on why the Electoral College method is the way to go.

During election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a ""tie"". A tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. In the Electoral College system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. Yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. As stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the wnning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote. It is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.

Article three line twenty-two reads "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."". One example of this is in 1968 Nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the Electoral College. Another example is in 1992 when Clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the Electoral College. Source three line twenty-three states "" It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.."". This is true but the Electoral College is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.

The Electoral College eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. The winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. The case in the popular vote method is very different.

Over all you can see that the Electoral College method is the way to go. There are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. There are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids run-off elections. We should not switch to the popular vote method.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
850401568E9C,"I have an opinion that I know others will agree with extremely. By popular vote, we should change the election process to The People voting directly. According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn't fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. ""They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election. We should be able to vote directly ourselves and not have electors do it for us. How do we know we can trust them? Yes, they're a part of our government, but that doesn't mean a thing.

The Electoral College was originally founded to be exactly what it is today; a vote that is held in Congress that is made by popular vote by citizens. But it has changed more than you think.  In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second  article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won't agree with it and they'll go against the votors decisions. This isn't the right thing, obviously. I'm sure that no one knows for a fact that's true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote. This country is about freedom and the right to do what we'd like, as long as it's rational. This is not rational. We need to be able to vote independentley.

There are many things wrong with this aspect of our government. Even though people don't think much of it, we're being treated unfairly. In the second article, in paragraph 2, Plumer (the author) makes a very good point. ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This makes us realize that we don't know who, for a fact, the electors are. It also shows that we don't know who the electors will vote for. Usually, they would probably vote for the person that were made to vote for.

None of us know what goes on in the Electoral College. We don't know if they vote for who we tell them to vote for. We don't know if they practically cheat us from getting the president we want. In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. ""After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Cerificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.""  This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want. As I have said through this whole letter, we deserve to directly vote for our President. This isn't fair to us or the person we want elected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

8B279CAD9DB6,"The electoral college system has been part of America for many years. At times, this system has proved to be a good thing for our country, but in most times, it has not. I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I am in favor of changing to a popular vote because of the unfairness, faulty aspects, and electors in the electoral college.

To begin, the electoral college is fair in some ways, but mostly not. One may understandably say that ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (Posner, 22). The electoral college has proved to be a balance to the political weight of the large states, but regardless of the size of the state, it should be a citizen right to vote directly for their president. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer, 13). This quote shows the unfairness to the voters, those in the smaller/more insignificant states don't even matter because of the electoral college! When voting, citizens also become confused with the electors, and potentially vote for their opposing party. Not only is the electoral college unfair for the voters, but for the presidental canidates as well. We as citizens vote for electors whom we must entrust to vote for the party's nominee. This trust is rarely betrayed, but ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral bote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner, 16). In 2000, the election with Al Gore and George Bush, Gore won the popular vote, but did not win the electoral vote. The people wanted Gore to be the president, but he did not win, due to the unfairness of the ellectoral college.

Another reason I am in favor for the popular vote, is because of the faulty aspects of the electoral college system. A counterargument may be that the electoral college has held our country together, making the voting system a lot easier. But in my opinion this is not true. With popular vote, the citizens would just vote for the president, and whichever canidate recieves the most votes would win. But in the case of the electoral college, states cast only one vote for the entire state! "".. the single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California"" (Plumer, 12). The reason this is such a big deal is because, let's say that 10,000 people voted in Wyoming. 5,001 were republicans, and 4,999 were democrats. The electoral college would pick the elector representing the republican candidate. Thus, Wyoming's vote goes to the republican canidate. Without the ellectoral college though, those 4,999 votes would count, and would go toward helping the desired canidate win. Voting is an individual effort, and the electoral college does not allow for this.

As well as this fault, another fault is the fact that the electors could be anyone. ""They can be anyone not holding public office... Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer, 10). Although in most cases the electors vote for the correct party, an elector still may not be trustworthy, or loyal. They may even be bias and vote for a different candidate. The electors do not campaign. Only the presidental canidates do. When we vote for the president, we are actually voting for the electors. Voters normally know little, to nothing about the electors. This makes for an even faultier voting experience.

To conclude, electoral colleges are not the way the voting system should be. With popular voting, there will be an assurance that the right candidate will win, the unfair ways of the ellectoral college will be diminished, and there will no longer be any faulty aspects of the voting system. Citizens vote to be heard, and with the electoral college, the people aren't heard as loud as they should be. Voting is a right and priveledge of an American citizien, and popular voting will ensure this right.    ",6,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
8D3CFD31B4EE,"The invention of the Electoral College has definitely altered the United States of America. According to past experiences and news broadcasts, it seems like the Electoral College is the right way to go. The Electoral College is elected to vote for the president that they plan to vote for, and it has a huge impact on the outcome of the election. Many do argue of course that the establishment of the Electoral College the population of America not have much say as oppose to the president that they wish to be in office for a full 4 years. Although the Electoral College causes minor problems, it is definitely the way to go and decide who the next man in charge of the nation will be.

According to Source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" written by Richard A. Posner, the author is for sure for the fact that the Electoral College is thw right way to vote for president. Richard gives some valid points throughout his essay and really did convince me to stay with the decision of keeping this system. One of them explains that voters in toss-up states are more likely to know what the campaign is really going towards and what the candidates believe could turn the nation around and make it a better one. They are the most thoughtful and have the most impact on the election for sure.

Futhermore, another reason why the Electoral College should stay as the primary system is because it is sure that it will decide the outcome of a presidential election. In 2012, Barack Obama has received 61.7 percent of all total votes according to the electors, which has decided the winner of the election. It is said that one vote can overturn the election if the voting is really close. In Source 1: ""What Is the Electoral College?"", each state is selected with a number of electoral voters each election and is responsible for the voting of their party. This is the way it should be, a group of voters of each state represent the state and cast an overall vote for the next president.

As many would say, ""we dont have any say in the election"", they are technically wrong. As the people of the state, citizens have the opportunity to elect for and decide on who should be the electors of the president. The people rely on the electors to vote for the president that they think should be in charge of the nation. Will this be the method of coosing the president in the next few decades or even centuries? Who knows? Maybe the government will establish a new form of voting that everyone will be glad about.

E2352C94F999,"Dear Senator,

I strongly suggest that you keep the Electoral college because of the different benefits it has to offer. It creates more of a certain outcome. Also, it is a way to avoid run-off elections. Even though there may be some negative outcomes to this way of voting, I feel that the advantages overlook them.

The Electoral college is a good method of our voting system in the United States because it helps to develop a more certain outcome. According to the passage titled

In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner, it states that ""Because almost all states award electoral votes ona winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" This tell that vote is plenty more certain using this method rather than to go by popular vote. With having a more percise and oranized plan of voting it garintees a more certain outcome and will prepare for problems that may occur such as ties in the election. The Electoral College is most definitley a an great voting method when used for certainty.

Another reason why The Electoral College is a great method of voting is because it is a way to avoid run-off elections. According to the same article titled

In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner it tells that ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which in variably produces a clear winner."" An example of this stated in the article is ""Nixon in 19680and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College"". Avoiding these types of things is very important. If we didnt have this method we would still have to come up with some sort of method so that thing like run-offs don't happen. However, some people disagree with the electoral college because they feel that they aren't really voting for the candidate, it still needs to be used because to many thing can happen such as ties and run-offs that we would need to figure out in the long run.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important and needs to continue to be our voting method for the United States. Certainty of the votes outcome and avoiding run-off election are twp ways Electoral votes have helped us. Without this method we would have to be dealing with these issues in some other kind of way.                                                   ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College helps us by avioding run-off elctions, where the votes are too close to desside a clear winner. It does this by in most states the majority of the popular votes dessides where all the votes go.  ""That pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.""(Posner)  In the 2012 election the populor vote in Florida was very close and if the president was dessided form the popular vote Floride would have had little effect on the eletion, but since the Electoral College dessides the winner, Obama had tweinty nine more votes to his campaign.  ""Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all the winning presidental candidate.""(the Office of the Federal Register)

Some people may thing that the Electoral College sould be done away with so that the president can be dessided by popular votes.  If this were to happen then there would be the chance to have run-off elections, since there would be no clear winner if the votes were very close.  There would be the complete unbalance from state to state, Rhode Island would have little to no effect on the election, where as with the Electoral College it could be the state to choose the winner.

The Electoral College keeps it so that each state has a bigger impact on the election and saves us from run-off elections from a close number of votes.  If we didn't have the Electoral College in place then history would be different for better or for worse, but I think that the Electoral College should be here to stay.

7BBC565EFE33,"The Electoral College is a system that should no longer be used because it is based on an outdated system from the first years of our country's independence.  It would be much more beneficial to use the popular vote as the final vote.  One reason is that one canidate can get more votes, but still lose the election! Another is that many states never get to see the potential president speak, as to make their descion.  Lastly voting would be easier to count and to understand for citizens and those who work the election.

In 2000, the electoral college failed to properly represent our country's people.  More people voted for Al Gore, but Bush still won the election.  In the states where Bush did win, it made the people who voted for Al Gore insignificant and their votes would never again be considered.  Even if in every state a paticular canidate won by one vote, that person would still get every electoral vote, because they won the state, this is mostly an issue in large states.  This is unfair to the losing canidate because their voters never really got a chance.  If it was a popular vote, voting would be much more direct and easier to understand.  Citizens might even be unaware that they aren't really voting for the president, they are voting for their electoral college representative.  With popular vote, there would be no more confusion, and no more worrying about comparing the two voting methods.

Another reason is that some states may never get a chance to see their potential president speak.  Potential presidents tend to go speak in swing states, or states that may vote either for them or for their opponent, since it is based on the states vote not the individual people.  When a president goes to speak in a swing state they are convincing people that it will be a better choice to vote for them, not the other canidate.  If somebody lived in Rhode Island, for example, they would never get the chance to see their potential president speak, therefore they would have to make their descion based on television speeches, newspaper articles, etc.

Also states that tend to vote one way or another often do not get visited because there is no point in trying to convince a state to vote for you that is definitley already going to vote you, to vote for you, and vice versa.  Swing states with high populations are really the only states that are visited.  It is no promise that the potential president will go to every state or even every region, but they will more likely than not visit different states than they would have before.  If popular vote decided who would become president, it likely would no longer be true for presidents to only visit swing states.

Last, the entire election process would be much more simplistic.  There would be a whole group of people who no longer would have to be a part of the process, and the less people, the less mistakes.  Also each state could still add up their votes, then add all the state's votes together and voila, the president has been chosen, by the people.  There would be no more arguments as to who really won the election, as in popular vote versus electoral college.  Also there would be much less of a chance for a tie, the more numbers the less each number is worth.  Overall, the electoral college adds unecessary complications to a potentially simple system.

The popular voting system would still be difficult to take care of, but much better than the previous system, the despised electoral college.  Throughout the years we have seen twice where our course of history could have been radically changed, with a different president.  The popular vote system would increase the power of the people, allow more people to see the president speak, and get rid of unecessary complications and confusion of the electoral college.

I beleive that we should throw out the electoral colledge and not use it anymore. Today it is irrelevant and it does not help out the elections, in fact I think it only causes trouble.

The electoral colledge is the last deciding factor of who acuatlly gets president. How is that a democracy? The people vote for who they want to in the main election and then by popular vote is usually what party gets to send the electors that would vote for them(source 1 ph 5-8). An example of this is the famous 2000 election. That election Al Gore and George Busch were facing off fo the right to hold office. Now Al Gore had won by popular vote, but instead what happened is the electoral colledge voted in favor of Busch instead of Al Gore(posner  ph16). So this shows that Gore should have won because he had the most votes by the american people, but then the electoral colledge voted someone else. So why did the people even vote if the person they wanted in office did not even make it in. That is why we should do away with the electoral colledge.

Now if for some reason the majority voted in a really crazy man into office that would completely corupt the government then it would be good too have something else that can change teh vote so that America does not get anymore corrupted. The only problem is how many times would you vote for a crazy person who you know will affect you in a very major way? My guess is not very often.

Now there is some perks but they are really only for the losing president. If the pesident did not win all of the popular vote he could have won a lot more swing states than his opponent which help him better in the electoral election(posner ph20). So there is only one way that the electoral colledge is helpful and it is not even to the American voters. This is why we need a change and to get rid of the electoral colledge.

So in conclusion, I have shared many reasons why the electoral colledge needs to go. I hope that you mull over these ideas and that you bring them to the governments attention.

C6DE30757F46,"Dear State Senator,

There are many issues concerning the Electoral College and whether to keep it or changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  The Electoral College is very important considering it has educated canadates.  The people do not understand that the United States has many uneducated people.  They do not realize that if there is no Electoral College, the people with education will vote to directly decide the president, but so will the uneducated people.  The Electoral College wants the best for our country and is trying to benifit the USA, not cause it harm.

Though the Electeral College is a benefit and means no harm, it does have its flaws.  Many people when they vote for example, a democratic representative, they expect the democratic representative to vote for the democratic canadate for president.  Unfortununtly, sometimes that is not the case.  The democratic representative will end up voting for the Republican canadate for president.  This issue occurs many times in the Electoral College which is why people are having second thoughts about the Electoral College and wanting to eliminate it so that they can directly vote for the president or vice president they want and think will improve our country more.

The Electoral College is benefitcial because it is educated people trying to figure out by anallyzing and concluding who will represent and run our country the best way possible.  In the first article, it says ""MOST states have the ""winner-takes-all"" system"", but in the second article it says ""Because of the winner-take-all system in EACH state"".  In the second article, one of the arguments as to why the Electoral College should be abolished is incorrect due to the fact that not every state has the ""winner-takes-all"" system.  Since they got imformation wrong, people can not count this article as a reliable source of information.

Our counrty has been doing very well compared to the other countrys like Korea, Africa, Cuba, China, and etc.  People should just be grateful and apperciative that the United States is doing as well as it is doing.  The Electoral College is a benifit and it should not be abloished or eliminated from congress, but it should be improved.  We as americans should try to advance our country in every way possible, not eliminate something if it does not go our way.  We should try to cooperate and improve on the mistakes to make our country better and progress everyday so that today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow better than today!

I think we should keep the Electoral College. It's been with us for a very long time, passed down from our founding fathers. They establish the Electoral College in the Constitution for a reason. There is no need for us to get rid of it. It's been helping us choose the right president for this country for decades. Sure the popular vote is important too but I think the Electoral College is more helpful and here is why.

The electoral votes know more about who and what they are voting for. Because they pay more attention to the campaign than the people. It also helps with close or an even amount of the popular votes so it could break the tie even though it is unlikely we can always have the Electoral College to decide. Sometimes when people vote they don't even know who to vote for and could just check the box they see a name for. They don't know what the elective could do for the future of America. Some also vote for certain electives because someone told them too or because someone else voted for that elective. Some candidates go and try to win increase his or her plurality and presuade the people of certian states that they know they'll win to become president instead of trying to get all the states too vote for him or her. Which won't be that sucessful of a president as stated in paragraph 19. Candidates focus their campaign on the toss-up states because they know what they are voting for. Which adwards electoral votes to the candidate. Popular votes helps by letting the candidate get more electoral votes because of the winner take all basis as said in paragraph 18.

That is why I think we should keep the Electoral College. It helps out with a lot of things. It has helped us for many years and have gave us great presidents for America. It makes the method of choosing a president easier too. Hopefully the Electoral College will stay with America for a long time.                                                                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
7A033CA12FEE,"Dear senator,

I highly suggest you to reconsider about voting for that particular president. There might be quite a few people that voted for that person. Also there is a lot of people that like the other canidate. Most of the people that are not eligable to vote would want you to make the right choice.

Now that most states have a winner take all system it is not very fair for all the people in one state just to go to one person. It is the right thing to do to get all of the people in one state just to vote for the canidate that they want to take over the oval office. It would be a better system and would have less of a possible risk just to get a tie in the ellectoral college.

So i highly regard this letter just to let you know that changing the way of voting would make a big deal to all of the country. It would benefit the whole country that every person could make a big difference in the elections of modern society. In the future we will have what is called chaos in the voting polls. None of the voting will matter because the electors will get to decide who will be president.

Scincerely,

The only way to effectivly do this, is to get rid of the electoral collage. The electoral collage is not nessacary because they just over ride the peoples votes in thier own way when the president has hired them to represent him.

According to Bradford Plumer in paragraph 10,he states ""Under the electoral collage system voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" In this here we see that the citizens dont have much of of a say, but even if some say that this is not true, It would be very minimal when it come to how much of a diference it would make. it just goes to show how much the electoral collage is not needed.

Just because of this, thing can get very confusing when it comes to voting. As bradford plumer states in paragraph 10 as well,""Can voters control whom thier electors vote for? not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? sometimes."" in this we can tell the conusion that the electoral collage may cause and once again, how it effects our vote for the canidate.

The electoral collage is difficult to be considered nessacary. not only because it may make voting a little difficult, but for the more important reason, we hve no say in what we vote. As citizens we should be able to have our voince heard. It is very important to select who will be your leader. this is why the electoral collage is not nessacary.                       ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
BACC53ECC1FB,"Dear Florida Senator,

Would you like to vote, or do you feel obligated to vote? I personally want my vote to make a difference. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it expess others to vote and to have freedom of speech of knowing which candidate would be better to control our world of which we live in.  If you are willing to vote, choose carefully and be percise with your answer. Don't let others get in your way, it's your choice and time, so express a political preference rather than deciding an election.

First of all, voting is all about the candidates, try to understand and know the candidates before voting. ""Voters sometimes get confused about the elctors and vote for the wrong candidate."" If you didn't know the candidates and voted the wrong candidate, then your vote may make a difference and you would have to wait patiently for four years intill your able to vote again for a different candidate.

Secondly, If you don't want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference, then I'm sure others feel the same way. ""A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does."" Every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state, and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions.

Thirdly, Candidates should think about their electors and keeping this world safe and sercure for us rather than just wanting to be in the white house. ""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" It's great that the candidates are appreciative by the electors and wanting our vote to count.

In conclusion, we cannot control electors who wants to vote for a candidate that others may dissagree on, but we can control our own vote.

It's your decision whether to vote or not and who do you approve for. Your vote can make a difference and every bit counts. So there is a reason to have the Electoral College.         ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

MONTH_DAY_YEAR

In this essay I will be explaining why the Electoral College shouldn't be kept,and why we should do a popular vote instead to determine the president of the United States.

In my opinion we should do a popular vote because we U.S. citizens know what we want. The Electoral College may know what they want for themselves as a unit but honestly I think that the United States should stick to a popular vote. In an article I read called ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it states that state legislatures can technically be picking electors that will always defy the will of the people. I notice this to be very unfair because if electors are always going to defy what we say and want why should we vote. Isn't one of America's #1 catch phrases ""

power to the people

"" well in this case it seems to be ""

power to the Electoral Collage

"". In this article it also states that in many cases  ""

faithless

"" electors have ocassionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please! So if the electors can choose for whomever they please why can't we. I also think that the Electoral College is unfair because of the winner-take-all system. Candidates don't have to spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. While they go to the states that they know they have a absolute chance of winning in and take those winning votes. So in this case I have to agree with Bob Dole: Abolish the Electoral College!

I also think its wrong that voters can't always control who their voting for because we all the freedom to our own opinions and in the process of the Electoral Collage they are basically just throwing all opinions in the trash. They obviously don't care and I see this as completely irrational and unfair. I know that may use the Elecotoral Collage as a way to keep everyone calm but I think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain. I also consider the Electoral Collage electors high class. So in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them, I think this is unfair to the lower-income families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lower-income families how are they going to live? How are they going to survive.""Remember ""

So the goverment wants to tell you that you need to be a citezen to vote but what are you voting for? The electoral college is a fraud, your supposed to send your personal opinion to vote for the president of your country, not some lazy bum that sits in a chair all year and when time comes to put his vote in he overides yours and the peoples votes for you and not even care because they are getting paid to?

It only takes two hundered and seventiy votes from the electoral college to elect the president when theres over two billon residents in the united states? You mean to call this a demcracy when its really a underground dictator ship. I dont know how hard it is to bribe a person in a high postion but it is hard to bribe a whole country and thats why I belive we should get to actually vote for the next presdent theres no trust into the peoples belifes i mean yes theres alot of bandwagon fans and people who really have no idea of whats going on in their country but i promise you we wont fool around and compirmise the whole system beliving in our own belifes!!! these fancy bosos mignht thuink they know what their doung but they really dont there just a bunch money thisrty pigs and it isnt fair to the people to rely on theb electoeral college to pick the fate of our country as long as we live on it

The fact that we cant even pick the electors make it even worse i mean how are we even supposed to trust them i dont know who they are do you? how do you know what the legislators a caplble of they could have been bribed and no one would even know i mean the goverment already has alot of secterts and they could be asdding on the them and you wouldnt evem knowwhy beacuse its the goverment there broken up into little pieces of fruadery its incredibly anoyying to know that if you even try t fight about the rights of a cietzen you'll lose not even having to walk into the court room because the goverment runs that too!!!

F1A43B355944,"In my personal oppinion I think it's best to keep the Electoral College. Don't get me wrong I think people should have a say in it too, but in all seriousness we the people we really can't make good decisions. For instance what they say may blind us from the hard on facts and we'll make a horrible decision just because they can manipulate us with words. The Electoral College can pick the person that is perfect for the job but we can't.

""A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Posner) It states there that if the person is popular in some sates and everybody likes him, that doesn't mean he would be fit to be president. The Electoral College doesn't pick them because of what they say and if they persuide you to like them, they look at the facts and see if that person is fit to be the president. Maybe it's best if they were to decide on the president but I'm also saying that we should have some say in it.

We're the ones living here we all have a right too. It doesn't matter if we make poor decisions we're only human that's what we do, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a say in it. ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Bradford Plumer) Sure the Electoral College doesn't normally decide on what we have to say but they should take it in consideration.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College and let the proffessionals do what they do best. As the people living with what the president has to say I still think it's highly important that we have some say on who the president is. Will we make the right decisions? probably not but we're only human can you blame us? No I didn't think so.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
4B9D1AD02B40,"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democratic(Plumer-Paragraph-9).

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privaleges. A poll of over 6/10 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be contreversal though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the contreversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. Kennedy(Plumer-Paragraph-10-11)

There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronism(Posner-Paragraph-15). If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
44564292521C,"Politicians and the public have argued for years over one burning question: Should the Electoral College be discontinued? I believe the Electoral College should not be used in the United States anymore. To understand the faults within this system, one must understand the system at its basic level. The Electoral College is a system that consists of 538 electors. Each state has a different amount of electors, granted on the size of that state's population. When the election is held, the voter votes for the electors, not the candidate directly.

The first fault one can find while examining this system is the ""winner takes all"" policy that most states have. In paragraph seven of the first souce, the article states, ""Most states have a ""winner-takes-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate."" This system seems unfair, especially in states where the vote for electors is won by a small margin. The votes cast for the candidate who lot the electoral votes in their state are not counted in choosing the president, which hinders the ideals of democracy in this country. In paragraph nine of the second source, the article reads,"" according to a Gallup poll in 200, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This crisis in 2000, when George W. Bush won the electoral college, but Al Gore won the popular vote, displays the lack of clarity with this system. This election was a prime example that the president is not chosen by the popular voice, but rather by the Electoral College, which does not accurately represent everyone.

The second fault with Electoral College stems from the first issue: people are not voting beacuse they feel as if their voice is not being heard. Stated as a counterargument in paragraph 23 of source three, the article states, ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method...may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state - Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" People are choosing not to vote because they feel as if their voice is being shadowed by the major polictical thinking in their state, and this mindset corrupts the institution of democracy in the United States.

An argument made by those in favor of the Electoral College can found in paragraph 20 of source three, ""Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign...They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average and the most thoughtful voters shoule be the ones to decide the election."" This argument is opinionated and has no substantial evidence behind it. According to source 2 in paragraph 13, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This was due to the candidates spending their time, money, and efforts to win over ""swing states"", the states that could go either Republican or Democrat depending on the candidates that year.

The Electoral College is a system that should not be used anymore because it does not properly consider the opinions of all voters, turns away voters who believe they will not have their voices heard, and leave states without seeing ads or candidates during the election because these candidates are trying to win over other states.            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people. People should be able to vote for the president they want and not have electors elect the president. If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

39568660BDA5,"I dont think that the electoral college should decide the president of the united states, i think that the overall vote of the americans should determine the president of the unites states. I have certain reasons, and a good explanation of why the popular vote matters way more than the electoral vote first is why would they even have a popular vote if there not gonna go by it? Also the popular vote has mostly everyone in the united states voting on it, the electoral vote has only a couple people, they are way outnumbered. And lastly its not fair at all to the american people.

Firstly, why would you want the whole united states of america to vote on something if what they vote, and what they say isnt being heard. Whats the point of it? in my opinion what the people say how the president should be determined. If they want it any other way why would they not have changed it by now? no one really likes having to take time out of there day to go vote, if there votes arnt even going to be seen, or heard by people? whats the point of making them do that?

Secondly, the united states has billions of people in it, and the electoral college only has a few people in it. You think thats very fair to anybody ??? everyone votes, results are in, you think you have a winner, then all of a sudden theres no winner, you know why? because of the electoral college!!! these extra people make the final decision and thats not right. If thats the case of it to me it seems like they have the answers, and no one can decide but them, so why even have a vote? its really pointless the author states that most states like the idea that the overall vote wins, theres only a couple that dont like this idea. So by rule they should just make it the popular vote wins the election, and thats who tthe president becomes. Why they havnt done it? I have no idea!

And my final reason of why popular votes should just determine who wins is because they go out and vote and they feel like it doesnt matter. Because the electoral college decides then the united states gets really mad when they vote and the popular vote doesnt win! Of course they get mad, who wouldnt? there votes mean nothing at all. And they need to change this electoral college policy, more people want it gone thaen the people that dont. And thats mostly why america is usually never satisfied with the president of the unites states. Because of the fact that the united states didnt put them and the votes first, they put the electoral college ahead and thats not how it needs to be!!! They should make a vote for the united states saying that who wants to keep the electoral college and who doesnt! i bet that they will say that they want it gone. Because its already been voted out before so why will they keep something that no one is satisfied, or pleased with? Hopefully they will see this soon enough!!!

In conclusion, this electoral college stuff just needs to go, and the people need to be happy with there vote that they want, and they should be! they have been living in the state there whole life, if not most of it. And they want to make sure that someone they like, and know and trust will be there leader and wont let them down, and will change the problems that are in america. So go ahead and keep the electoral college even if barely any one likes it. Cause that doesnt make any sesnse!!!! the people need to vote on there counties leader not a few people for each state, and or place. its not right, and no one really likes it.

1D55D4FF63BE,"Dear state senator,

I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral college because, it requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal,its actually a good thing. Basically all voters are involved because if it wasnt for that one voter the president wouldnt had been elected as president. A candidate with only one regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. if we didnt have voters we might would have the worst president of them all, he could do bad things for the country he want, which may affect us as a country. Dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College votye is possible is because, the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Another reason, is that the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitutuion .Large states such as florida , wyoming, gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small states does. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote . yet that has happened very rarely. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that is rarely betrayed.

in addition, We can have argue that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off the potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for their state . They have to be more careful about who they want to vote because, it can cause alot of damge to the president or even the world that we live in. They should let people who already know about the political party's and the democrats and the republicans.

to be continued, We should have our background checked on if we should vote or not because , people have faked thier identity and voted , or even forced someone else to vote for them even if they didnt want to. the electoral college is a very important process that goes on in this world just to make our place a better one . If our electoral college do better we can have more oppertunities in life, like when the good president becomes president just like obama , He can do good things with the taxes or even make it easier for kids to have jobs so they wont have to be on the streets doing bad things and maybe even one day they would grow up to be able to vote for thier favoritem president.

The electoral college is a proccess that contains counting of electoral votes by Congress, selection of the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for Vice President and President. Keeping the electoral college college isn't a good idea because when voting the the people vote electors and not for a presidential candidate, and voters sometimes get confused about electors. Many people disagree and agree whether to keep the electoral college but its thier opinion.

When voters vote they vote for a slate of electors not for the president. Many people dont want to vote for a elector. They want to vote for a president because that is the main reson that they are voting. If people vote for electors then thier hopes might get down.

49F5B4EA2690,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a system that the United States has been using to elect its leaders for many years. A large number of people have come to believe that this method of voting is fraud because not everyone's vote is truely heard. The way the Electoral College works is every four years when people go to vote, people are not actually voting directly for their desired leader, but for a state elector. Although this sounds like it would work flawlessly in theory, in some cases the number of electoral votes have overridden the number of popular votes.

In the 2000 election between Bush and Gore, Bush ended up winning even though Gore received more popular votes. The nation did not know who the President was going to be until the next year becuase the election came down to only a couple of hundred votes. Although this is a rare occurance it shows how easily the Electoral College can wrongly choose a President. If the United States elected a President by taking a popular vote, this issue would not exist. All of the extra systems that are put in place are simply not needed.

If the Electoral College was removed and the United States voted in leaders based on the national popular vote, this means that there would also be more people voting. Many people, especially in one sided states such as Texas and California, believe that their vote does not count becuase they're state is guarenteed to favor one party every election. If the Electoral College did not exist then knowing that every individual vote counts and that it does not matter where you live, more people are actually going to listen to what candidates have to say and are going to go out and vote.

In Conclusion, although the Electoral College may sound good in theory, I believe that the United States voting system would be more legitimate if a national popular vote was taken so that everyone's voice is heard no matter where they live. Voters should be able to know that they're vote will count so that the right leader is chosen for the right reason.                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

""The Electoral college is a process not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" I do not thing think this is the best method of voting on the next President for our Country.

Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for the President but for a slate of electors. The election process should be changed to ""election by popular vote.""

Another reason I think we shouldn't use the electoral college is because some states are biased towards certain political groups so say California wanted a democrat to be President that person would recieve 55 electoral votes from just one state! Many states that don't have as many electoral votes may not even get to see the canidates because they only care about the larger states. For instance, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The third reason I think we should let the outcome be decided by the American people and not electoral colleges is because the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California.

In conclusion, I think that the Electoral College should be abloished because the deciding factor for who becomes President comes from the electoral college, states can be biased towards certain political groups, and because its just simply unfair, outdated, and irrational just like Bob Dole said!

A8411CE08C68,"The president of the United States should be decided by the Electoral College process, not by most popular vote. There are many reasons why we should keep the way we vote the same.

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

We definatly need to continue using the Electoral College process. The most popular vote process wouldn't be an ideal way to elect a president.    ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
B237EA09433F,"The Declaration of Independence granted us the right to control our government. Thomas Jefferson once stated, ""When a nations government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of its people to abolish it and establish a new government."" After viewing the articles Source 1:""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and  Source 3:""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner it seems clear that the Electoral Colleges have lessened the power of the people in our nation. With the Electoral College method of selecting our nations new president the people of our nation become less empowered, they may cast their vote but the choice of president is never truly theirs. The Electoral Colleges drive people away from voting because they see the election as if their vote will not matter. To further empower the citizens of the United States the Electoral Colleges should be abolished.

Throughout our nations history the majority vote has lost due to being outvoted when it comes to Electoral Colleges. Because of the majoity vote losing out to Electoral Colleges, people have come to believe their vote will not matter in the long run. In Source 2 Plumer declares, ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate"". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate"". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented.

Electoral Colleges do not reflect the democratic style of government we have had for hundreds of years. In Source 3 Posner states, ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"". Ever since the United States has been around our lifestyle has been purely democratic. The people are supposed to the empowering body of our government and their voice is the one that should be heard. But since we have the Electoral College the voice of the people has become muffled. No longer is the presidential election a democratic event, but one that is decided through the votes of only a few chosen American citizens. Plumer observed in Source 2 that, ""During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the canidates at all"". If the people of America are truly part of our governing body then they must see the canidates and hear what they have to say. The Electoral College has driven canidates away from states that will not have much say. These states are then left to make a decision for themselves and decide based on their personal preference, they are never able to truly hear what these canidates may or may not have to offer.

On the other hand, Electoral Colleges do have a lack of uncertainty. As Posner said in Source 3, ""the dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likey than a dispute over the popular vote"". The Electoral College provides the American people with a certainty of outcome. Whenever a state decides where its Electoral votes are going the canidate typically wins by a landslide electoral-vote victory.

Although the Electoral College has a few appealing qualities, it is mostly an unfair system for the United States. The colleges should not have the power to decide the president, that should be the people that reside in the country's choice. Thomas Jefferson spoke of the people taking control of their country's government and the citizens of America should do just that if they are ever to escape the grasp of the Electoral Colleges.

17E173734A16,"Dear Mr.Senetor,

My name is PROPER_NAME. The Electoral College is a great way to choose the President, but at the same time it isn't because it's not fair for everyone. That is why i believe the Electoral Collge system should be no more.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" It's not only not fair to the voters, but it also isn't fair to the people trying to campaign to be President. Everyone should have the opporitunity to run for President. They may have something meaningful to say and you never know if they actually have the potential to be the President or not if you don't give them a chance.

""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states...Voters in the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing they are going to decide the election."" Yes, the toss-up states like Florida or California are most likely to be more recognized and listened to, but it is not fair to the ""swing"" states. They are just as good as the people who want to be President in the other states, too. Do you think it is fair that a man in Oklahoma is running for President, but no one is paying attention to him because he lives in a state that is rarely mentioned? No! He deserves a chance too!

So in conclusion the Electoral system may be great but, your vote should be counted also. It shouldn't only get to be the electors decision on who gets to be President, but it also shouldn't be based off the more known states. Give other states, ""swing"" states, a chance too. That is why i say the electoral system should be no more.

Thank you for your time.

D52ADC09CF36,"First of all, the Electoral College is regarrded as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be over powered by declaring the canidate who gets the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does. Most people vote for a presidant just because everyone else did, his/her race, his/her gender, and other things like that. Voting for that presidant with no knowlage about them or what they are capable of. But people tend to vote for that president out of majority because if 50% of the largest state voted ""yes"" for this president then we vote for him and then he/she is now president and is not doing anything right and they think that if you take away this or you do that it will solve the problem. But it won't, it'll only make things worse and upset a lot of people.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors ? They can be anyome not holding public office. Sometimes statee conversations, sometimes the presidential candidates themsleves.

722F0DECA31C,"Dear Senator,

I wrote this letter to tell you we should keep the electoral college process. I know you must get hundredths of letters everyday about this,but it is a very important topic to discuss. We did it this way every since the founding fathers created it. Most people wouldnt understand that,but this is a process on witch are nation grow up on learning. Its kind of amazing that we still remeber this way,and still continue to use it. This is just one of the reasons that have yet to come.

Also,wouldnt it be diffucult to just change the system out of thin air,think about it. You also have to think about the people who disagree with changing the system. People can stop voting if they dont like the system. If nobody votes,then are country cant move fourth into the future,and if that happens the USA mint have a civil war. From a diffrent stand point it mint not be a bad thing to get a new system. This is just another reason why we shouldnt change the system of voting.

The system we have now works,so what will be the point of changing something if it is not broken. The system we have now makes sure not one man has more power than the next man or woman. Think about the improving we have done to the current system,before blacks even couldnt vote into they improved the system. Back then their were alot of errors and stuff wrong with the process into they started improving. Now,why would you want to throw all that hard work away. This is just another why another why we shouldnt get rid of the current voting system.

We even made amedements to help enchance the system,without these amedments the power will be uneven. For instance if they didnt make a amedement to stop slavery then,blacks wouldnt even be able to vote. How bout they didnt make a amendment to give girls the right to vote then the power will still be shifted. You also cant forget how many people fought to make the power equal. If the power is shifted in the tighest a civil war can break out,and ruin what we worked so hard to protect. This was the last reason why we shouldnt chang the system.

All in all my letter was about how we shouldnt change the current system we have now. If we do all that hard work will go to waste. We spent so many years perfecting the system. Many people have fought to keep power in check bewteen people. If we made a new system it mint be worse then the system we have. That is why we shouldnt change the system.

A60D3B8ABD92,"Dear Senator, recently there has been much debate about whether the Electoral College should be retained or not. After reading the artices, it is very clear to me that the Electoral College has worked efficiently for many years and, therefore, should be kept as a way of voting for our country's president.

First of all, even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral college is quite possible, it is much less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Imagine if an argument broke out about the outcome of popular voting. There would be absolute chaos and too many different opinions. Even though many voters would argue that they prefer direct voting, the product of that would only overcomplicate the system and make things run less smoothly.

Secondly, the Electoral College should be kept because it restores the weight in the political balance that the bigger states lose by the virtues of the mal-apportionment of the Senate that was decreed in the supreme law of our country, the constitution. It also makes a tie highly unlikely.

Lastly, the system of the Electoral College helps to avoid the problem of run-off elections. There is a lot of pressure for elections in which no candidate gets a majority of the votes cast. If it were not for the Electoral College, that pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process. The Electoral College reduces the risk of a run-off election and produces an obvious winner. According to article three, since almost all states award the  electoral votes on a winner-takes-all basis, even the smallest plurality in a single state can create a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for tht party's nominee, and that trust is hardly ever betrayed. Some people argue that the Electoral College is unfair because because it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote may not win the national popular vote. Although that is true and it is possible, it is also incredibly rare. It happened once in 2000 in the election betweeen Bush and Gore, but that was the first time since 1888.

All in all, I believe the Electoral College has proven to be consistently successful in the history of our country. After all, it has given us great presidents and, hopefully, it will continue to do so in the future elections to come.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
694238280A93,"I think the Electoral college is a good way to vote for the president or vice president because i think without the Electoral college, we wouldn't have anyone to vote for the president or vice president. We have each candidate running for president in our state and it has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the candidate political party.

I agree that most state have a winner take all system because it awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College.

The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors.

I think the best laid defenses of the system are wrong because some voters might sometime vote for the wrong candidate and they might sometime get confused about the electors. After Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, he won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state.

The agruments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right. Abolish the electoral college.

I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

8D69369DEDA2,"The electoral college is a very important process in congress. It gives citizens that are in the college a chance to meet the people that will be running for a very powerful position. Sometimes voices arent heard and of these 528 people, some will be humble. its also a good thing that they use a majority ruling system, which can make things easier instead of detailing.

If the voting for election of president was changed to popularity vote only, then it wouldnt be quite as fair. Obviously the president who has apppeared more times on television or at meetings will win. This method screams unfairness. Whichever candidate has more money and funding will obviously become more popular, even if their intentions as president arent as good as the qualities the other candidate's are.

Although both methods by themselves seem a little unfair to work on, i say it would be better to work with both. If you leave it to the electoral college, then only those people will be able to have a say in who we want as president for the united states of america. However if we leave it to just popularity, whoever has more money will get the votes and win.

Some people say that the voice of the people in America is the most important and it really is. What is the point of being in charge of a country where no one is happy and everyone wants to get rid of you? By this standing pount, many people say its critical to use populartiy vote but as i stated before, whoever has more funding will win. But its also unfair to those who have less access to media. Whichever president they hear more about is the one they will unconsiously choose. Or some will rely on the trusting of their party ie. democratic or republican.

Both methods are extremely unfair by themselves, so we should not sigle out a voting process. The way we have it now works perfectly well and should not be changed in my opinion. Taking the overall amount for all the different categories seems like the perfect solution.

Avoiding Run-Off Elections is one good reason why we should keep the Electoral College according to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" It states that, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes.""

In the writing ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President."" and it states, ""The Electotoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" This is saying that go by a different rule of voting because of the population being than other states. Another good point is in the first paragraph again and it says ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."" This is good that you have a schedual for for the next voting this gives us enough time to vote, it also gives the time to see if the president is good or not.

There is some downsides to this little thing you have going on here though. That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them.

To wrap things up I am telling you that your Electoral College system is great in most ways. You should try and change some of those things that are bad about it though.

The Electoral Collge helps vote for the president of the United States because there is a certainty of the outcome, and the Electoral College are like presidents too. I support the idea of which keeping the Electoral College for the help in the presidential run.

Keeping the Electoral College is vital to the presidents because there is a certainty of the outcome. Richard A. Posner states: ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" This means that the Electoral College votes count more than the popularity votes for the upcoming president. For example, Richard A. Posner states that ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney..."" This means that the Electoral College votes are way more acounted for then the popular votes.

Aren't Electoral Colleges like presidents too? They help the presidents votes and help them make decisions also. Doesn't that sound like a president to you? The article states ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" says Richard A. Posner.

ABC9EBAB6670,"Electoral Congress

Have you ever wondered how the government adds up the votes and determinds who the president is after the election? the Electoral College is a process made in the Constitution, a compromise between the election by Congress and the election by citizens. Most would say that the Electoral College is reguarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic way of selecting a president. Like every other thing in the world, people form their own opinions. There are pros and cons to everything, even the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College is exactly what it sounds like. It is a group of highly educated people that come together every year during the presidental election and choose wisely who the want to become president and vice president. Once everyone is complete choosing who they select, they add them up and seperate them by each state. Keep in mind, each state only gets a certain number of electors, depending on how big the state is. For example, Florida, the state that I live in, gets 29 electoral votes, as to Hawii, which only gets four votes.

Next, the Electoral College has its pros and cons. One con of the College is they have more of an impact on the choosing of the president than the actual citizens have. You would think that the people, including both sides of the political parties, would have more of a say on whome becomes the president for the next four to eight years. For instance, multiple people and groups such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commence, And the AFL-CIO have said and agreed on, ""Abolishing the electoral college!"".

Lastly, we have many reasons why we keep the Electoral College. One reason is certainty of outcome, a president can have more citizen votes than the other, but the losing candidate can still win because of the electoral votes. Another reason this happens is because most states have a winner-take-all basis, meaning that the state chooses and the winning person with the most votes gets a state vote, even if you personally didn't vote for that person. Another reason why is because the U.S. has many larger states and the Electoral College balances it out for them.

So as you see, the Electoral College is debatable on whether or not it is a good or bad thing. They have pros and cons like everything else in the world.             ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Posner show the pros and cons of the Electoral College. The Electoral College should be taken over by popular votes because all Americans should have a say in who their next leader will be.

The Electoral College may disregard what their voters say and vote for another candidate to be our next President. In paragraph 11 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it is declared that ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate."" Voting citizens of America vote for a reason. They vote for who they want to be President, not who the party's electives want to be President. Voters should be able to trust their electors, otherwise their votes are going to a candidate they voted against. Another key point of this unjust way of voting is that people have to put their trust into unknown electors. It is stated in paragraph 16 of ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner ""each of the party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee."" These electors may be ""trusted"", but to the unknowing voters of America they are ordinary people who could betray someone very easily. All it takes is one elector disobeying his promise to the candidate he chose to represent to have the fate of American changed.

The winner of the election may lose by popular vote and win by electoral votes. This is an unfair advantage that the Electoral College has to the common voters. Voters expect to vote for who they selected, not who the Electoral College selects. It is empahsized in paragraph 10 of the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plummer in which ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" In simpler terms, this is saying you don't vote for the next leader, you vote for people who may choose the next leader. The people of America vote for a reason, to choose our next leader who will support our country. They don't vote to have a College of unknown Electors choose the next President. It should also be noted that you're techniacally not even voting for a President. It is disputed in paragraph six of ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" In other words, you don't even choose your candidate, just people who are trusted to vote for them. American voters want to for the nex president, not a board of Electors that they are unsure will trust them.

On the contrary, there is the possibilty of it being a very close election where it would require the Electoral College to choose a President. In paragraph 18 of the source ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Richard A. Posner states ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The popular vote might be back and forth between the Presidents, but an electoral vote would create more of a landslide win. In the end, the cons of the Electoral College outweigh the pros of it.

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing our country's next leader. The change of this ancient voting would be a very good and appreciatef one. If America really let the people of America choose, they would let the popular vote be the deciding factor for our next President of the United States.               ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I believe that the Electoral College should stay in process because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president.

Plus, they make sure the elector running, has good legitiment reasons for becomeing our countries representor. With the presidential election held every four years, the Electorial College can be still processing men, and women, who are wanting to represent our country. Furthermore, the state elector running for president, is assisted by our votes, because when you vote for your candidates, you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Once the presidential election is over, the staes governers start a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" witch list all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.       ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational as Bradford Plumber stated. First of all, The electoral college consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vise President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. We should abolish the electoral college because it is unfair to voters. It's all because of the winner-take-all system that in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all - 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

One of the best arguments against the electoral college is the disaster factor. The state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, segragationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to him.

Another issue that most people worry about is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives and the Senate would choose Vise President.

To say the least, abolishing the electoral college is the best idea. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, I am not alone. The Gallup poll was taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. How does the electoral college even have any defenderes left? Even in a close election in which the popular vote winner could lose the presidency.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism and I couldn't agree more. It is a thing from the past and should stay that way. The electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense because it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Richard A. Posner even says that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

6.16E+104,"Dear Senator of Florida,

What's recently been rated the most despised way of voting? Electoral college. It's outdated,unfair,and irrational. If the people are really voting why is it up to eletoral college to decide. I think giving the people the power to vote is a great idea,but popular vote should really be the decider of who gets to be the president Popular vote can be changed though,we could make it a safer and more truthful way of voting. We can live in space for months,discover all sorts of life forms, and so much more. Yet we keep advancing,it's about time for some change in voting. I think electoral college should be aboished.

There's so many ways we could make popular vote work. Basically the citizens don't really vote,it's all up to senate. It's everyone else's opinion not really socitey's. Which i think is very unfair. Popular vote can be a good thing. It can be made safer. We can use technology,a camera in the voting booths to monitor cheating, and the upcoming electors have to be watched to make sure there is no cheating or voting fraud. Even though there shouldn't be voting fraud,we can prevent it. I'd like to say the people of the nation should be able to vote for their own president,not someone else who is probably paid off by the electors. Cheating will go down if popular vote is used instead of electoral college,the elector can't pay everyone in the U.S  off. We need some type of change.

Electoral college has been around since our founding fathers,it's even in the 23rd amendment. It's like a tradition but some thimes you find better traditions. I'm not saying you have to change everything about elections, i'm just saying you could use some little tweaks. Electoral college is a process, along with everything else in life. Most U.S citizenz don't even vote, they think their opinion doesn't matter. I think the U.S government should embody the U.S and their citizens, not just senate or electoral college. Electoral college had a good run now it's time to change. We need to take action. If our vote is overruled by senate why vote? Electoral vote is anachronism.

4195C11B8348,"Dear , state sentor

I do not agree on how the election is happenening or how it is run. It is very unorganized and not very fair. I think if the votes are close then everybody should vote again not just one person outta ten people the state has to choose. Also it is not done professionaly like it is supposed to be. Some people deserve a shot at it but no you guys think that the presidents from the last election should be put back in well no because that same guy who won it last year has the chance to win it again and its not fair if he wins it again.

The first reason i disagree with the way the election is done is that it is not done fair. The first thing is that everybody should be able to vote the second time not just ten people from each state. If those five outta ten people choose the same then that state wont count and thats not fair at all. Some of the people outta the ten that were chosen either didn't vote the first time or they have no idea what they are doing what so ever and they could possibly mess up the system or they could mess up the votes.

My second reason is that it is not orgonizes at all. First they chose ten random people to vote in the second round of elecion. They won't give anybody else a chance to vote during the second election. MY second most important reason is that in the first election their are more than twenty people on the ballet and now the second election only has two people on the ballet i think theor hould be atleast three or four on the ballet. My last reason is on how they vote for the people of he second election. The way that they do it is not fair they send out a list with twenty names or more on it and they have to check at least two names and send it back and then they count the votes and then the fist ten for each state get to vote for that state do it is like a drawling and they even send it to the people when theor name is on the ballet.

My overall reason is that it is not done professionaly like it should be. The same people should be running for president again especially the one who won before because he has another shot at winning again. That means that they change to many things. Like the school food and drinks the food is now healthy and the drinks are diet some kids and teachers have to have sugar or they will not do so good through out the day like if the have diebetes they might need some sugar well they wont get it because all the food is healthy and the drinks are diet now.

A6B8F0EB90C3,"Dear, State senator I would like to have the chance to tell you my opinion on whether to keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president in the United States. I would like to argue the fact that I think the Electoral College should be kept for the way in which we pick our president and vice president. with that being said the Electoral college isnt any regular thing. It is a process in which we elect the two most important people who represent our country. The Electoral College was estalished in the constitution. The way the Electoral College works is that the president and chosen by a vote in congress and a popular vote of qualified citizens.

To commence, the Electoral College has been the way we choose our president and vice president for many years now. There hasnt been any problems with it. So why the need to change it? Many people beliee that the Electoral College is and old thing that its time to come up with something knew. As said in source 3 "" The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism"". Each state is given a number of electoral votes. The electors are the ones that eect the president not the people. Each candidate running for president in  somoenes state his their own group of electors. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is needed to elect the president. In my opinion the Electoral College works perfectly fine so their should be no reason to change the manner in which we elect our president and vice president.

Furthermore, if we were to change to election of pop[ular vote in the United States their will be more diversity and more political issues. Because with champaigning and that candidates electors will make it easier to win. And then it wont be really based on who really deserves to win. They could easily cheat in picking the candidate by popular votes. it shouldnt just be based on who has the popular votes their is more too it. We are talking about the person who will represent our country not someone who's about to gpo pick what dog they want for their family. Our country isn't a joke.

To Conclude, my response is that the Electoral College should be kept is the way we pick our president and vice president. There are many diverse opinions and this is a very critical topic but there is no need to change it now. Its all controlled and handled so well with the Electoral College a popular vote will just bring problems.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
85D0379B23AF,"People have their own opinions about the Electoral College; whether it should be taken away or kept. They have good reasons, but honestly do they really need the electors to vote for our people?

The Electoral College should be abolished. Why do people still defend the electoral college? The voters don't even vote for a president. They vote for a slate of electors. Why can't us voters control the electors. You're not really voting for the president, you're basically voting for electors who are pledged to the specific candidate. The electoral college isnt needed.

Let the voters vote for who they want. They know what that candidate is gonna do for their people when they become president. We don't need people who are pledged to that candidate to keep debating over them. It states that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

The Electoral College stays with us, only to keep the voting in balance. They should just do the winner-take-all. Everyone despises the electoral college. It has no purpose to be retained, but only to keep the voting balanced.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
2DA3EE593740,"In my opinion, the Electoral College is not an appropriate respresentation of the people's opinions. It is true that the popular vote determines the representative, but that does not mean that all citizen's views are expressed. Many citizens have stopped voting because of the ignorance that is the Electoral College. One should not vote for someone they do not know to represent their lives in the federal government.

The Electoral College might be the easiest way to contract a solid vote from American citizens, but laziness is definitely not efficient. If we want our country running smoothly and in a way that every citizen is comfortable with, everyone needs to be represented. Many citizens will start voting when they hear that they wont be pummelled with propaganda about politicians who think they know about what the people want. They will be elated to hear that they will actually be heard. They will actually make a difference in their country. The common people must be represented, not just advertisements. The conflict between upper and lower class will end because both will be able to make a difference in the minimum wages and tax increases.

Changing the election process to the popular vote would not only represent all people, but cut out the extremes. All politicians must say whether they are a Democrat or a Republican. With popular vote, we can go in depth to what the people really want. Like how gun restraints only go to an extent, so should the poeple's views. Most citizens aren't completely Republican or completely Democratic, and that's alright. There are the conditions in between that need to be addressed.

Coming from a centrally liberal family, I think that all elections through the Electoral College are hoaxes. The representatives of the College and even the president are picked a long time beforehand. The government wants to brainwash the citizens to slowly turn us onto their side. Even if the government rigs the votes but says that the result is completely dependant on the people, it will still belate citizens and get them to participate more in the voting process.

The Electoral College basically chooses for the people in some of the pass elections.

When the people in general vote for a candidate  they sometimes vote for a slate of numerous democratic or republican electors. We as the people not all the time but it happens, get puzzled when voting. When it comes to applying what you know about your future President some of the voting body doesnt know what candidate to decide on, since some times the candidates have similar campaign goals.

Some states called Swing States contain the people that pay really close attention to the candidates campaigns. The voters that pertain to these states want to really listen to what their prefered candidate has to offer, as well as the the opponents campaign. Now people really need to have an actual choice over who their countrys leader is, for some people they are fine with the Electoral College taking their vote and only think of it as a vote.

3681114059C1,"Dear State Senator,

I believe that the Electoral College should be kept and not changed. With the Electoral College, the presidential candidates can not have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College also reduces the risk of a run-off election, where no candidate wins a majority of the votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral college vote is also less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This system also encourages voters in toss-up states to be more thoughtful with their vote. The Electoral college also helps in balancing out the weight that large states with a large population lose.

With the Electoral College, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. This not only makes the votes more fair, but it also encourages the presidential candidate to be desirable to all regions, not just one that that the candidate knows will vote for him. A candidate with only regional apeal would likely cause residents of the other regions to feel that their votes do not count.

The Electoral College reduces the risk that no candidate wins a majority of the votes and instead, usually produces a clear winner. An example of this, as stated by Richard Posner in his arguement in defending the Electoral college, is when Nixon and Clinton were elected. Both had only 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winnning a majority in the Electoral College. The Electoral College also avoids creating pressure when no candidate wins a majority of the votes.

As said by Posner, voters in toss-up states who know they are going to decide the election are likely to pay close attention to the campaign and will be more thoughtful with their vote. They also will have received the most information and attention from the candidates. It also makes sense that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The weight in the political balance that large states with a large population lose is blanced by the Electoral College. An example ,given by Posner, is that the popular vote in Florida was very close in 2012, but Obama, who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes. The same margin in a smaller state would result in the winner getting alot less votes. This causes large states to get more sttention from candidates than a small state does.

In coclusion, I would like to say that keeping the Electoral College is a great choice. It will make presidential elections more fair and balanced than purely relying on a popular vote. The Electoral College produces more thoughtful votes, which inturn will result in the best candidate for the people to have as president.                       ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the house of representatives plus two for your senators. Each candiate running for president in your state has hin or her own group of electors. The Electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President  because when you vote for your candidate  you actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certifacte of Ascertainent"" lsiting all of the candidates  who ran for president in your state along  with the names of their respective electors.

Lets read a little more about it.

As most of you know, the presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday afer the first Monday in November. This is when there are two candidates running to be President of the United States. You would think it would just be you, the people, but theres actually other people that vote too, called the Electoral college. You help choose your states electors when you vote for your President, the reason why this happens is because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors.

Under the Electoral College system, voters vote for the state of electors and not for the president. The state of electors elect the president. The electors are bacically anyone not holding public office. The people who pick who it is, can be chosen from variaties of places. It could be the presidential candidates themselves, or it could be the states party central commitee, or it could be the state conventions. Each state only casts one vote. The Electoral College is unfair to voters becuase of the winner take all system, Candidates dont spend much time in states they have no chance of winning in. This pretty much proves that the Electoral College is very cruel and unfair.

The Electoral College has a very wide range. it spreads all through USA and each state has a different number of electoral Votes. Each party selects a bunch of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. no other region has enough Electoral votes to elect a President. The votes can be very close to the same number of both candidates, and thats a tough situation.

These electors are chosen from each state, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators.

The time to vote for electors is every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday. Some people disagree with this system, but the founding fathers of the U.S. had a reason for creating the Electoral College.

During a campain a candidate might have a lot of appeal in one area. For example a candidate might hae a lot appeal in the north where there is barely  any state that has more than eight electoral votes and confirm that the votes will go him. Those states with very low electoral vote count will not be enough to hit 270 total votes. This drives the candidate to spread his campain to other locations to get more votes, not only for that but because he has no reason to stay in those comfirmed states. So thismakes everyone across the nation feel that there votes do count.

It is true that it's not democrtic or that the electors are not well known.

I believe that the Electoral College should stay. I believe this because even though many people think of it as a horrible way to have presidential elections, it's probably more effective this way. When people first hear about the Electoral College, they automatically assume that they don't matter to the election, that everything is taken care of by the Electoral College, that if they didn't vote, nothing would change. Now if 1 or 2 people actually had this mentality, then it wouldn't matter, but it's not just 1 or 2 people, it's a pretty big amount of the American population.

The Electoral College seems as though our government wouldn't stand for this. As I stated before, the people feel as though their vote doesn't matter. This is not true. The Electoral College only work if people vote. They need the people's votes so that they know which groups are voting for which candidate. Now of course, this system is flawed. There will always be flaws in every system that humans do. We haven't yet to have made anything flawless, but the Electoral College has far less flaws than the vote by the general population.

I assume that the entire voting system, no matter how much we change it for better, will always be flawed and have the most flaws because we are choosing the leader of our nation. Someone somewhere will always do something wrong or figure out how to cheat the system in some way. The Electoral College is going to be the best way to handle this situation for a while. The people need to realize that their vote does matter (except in the case of Democrats in Texas, Republicans in California, etc.). People need to understand that the Electoral College is the best way to go.

This whole situation about believing whether or not the Electoral College should remain should be non-existent. People just don't understand that this is the best way to go so that the vote is as fair as possible and that the votes won't come in by the thousands. I hope that this letter makes you understand the people's thoughts on this situation. I also hope it gives you the motivation to create some sort of video or program that teaches people about the Electoral College with a lot of detail so that they understand why the Electoral College exists and why it isn't a direct vote from the people.

As you know the Electoral College is a process, not a place. But do you think many other people know that. They might get a hint if you can change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. In my opinion that would make me happier if the person I voted for came on tv everyday telling me new things. I wouldn't want someone I had no say in do that. because the person you voted for you obvioulsy had a reason to vote for them, in my persepctive of this, other people will catch on and find the good in the best one. The guy with the most votes wins.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, ""the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress"".

With that said, me being at the age of fourteen, I won't get the chance to go with the electors and vote for who I want, but being able to have the popular vote selected, I feel in a way as if im a huge part in the voting thats being held. Therefore having the Electoral College consist of 538 electors. I still woudl feel a part of the voting.

Each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own froup of electors. These elcetors are ususually chosen by the canidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilites are.

I feel as if popoular votes will benefit the region in many ways. But starting on the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, that he really insnt their president. If I wee presidnet i would want everyone to feel welcome and wanting to listen to what I have to say. Not saying that they would all like my decisons but I would want them invloved, I beileve every president should want their citizens involved and do be able to stay up to date. Statistics show that it has been argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. "" The founding fathers esatblished it in the Constitution aas a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"".

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Aboloshing the electoral college.  A toll taken in 2000 shortly after Al Gore, the popular vote had overcome the electoral vote. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose presidency. So if everyone make san effort to get involved and do their part, they can have the president they want. If they don't do their paert they shouldn't have a say in it. Thank you for your time.

This is telling us that the Electoral College that was established many years ago is the same thing that people are voting for now, because people today are fighting for voting by popular vote but the current Electoral College is the same thing. The current Electoral College is working fine, this is one of the reasons it shouldn't change but there are more reasons as to why it shouldn't change.

The current Electoral College has worked greatly to our nation even though people don't see it that way but it has. Another reason that the Electoral College should stay the same is because many people want to abolish the Electoral College even though its helped them choose a president that is either fighting for the nation itself or fighting for the people. The reason that people want o abolish the Electoral college is in an article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. In the article it states "" It's official: The electoral college is unfair... Abolsih the electoral college!"". This is telling us that some of the people in the nation want to abolish the Electoral College because they want their own system of electing a president.

The Electoral College has been named man things and has been tried to change but it can't because that is the only way people as a nation know how to choose a president. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it says "" ...The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.."". This shows us that even the people that are fighting agaist the Electoral College are making random statements that either go for it or against it because they don't know what they are fighting to achieve.

The Electoral College is the same thing people are trying to change because in the article ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register it states "" The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a president..."". This textual evidence shows that the Constitution was actually compromising what the people are fighting for and what is already used. This also tells us that the current Electoral College is what is needed and shouldn't be changed.

In Conclusion, the Electoral College shouldn't be abolished or changed to popular vote elects the president because the current system is working fine and the reason people are fighting agaisnt it is because they might not know what they are fighting to change or maybe they think that the Electoral College is changing the vote so that they government has their chosen president rather than the peoples president. All those ideas are things that people think when their favored senator, mayor, or President loses their chance. The people just need to realize that the current Electoral college was made by the fathers of this country in order to compromise what they are fighting for and what is already used. These are the reason why the Electoral College should not be changed.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

LOVE

how irrelevent, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency (Source 2). Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce (Source 2), and abolish the electoral college.

First, and most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters . Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" (Source 2).  If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3). Voters for the electoral college say that people in the swing states are going to pay closer attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters (Source 3),  but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?!

The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. If this is to occurr, then state delegates in the House of Represenatatives decide the President (Source 2). Each state only casts one vote, so the representative from Rhode Island would have just as much to say as the 55 representatives from the state of California (Source 1 and 2). Not only that, but a majority of people vote one party for president and another for Congress (Source 3). There are 538 possible votes in the electoral college (Source 1), so it isn't impossible for a tie to happen. In 1976, if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had switched candidates, there would have been a tie (Source 2).

And finally, the last thing that makes the electoral college as relevant as a new wheel for your horse and buggy is that, it's mind-bogglingly confusing. The electoral college is run by humans, so we must account for human error. The electors are just people chosen by the candidate who don't hold a seat in government (Sources 1 and 2). In 1960, a group of racists in Louisiana almost replaced Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, and he would have lost the election (Source 2). In Hawaii, also in 1960, two slates of electors were sent (Source 3). Faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for anyone else (Source 2).

In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.

They should always use the Electoral college because it wouldn't be fair if they went by the population of a state, just the simple fact that some states are more populated than other.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.

There has been many arguments about whether or not to keep the electoral college or to change the election process by popular vote. The best way to go would be to use popular vote. The Electoral College is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer, paragraph 14). There are so many reasons as to why you should change to popular vote, When you vote for your candidate, you're actually voting for your candidates electors, sometimes the state legislatures pick the electors, and also its an unfair process to voters. The Electoral College needs to be booted out!

When you go to vote, you think that you are directly voting for your candidates, that is no the case. You are actually voting for your candidates electors. You cannot control who your electors vote for either. They do not always vote for the same person you wnat them to. Voters may sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. This has happened. If the process were done by popular vote then their wouldnt be these problems taking place.

Who picks the electors? Sometimes it is the State Legislautures. They are responsible. In the article

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong""

, it states that in 1960, segregationists almos succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones that would then oppose John F. Kennedy. This was so a popular vote would not go to Kennedy. Also it was stated that ""faithless"" electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please. This doesnt seem fair to the people.

The whole process of the Electoral College is ""unfair to voters"". There is a reason behind this accusation. The winner-take-all system to be more precise. Candidates dont spend time in states that they know they have not a slight chance of winning, they tend to focus more on the ""swing"" states. During a campaign in 2000, seventeen states didnt get to see candidates at all. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. As it was stated in the article

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"",

""If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it..."".

The Electoral College is not the best way to decide who runs our military, or nation. We need a way to have a fair and equal vote. Popular vote is the way. Though the electoral college is a quick and easier way to get votes in, it isnt very efficient. The process isnt fair to the people at all, you're not directly voting for the candidate of your choice, and state legislatures, who have opinions, pick the elctors.

0EF91AC5D457,"Dear Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME from LOCATION_NAME. I wanted to adress the positivity in keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College has a small chance of winning with a Electoral College vote than a popular vote. Every state is important because everyone's a president. Also, there are swing states which is a winner-takes-all method.

The Electoral College has a small chance of winning with a Electoral College vote than a popular vote. Although in 2000 the Electoral College vote happened it is very unlikely to occur. Reason is that the Electoral College exceeds the share of the popular vote. Even a slight chance of a state plurality could cause a landslide electoral-vote-victory.

In the Electoral College no region has enough Electoral votes to elect a president. This means that a region needs to influence another to have atleast a elected president. For example, Romney was a solid regional(South) which means he focused in one region not the others, concluding his lost. So, it was very likely that Romney would not win because of his appeal to one region.

In the winner-takes-all method in the Electoral College induces the candidates. This was seen in 2012's election. The ost thoughtful voteers would have to decide the election, making Electoral College very fair.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
399134D6E1E8,"The Electoral College is a system where elected senators from each state vote for the next president of the United States Of America. But doesn't voting belong to the hands of the citizens? Citizens of the U.S should pick their president without the hand of the state senators that would vote for the other canidate. The state of Wyoming representing 500000 voters have as much say as the senators from California with 35 million people and more. The Electoral College is a flawed sytem in which the senators not the people choose their next president.

The Electoral College should have less say in the next presidency because of the ""Winner take all"" system in which candidates don't spend time in areas they know have no chance at getting their votes. These canidates would only then go for the Swing states and not even try to get the votes of the other states. Leaving the fate of the next president in the hand of a few is not a reasonable act. Although few citizens of America know the complex working of the government and need the knowledge of the senators to get the right vote. The goverment should know that giving the right to vote to only a few people is not a good solution to the problem. The problem lies where the senators not the people vote for their next prisent.

The prime example of a canidant that won the popular vote but loss on the Electoral vote was Al Gore. George W. Bush won the election with only 5 Electoral while Gore won the peoples votes. Only 5 people were able to change the presidental election, this is exacly why people should be the one to vote for their presidents not the other way around. This flawed system brings out the question that ""are we really voting for the president or our senators?"" it is the latter. The peoples votes aren't for the president but really is for the senators that then vote for the president. But the senators would then only vote for the president that would only for for the mijority of the people not the minority.

Electoral College should be replaced with a popular vote system that allows for more equal voting amoung the people instead of a few. The Electoral College should be instead a advice System giving people an idea of who to choose and tell the people what the president is looking for and what to do. With this new system presidents would actually go for the states that they knew wouldn't have voted for them before and at least try to get a few votes out of the smalle places that would vote for them. All in all the Electoral College has many flaws and holes, but in the end the people should the ones to vote their president not the senators.                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
769F4CA4E31F,"Dear Florida senator, this letter is to discuss my opinion about the voting system for how the new president of the United States of America should be elected or for how the current president should serve another term. The main topic for this letter, is wether or not we should keep the Electoral College or disregard it and go to popluar vote. Giving this topic into consideration, it should be best if we switch to popular vote. Candidates not focusing their attention on all the states and that the outcome could be a tie are the different apects on why we should abolish Electoral College and bring forth popular vote.

To begin with, candidates don't focus on trying to get all the states to vote on them in Electoral College. The explanation for this is because since its the ""winner-take-all"" system, the competors disregard the states where they know they're not going to win over the majority. They don't even show up to the states or try to win them over. ""During the 2000 campain, seventeen states didn't see the candidiates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campain ad"" quoted from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. Some might say that this is not a huge issue, but it is to the states that are being ignored. They want equality and a chance to be recognized by each of the rivals. It is clear to see that the candidates give no sign of importance to states that have slim chances of them voting for him/her.

Continuing on further, the Electoral College's outcome could end up in a tie. In a result of this mishap, the state delegates, from the House of Representatives, start to vote for the president. The vice-president is chosen by the The Senate. Each state has one vote to choose which side their rooting for. The silver lining in this decision is that, different states have different amount of population, so it's unfair for all the states to have the same amount of power in choosing the president. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" taken from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. People doubt that there will ever be a tie but they're were close ones in 1968 and 1976. There's no doubt that, if a tie happens in the Electoral College, everything would go down south.

To sum it all up, reasons why we should switch out of Electoral College is because candidates don't focus on every state and that the final outcome might end up to be a tie. The Electoral College should be abolished due to these reasons. Popular vote is the best for our country. It'll help the voting system by an abundant amount.

671D0569C835,"Dear Florida State Senator,

Every 4 years, many people vote for a president they think will lead the United States to greatness; some, however, don't know that they are voting for the Electoral College to vote on their choise. This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!

Because of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.

According to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.

Florida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the ""swing"" states to win ""the people's"" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the ""swing"" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!

In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery. Many people will thank you!    ",6,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
CC787397F33B,"Dear Senator,

I along with many other citizens have came to the conclusion that the Electoral College worth keeping. Though, the process itself has loose ends, overall it benefits the state and national election. The system uses general influence and a representative style of voting that makes the ballot more stable and dependable.

As a start, Electoral College electors are decided upon by the people. This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the poulation of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to emathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting.

In addition, some may argue that the Electoral College is risky and a representative may not always stay true to their word, but isn't this the case with all types of voting? A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election.

Lastly, though people may not want to believe it, the Electoral College brings a certainty to the ballot that popular vote could not do alone. Having a presidential tie could be the messiest turn-out of an election, but with representative voting we can tip the scale in either way, in the interest of any state or party. It's a game of chance, but sure enough works better than flipping a coin! The Electoral College makes the voting system more reliable.

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept as a part of the voting system because it gives a more concentrated form of voting, it only needs the same amount of trust betweencitizen and candidate as every other election style, and overall makes the voting system more reliable.                     ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D251CC495A0E,"Dear State Senate,

I feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don't care about voting for the next United States prsident because they don't get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.

In source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don't vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.

Source two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine,  the text says, ""... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters  would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Paragrapgh twenty-three, ""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don't even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won't do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn't care less.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be.

If the president was elected by the population not by the ""Government"" how would it change the way the U.S. worked today.

The text informs me that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors who in turn elect the president. In my opinion I think that there should be more than 3 votes or 4 votes for a state to elect a president. If the United States went to a population voting system the elections would be more fair to people that live in the smaller states. The text also informs me that in 2000 the U.S. presidential race, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush wont the election, receiving 271 electoral votes the Gore's 266. If the case of Gore losing the election a year later Bush went to war on Iraq.

If the United States went to a population voting system the percentage of votes would increase dramaticly to cause a honest election. If the election where to happen next election cycle I think that it would change the way the United States votes. People are fooled by the president when they say ""I will lower taxes, Protect the environment, or Stop the wars we are in"" I thnk that it's a trick for them to win the votes they need to win. If the population voted for the president i think that the United States would not be in debt.

The reason I think that the voting regulations is broken is that smaller states like Rhoad Island is a state that gets 3-10 votes and Claifonia gets 55 votes. If the only thing that make people happy is to be heard by the bigger people in life.

8FF4F02A7C76,"The Electoral College consists of more cons than pros. The systems that the unprogrammed engineers work on are complicated vast perspectives. When a president gets elected the most voters and does not recieve presidency, wouldn't that confuse you. Popular voting is an effective way to give a candidate presidency simply because the people want that candidate to be the one responsible for the United States. The Electoral College needs to change the way it picks its president. Otherwise, the U.S. would be vulnerable to a president that most people completely denied for the other candidate.

The thing with popular voting is that people can get the president they want. When the elections are based on which candidate has the most popular votes, there are no crazy tricks or a hidden trump card. All you have is a candidate that deserves to be the president of the United States. A good example is Al Gore and his presidency crisis. Most voters looked up to him as president. It was only until the quirks of the electoral college stole his opportunity of becoming president thanks to the system of the electoral college we have today. The situation that makes this crisis even worse is how the voters for the actual electors themselves cannot control whether they win the election or lose. This means that if we keep the routine of the electoral college we have now, there are many opportunities for an unwanted elector. Therefore, leading to an unwanted president.

Ever since 2000, many people have been suffering from economics and industry. This is the simple result of a bad electoral college system. The people of course should have most of the perks in picking a president. If the president is bad at his job in making the U.S. habitable, then the electors are to blame for making a huge mistake. Many doors are opened to sudden changes and confusing decisions. John F. Kennedy could've lost his position since all of the votes didn't necessarily go to him. There's a valid reason why people vote for a candidate. To pick the president they know suits them best.

I will admit to this though. Popular voting is not the accurate way to go through with. I mean there are situations where people just pick a president because he looks proffesional. Others are simply racist and go for the white candidate or even vise-versa. Popular voting is not perfect in the sense of the psychological opinions of the voters themselves. Besides, all of the people living in american soil are different minded. There is literally no way to immediately recognize who the voter is and why his reasons for voting are wrong. There is also nothing we can do since people are allowed to vote for whatever reasons they want.

Due to all of the information given to me about Al Gore and unwanted electors, it is the best solution to change the system to popular voting. Both sides of the arguments have strong reasons to either keep their system or change the way the electoral college is run. Meanwhile, lets be honest. There have been more political downfalls with the system we have now that can be fixed with popular voting. Even though there are people that vote for selfish and unreliable reasons, there is still a balance of the people who want this president and the people who don't. The U.S. is consisted of minds that think completely different in the sense of human nature. We don't live in a utopia where everyone agrees with eachother. Now, being able to let the U.S. decide who they want their president to be, it sounds like a pretty fair way to elect a new president, don't you think?                                            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
095B59682071,"Dear senator,

Retain the Electoral College. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electors is is required to slect the President. Each state has his/her own electors which are chosen by the candidate political party. You should keep the Electoral College because you have certainty of outcome, and the President is everyones not just yours.

The first reason why you should stay with the Electoral College is because you are certain that the outcome will be in favor of one of the candidates. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote may happen but it is very unlikely that it will even though that 538(number of electors in the Electoral College) is a even number(S.3).For example in 2012's election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the popular cast for him and Romney because all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state(S.3).  However,because of the winner-take-all system in each state,candidates dont spend time in staes they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the close,tight races in the ""swing""states(S.2). But, the winning candidates share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

The second reason you should keep the Electoral College is because the president is everyone's. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president by themselves. So for example,a solid regional favorite,such as Romney was in the South,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states he knows for sure that he will win(S.3).A president with only his regional apppeal is very unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions may feel like there votes dont count or that he really isnt there president.

In conclusion, you should stay with the Electoral College simply because you most likely not going to have a tie and because the president is everyone's.     ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
760E170518F5,"Dear state senator,

I as a citizen of florida, and of the United States of America, have the right to vote for the president of my country. I feel as though this right is taken away from me by the electoral college system. The electoral college is unfair and unjust to the people residing in the states. The electoral college may turn off potential voters because they may have the mind set that one vote does not matter because the president will be chosen by the electoral college anyways. The electoral college does not nessicarily speak for the people because the majority vote for a certain canidate will take all of the electoral college votes in one state. It is a possibility that the election is tied by electoral votes because the electoral college comes out to be an even numbe, therefor creating chaos in the political world.

When it comes to bigger states the majority completely overrules the minority even if the votes are 51% to 49%, so the majority canidate will take all of the electoral votes for that state. so this does not speak for all of the people, only the majority vote. Bigger states have more electoral college votes than smaller states, not giving the smaller states enough say in who becomes their next president. With popular vote, the size of the state you live in is not taken into account. All of the peoples votes are taken into account, not just the majority.

With the electoral college, you pretty much vote for the electors of your state, who then vote for the president. They pledge to a certain canidate according to their political party. How can you trust that they will always vote for who they say they are going to vote for? It is no gaurentee, they might just vote for whoever they please, even going against their own political party. In some rare cases the popular vote for one canidate has overruled the electoral vote for another, but the electoral winner has come out on top. Showing not what the people want, but what the electoral college has decided. How is this speaking for the people? How is this fair or practical?            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E3EC600A1754,"Dear Florida senator,

I strongly agree of keeping the Electoral College for the use of the congress' approval for the newly President of 2016. The Electoral College has a lengthy process, but can come in good use of determining the new President. Citizens vote for the electors and the electors decide who's best for the country. Even though, there are claims about the Electoral College not being fair for the people, I still defend it because it has it's good factors, like Run-off Elections,the requirement that a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal for the people, and the resoring weight of the eletoral number by population.

As so you know, the Electoral College is a process of the selction of the electors, then the gathering of electors to vote for the president and vice president. Finally, the electoral votes by the Congress. When the electors pick the president, they look at their background, such as, what school they attend, what they studied, where they were born, etc. They pick someone they trust to do the job. When there is a Run-off Election, the House Of Representatives picks the president. I personally think this is a good thing because they picked the person who would do best in the job by gathering everyone's vote to decide it. Because no country could have two presidents with two vice presidents. Some may say it's unjustice or not fair because the House Of Representatives decides the whole election. There is also the fact that when determining the winner, they both look at the popular votes and the electoral votes, and they see who got the most electoral votes and they win the election.

The Electoral College  puts it simple, because they choose someone with a region where they most likely get the most electoral votes. For example, Romney was in the South region, and he knows he wouldn't have to do much there because of that was where he was currently from. Now lets compare that to someone that was in the area around North Dakota. He would most likely not win that many votes since it's only three electoral numbers. So the Electoral College gives a chance for the president they chose to win because of where they used to be located in order to get the most popular and electoral votes.

The Electoral College restores and reduces some of the weight of the electoral by its population. Smalls states aren't widely noticed by the president because they feel like they should concentrated in the big states because of there electoral votes. Still, small states tend to make it easier for them because they look at if the state was either Republican or Democrac during the past years and they take note of that. They know they'll win in those states, even though they are small numbers, every inch of it counts to help them win the title of President.

Therefore, Mister Sentor, I agree in keeping the Electoral Vote because of it's reasonable factors that can help the president win. Popular vote doesn't tell anything because the people would know nothing about the president or what he accomplished. It should be kept because it has been used for many years now and has been useful for every president to win.

51FA8C2BDFE9,"The electoral college is how america chooses its president. The electoral college should not be how you think voting works but the complete opposite. It is a process that consist of electors who count the electoral votes. When a citizen votes their vote does not go directly as a vote for the president but it goes for the electoral college in your state. If that state has more votes for one candidate than the other then that state votes for that for that candidate as a whole. If the person I vote for doesn't get the vote for my state then that defeats the purpose of me voting. The electoral college takes away my say in choosing a president, the fairness, and it might have been put in the Constitution by the founding fathers but it is outdated.

The first reason why the electoral college shouldn't be used is because it takes away voters say in the decision for the president. If I vote for someone and the state doesnt pick him, that would mean my vote didn't count. That means i would now mean no one would even care about my vote. My vote wont even help make it a closer race. It's like my vote just vanishes into the air and is never seen again. If there are millions in the country and only 538 votes count. This is unrational to voters.

The second reason why the electoral college shouldnt be used is because it isnt fair. It is especially unfair because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidates don't even waste time going to states they know they cant win but only focus on swing states, which for one takes away the priviledge for the others that want to vote for the candidate to see them. It also takes away from the smaller states who don't get to put out as many votes as California with 55 or Florida with 29. Alot of states only have three votes and even though it could win or lose a races it still isn't fair to the people.

The electoral college was put into the Constitution by the founding fathers but they are not always right. The Constitution says all men are created equal but we still have had slavery. The Constitution has given us freedom of speech but once we step on school property that rule is taken away. The Constitution is not always the right way to go for everything. The founding fathers were very smart men but they have to think of how the country feels now because they were alive a long time ago.

In, conclusion the electoral college should just be put out of work because it is not the best way to elect a candidate, it takes away my say in the decision,the fairness, it was made by the great founding fathers but is outdated by how the counrty is now. Everyones vote should be out into play with the elections.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F2825D154E51,"The Electoral College should be abolished because citizens can't vote directly on which canidate they want. The electoral college is unfair because a candiate that wins the vote of the people, they can't become president if they don't have enough electoral votes. For example when Al Gore was elected, Gore won the popular vote but could not become president because of insufficent electoral college votes.

It is not fair to the people that their vote cannot count unless it goes through the Electoral College. The Electoral College bases on what the overall state vote is, instead of the individual voter, thus making it unfair to each voter if they do not get an equal say in who they want as president. Said in source two, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The citizens should be able to choose who governs their country. Direct elections are much easier than having an Electoral College. The voters vote, the majority wins and we have a new president.

In the Electoral College system, the voters vote of another set of voters who vote for the candiate of their party. The Electoral College way is much more difficult than having a popular vote method of voting.

In some cases,when no candiate wins a majority of the popular vote, in source 3, ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral college(301 and 370 Electoral votes, respectively).""  This could be a clearer solution to havings run-off elections. Also in source 3, ""There is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the voters cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidentail election process, is reduced by the Electoral Collage, which invariably produces a clear winner."" The president should be choosen by what the people want. There are also some citizens who may be a republican in a democratic state and vice versa who's vote wouldn't even be considered because the Electoral College will be voting for the overall states vote. In a popular vote everyone gets a say in who our president will be.

Having the popular vote method is a way to give all citizens a voice in who they want their next president to be. It's also a way to get people involved with government. If everyone gets an equal say,Then the president is choosen fairly among the citizens instead of a group of electors that go by the states overall vote rather than everyone getting equality. After all, America is a democracy and the electoral college isn't very democratic.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I beleive that we should keep the electoral college. I say that because it would be choas if we did not have them keeping the voting in check.

I can see where you think that the electoral college doesnt really do anything. But thats were you would be wrong. I say that because without them there could be a horrible president that just made ppresident because he was good at advertising and he is paying off companys to advertise to make him look better. But i can see what your getting at because he did win fair and square but that doesnt mean that he will turn out to be a good president. That were the electoral college will come in, by chosing the true person who will be there for our country when we need him the most. And its not like the people are not choosing their president. The electoral college still go's with the peoples vote they just go in more depth with choosing the right president. So in the end everyone wins. the people will have the best leader of the united states they can have thanks to the electoral college. So why take them away, all they do is help us.

I think it would be better if the canidates would vist every state and talk to them about what changes would be made if theyre the president.

The state legislatures are more responsible than us as voters so probably our vote doesnt really matter. Also the elctoral college truly dont pay attention to the problems about the votes and states that dont have a spark of hope that arent effected by the election but in elections it gives the chance as voters to express that political knowledge and background who would be best as our president.

Other than that the other side of the argument is reasonable too.

9D1233DCF8E0,"Senator,

I have many reasons to respectfully agree and disagree for the placement of your Electoral College. In many ways I know you have your reasoning for why you belive our country needs our Electoral voters, but it some cases others such as me don't belive that we do. I fully respect your decisions as Senator, but I would like to shed some light upon the situation, from the people's views.

For about 3 years now, I have been researching how the Electoral College works. Upon discovering many news and magazine articles, I noticed that many people are not in favor of the final, decided stage of election. In my eyes I see that I am not getting my full rights and potential as a voter and a legal citizen as I should be granted. Instead, I am voting for other people to vote for me, and I think that is unfair to myself, and my fellow U.S. citizens. I do not believe that all Americans are educated in the field of knowing that they are not getting the majority vote, and that the Electoral College is.

Aside from my doubts in the way this situation works, i discovered and realized that the Electoral College is a more organized and aforable way of deciding things. In the winner-takes-all stand point as most people call it, some voters take advantage of the voting system and choose someone running for President based upon look, appeal, or ethnicity. In situations such as this, I do believe it is important for an Electoral College to step in, for the pure fact of too many random and unthought choices.

My overall decision Senator, would be that the popular vote of the people would be more respectful as a group, than as a seperate election diferentiating between the people, and the Electoral College. With our votes we are deciding who we want to run our country, and who we want to make decisions that are best for us. With other people deciding our views on how to run our government, we are not getting what we want or need. Senator, I leave you with this, is it about the people's rights, or the people's thoughts on the unknown?                                                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
DC5C9B011657,"We should keep the Electoral College for a number of reasons. While it is usually thought of as ""out of place"", it is the fairest method in voting for our President. The Electoral College, first of all, the outcome of the Electoral vote is less likely to cause a dispute than the popular vote. Second, avoids the problem of Run-Off Elections. Last, the Electoral College helps balence the political weight for large states (by population). We need the Electoral College so not create any problems.

The outcome of the Electoral College vote is less likely to cause a dispute than the popular vote. The number of elctoral votes a candidate gets usually exceeds his popular vote. For example, ""Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent on the popular votes cast for him and Romney.""  Since most of the states have a ""winner-take-all"" system, its easier to determine which candidate gets the elctoral vote if there is a plurality in the state. A tie in the electoral vote is possible, but not very likely, even if the total is an even number. Voting based on the popular vote would just cause more problems than we would like to deal with.

Run-Off Elections are avoided because of the Electoral College. Run-Off elections are elections that are caused when neither candidate recieves a majority of the votes given. As the article states, ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 Electoral Votes)"".

B49ED6AC9AF3,"Voting time is here again and its time to cast your vote for the president, but do you know what really happenes when you vote? See the United States Constitution has this process set that the election of a president consists of the selection of electors and each state has electors based on population. Citizens vote for the electors canidate and the elecotrs take the majorety of the votes wheither it be Demicratic or Republican and all votes of that states electoral representatives vote for the states winning president. Crazy right? But is that the most effective way to this and if it is not the why shouldnt we chage it to something more fare and equal and not leave it up to some special elecorss. Leave it to the people to decide who we want for our president.

The United Staes is a fairly new country compared to others around our world yet we have some pretty advanced technologies and some really brilent ideas but when our founding fathers made the Constitution I dont think they made the best choice. Even some of our previous presidents like Nixon, Carter, Dole, Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO have said we need a better way to elect our presidents. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote and was set on presidence but did not win thanks to this outragious system and lost the electoral vote and lost his shot at precendence. If you win the popular vote doesnt that mean your the fan favorate and the citezens want you to be president because the majority voted for you. During a pole shortly after Gore lost people were asked if we should keep the system we have now or chang and 60% of the people asked said that we should change. Cant you see the people are cying our for help and asking to change the system so someone like Gore doesnt get cheater again.

When campaining as a president shouldnt you try to visit every state to try and increase yo popularity? Well sadly it really doesnt work like that with this current system you see some presidents lets take Obama and Romney as and example. Some staes wont see the canidates at all because they ""know"" they will win the electoral votes. Obama in the 2012 election never visited some staes like Ohio or Romney and flordia because they knew that the majorety would vote for him and he would win that state. Now how is that fair. If it was up to just a popularity vote each president campaining would go to every stae trying to get as many voters as possible instead they say eh i will skip that state because I will get the majorety any ways. On top of the the electoral system makes smaller states less important because it is set up where more population means more votes. That to me is saying well you a small state so everyone in that stae you mean way less that this other state. California, Texas, and Flordia are the most campianed staes in the US because they have 55,38,29 votes respectivley. now places like Arizona, Ohio, north and south Dakota have six, three, three, and three respectivley. how is any of these people less important adn less aluable the the ones in California, Texas or Flordia.

I still cant find a reason why we should keep this sytem around and the more I think about it the more I want to get rid of it. The electoral college is taking our power as US citezens our of our hands and defies us from voting for the president and in turn makes us vote for special offece people.

They vote on the things that interest them, not the country. When you vote for anything, your main pryority is ""Does this make the country a better place and will bring more benefits to the people in this country or state""?

The Electoral College voting system is much easier to count who won because its a ""winner-take-all"" system. This can be seen when "" The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral vote""(Source #3). This example shows even tho the popular was very close, Obama still won Florida and got those 29 electoral votes. There is a another way people view the Electoral College and they say that the ""Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational""(Source #2). They also say the best argument against the Electoral College is the disaster factor.

Each person has their own point of view about each thing but mine is that we should stay with the Electoral College system because it benefits the people in Florida and the United States.

For example, ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. . . . Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state""(Source #3). This shows a certainty of the outcome for that state. This also cause candidates to not spend their time in states ""they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states""(Source #2).

The electoral college is good because if the state is small it has a large population. It can have more electoral votes than big state. it helps avoid run off elections. there is also the swing state with a winner take all.

So the biger th state dose not mean more electoral votes. It actily has to do population. the bigger the population the more electoral votes. So for example florida has 29 electoral college votes and montana has 3 electoral college votes.

It helps avoid run off election when nixon and clinton ran they each got 43 votes. So the popular vots helped the end resolt. It can make it to where a single vote candicide the election. To produces a clear winner.

The swing state method is when they candidates campaign in the toss up states. where the voters are more likkly to pay close attention to the campaign. The swing states can diside a election.

So in conclution electoral colage workes. because big states cant get the most votes. avoid run off elections. swing states are the states who pay most attion tho the campain. That is why the electoral college still workes.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
8F47C4F378EA,"I am a high school student and in my point of view what i infer about reading the passage is that election by popular votes needs to happen. why am I thinking like this? There are several reasons, well first i dont know what this people are doing maybe they are being paid to choose the president it dosen't mean enything that they got more ethoes than the rest of the state. People should choose who they really want to be the president, they should give prove of when they count the votes.

The countrie is the home of alot of people imigrants and native we all should have the same rigths and that rigth is to vote for the person that will lead the countrie to a better place, not some slate of the state. Maybe they got more ethoes than the rest of the countrie but each person is smart to know what is good and what is wrong. In the passage they tell the reader, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Then what is the point of voting maybe this people are not even considering the people who vote they are only doing what they think is rigth.

This people have alot of money but they still want more and more, inportant people would brive this elector with alot of money, and they would be doing whatever they are ask for. They could be 200 votes of the entire state that if the state only as 20 electors thoes are the votes that are counting in real life. What future could we have trusting this electors our chances are really low we cant let this happen .

After reading all my letter you will understeand why did I talke like this about the elector and why  the electoral college have to be remove. The word of the entire countrie should coun't more than the wor of 200 people. Thoes 200 could be in who knows what to trust our future. this is why I think that electoral college is not an opssion.                            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
B39FCEF07F51,"The things that go on in florida about keeping in electorial college is working for us there are good reasons and bad reason where to keep it or change it to popular vote.

I think keeping the electorial college is better for everybody we vote on the represenitive by there good ideas not there popularity. in the electoral college it consist of 538 votes and the majority of 270 votes is usally the winner and he is voted for because of his good ideas not if he is populer with the people or represenitives. in and electorial college where the electors vote in the president and the vice president which helps out the decison for the better man or woman in the white house, so the people should keep the elector college and not change to the populer vote.

the united states should keep they electoral collge because the people vote and it is won by majority rule and should not be changed. the people vote for who they think is right for the job not just random people vote its unanimus decison to who wins. There is no reason to change the way things are going it has always been the same way the whole time ever since the united states was made in the first place. the people elect that is the advantage of a democracy which we have and in a democracy we vote by majority and thats how it most likley will stay in the united states no matter who the goverment is trying to vote in who they want but the united states is the power to vote in who goes into the office not the goverment so there is no chane of rigging all the votes so the unites states should not change to a popularity vote. power to the people is an old metaphor that indicates that we have the power to vote unlike in other countries where one man rules and the people have no power to vote for the best man to take over so in an electoral college we have all mighty power to make our own decisons to our future.

so the united states will stay in electoral college forever but anything could happen to stop it.         ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E243F4B2D0FA,"Dear Senator,

According to the articles and arguements given I think the most effective way to get a premeire president for our nation is vote on the behalf of the Electoral College. In my view of the Electoral College has more experience aswell as having a sense of quality and values that they know can change the country.If we depend on the popular vote of the country,only in the favor of the people classes and opinions of the people, it may lead to presidents that cant maintain order of his or her country.Nonethless,the votes of both Electoral College and majority vote is basically as lucky as a flip of a coin,one side may lead to ultimate failure and the depression of a country the other may lead to momentous uprising of the country,in chosing the right leader of the country.Although, based on the criteria I just created is really puzzling your mind about what president is best I believe that the Electoral College may clear things up and make the best decision in favor of the people.

Based on the articles,the Electoral College does knows best because although they lack of democratic pedigree doesnt mean there wont be democrats in the whitehouse, because they have requirements of how to find the best fit no matter what party included.Even if they were unsupportive of the democrats Romney lossed as example of equality of parties on the College's choice.The articles also state that no popular votes determine the election of a president showing that although more than half of the population in the nation picks a candidate it wont matter unless that candidate gets a majority vot of the Electoral College aswell.Stating that the expierience of the College will prevail on the birth of a new president,no matter what party,no matter the odds of a popularity vote, the Electoral College is a perfect example of this nation's motto because they are truely a sign of equality between candidates that might become great presidents of our nation.

2D557A2D84E9,"""ugh"" ""so tired of the same old voting preocess"" ""who even cares, not like we get to pick the president. Thats the sound of all the people who voted for someone to be President. As a voter id like to say that we shouldnt keep the electoral college for voting for President. Theres such good arguments on weather or not to keep it.

For my first reason im going to tell you how its just a unfair way of voting and its harsh. With the winner takes all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chanve of winning. Focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. As said in source 2. When you vote with the electoral college you, the people arnt really voting for the president. Its the electors who aucutally vote for president and theres no point in you voting if they continue with the electoral college.

My second reason is that the electoral college is known as the diaster fator. To me thats not something i would want to persue in using while voting for my president. Consider that state legislatures are the ones responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could defy the will of the people as supported text from source number 2 as well. Given that many voters vote on one party the election can be expected to reflect the will of the people. The electoral college is just unfair to the people. They just pick someone without much reality put into it and there should be more thought to it or a wider range of votes.

Last but not least the electoral college is just outdated and irrational. It is widely reguarded as an anachronism, which means that its something that seems to belong in the past. And thats the past, were in the present. We have moved on from that and we need something new. It should just be overruled and like i said before something new. You want something that auctually takes your vote into consideration and not just letting some elector pick the president.

Yes the person with the most votes should win, but it really depends if they have the skills and criteria to run the country and be sucessful as the president. So as a voter, id like to say no more electoral college and something new!                                             ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
87F529DB9D27,"Yes, the Electoral College Works because in source one it tells the reader the steps you have to take in order to be able to work. For example in paragraph five it states how each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. It also states that the electors generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but some state laws vary on how electors are selected and for what there responsibilities are.

It is a hard process to go through in order to be a candidate and get voted to be president because people have the right to choose who they want and why they want the person to be president. Some reasons why people want the person to be president are because of the things there going to do like make the country better or improve the government while they are in charge for four years. Reasons why they might not want to choose the person as a president could be because of many reasons. Source two states how some voters do not vote for the president but vote for the slate of the electors who in turn have to elect the president.

Source three mainly talks about the five reasons to keep our methods of choosing the president. A good example is how in the catogory certainty of outcome it states that president Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the elctoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes casted for him and Mitt Romney. Most voters that end up in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign as it states in paragraph twenty. But, big states lose virtue by population. For example Obama who won the vote only got twenty nine electoral votes out of the state of Florida. In Wyoming he only got three electoral votes so this means that larger states get payed more attention than the smaller states do.

In conclusion the Electoral College does work but, it all depends the how many people vote in each state and how many the electors decide to vote.                            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

You may think that we dont need the electoral college but we do need the college because we also vote there and if  we dont then we do other important stuff there.

so instead of making a extreme dicision like this then you should think about the people and not let a hasty decision have a disaster on this good state because we could have horable president or govenor so please think about what you do or it will end nicly or horrably desatrouse.

so inconclusion changing the college to a popular vote could be a bad thing to do and hope you make a good decision that will mend the wrong and premote the right and have a nice day and make a good decision.    ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
13C78F5B1679,"Dear Senator Im writing you this letter to let you know that I argue with you of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight  races in the ""swing"" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

3D0919A418E6,"Mr. Senator , I agree you should keep the Electoral College because it a has a major impact who gets elected .

The Electoral College consists of 538 electors . A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the president , and that helps the election move more swiffer which helps the people give more time to think , adjust , and prepare because most states have ""winner-takes-all"" they can have for time , unless they just rush it also that includes republicans and democrats . For example In 2012's election Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of popular votes cast for him and Romney because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in the state . Also they say that the citizens are voting not for the president , but for the slate of elector , who is turn elect the president . Eventhough though that is true and they do vote for a slate most of the time each party selects a slate of electors trust to vote for the parties nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed . I think they are doing a good job cause there has been no complaning , also statistics  , maps , and facts shows who recieved the most popular votes . So you cant say they're cheating or treating people or doing it unfairly . Additionally people are glad well most people are glad who they picked because they're on their side , and plus majority rules and they will just have to pay the price if they mess up .

B81A83BDADA7,"Since our very first President George Washington our founding fathers have created a system of how a President shall be elected. For many years this system has been proven to be effective. This system or process of electing our Country's President is known as the Electoral College. The Electoral College was used to elect our very first President George Washington and our current day President Obama. This process is full proof and has yet to let our Country down.

The Electoral College is a process created by the founding fathers to make the choice that the people want. After all this is the peoples Country. According to the Source ""What is the Electoral College?"", written by the office of the Federal Register,The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors. There are a total of 538 members in the Electoral College. If a candidate has more than 270 votes then they will be our new President. The number of how many members depends on the number of members in its Congressional delegation. There is a total of one each for every member in the House of Representatives and two each for every member in the Senators. When a person votes for his or her Candidate they are actually also voting for thier candidates electors. After the election everything is certified and sent to the National Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election, also stated in ""What Is the Electoral College"", by the Office of the federal Register.

More than 60 percent of voters would like to abolish the Electoral College and just have a direct election. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency, states ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plumer. Not alone have 60% of our voters agree upon giving the Electoral College a boot but so has Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Voters don't feel close enough to the process by which who leads are Country. When voters vote they feel as if they are voting for Electoral members and not the Candidate himself. Voters can not control  whom the electors vote for, after all electors can always defy the popular vote and choose a candidate of their liking. More then half of our voters think that the Electoral College is unfair, out of date, and unpredictable. If the people voted for the President directly then states with a larger population would always win. That would be an outrage, states like Texas would get a better chance then states like Florida. The Electoral College is a full proof plan that avoids run on elections by insuring that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Although others want to abolish the Electoral College, there is no better system for choosing our President.

The Electoral College requires a presidentail candidate to have trans-regional appeal, says ""In Defense of th Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, by Richard A.

Our founding father have created an effective method that has avoid many problems that may have occured if this process was created.

We technically don't directly vote for the president, we vote for some person who then chooses the president. Since this contry is democratic it think that the popular vote is definitly the way to elect the future presidents.

To start off,the electoral college isnt fair to voters because candidates only go to states where they know they will get the vote. In the article ""The indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the systemare wrong"" it says ""The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance at winning"". People vote for the person who they want to be in office not for someone who might vote for the person who you want. I guess you could say voters in swing states are going to know more about the election. But you never know that does not always happen.

Secondly the eclectors could be anyone and could be chosen by anybody,there are no kind of qualifications. On the other hand the regular voters actuaully have to meet some sort of standards like you aren't allowed to vote if you have commited some sort of crime a certain amount times. And most of the time the American people dont see adds or commercials about the electorates. Howdo we know we can trust these random people with our vote? In my eyes and probably most peoples eyes, see this system as a non-democratic way to vote for our president.

With the electoral college, people don't get to have the freedom to vote for who they want to be elected. Instead they vote for a slate of electors who in turn, elect the president for you. There are a few problems with this. One, the electors could end up not doing their job. They might refuse to vote for their party's candidate and end up voting for whomever they please. That could turn into a riot or just leave a lot of people very unhappy. The electors could also mess up their vote and end up voting for the wrong candidate. Say they are loyal to the president they are suppose to vote for, but then end up choking and voting for the opposing president. Further more, what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. (""What's wrong with the electoral college"") Another thing is a tie could happen. A tie in the electoral vote means that the election then gets handed to the House of Reprsentatives, where they will then vote on the president of their choice. Either way the people do not get a say on who they want for president. It is all in the hands of people that can turn their backs on who they promise they will vote for, and end up voting for the opposing president. If the people got to choose who they wanted to be president, then we wouldn't run into any of these problems. There would never be any ties or broken promises.

0202B3446E2E,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I would like to make a request. Please abandon the idea of the electoral collage. thats a childs game. It is not fair game. The electoral collage sends a certain number of electors to represent a state. Why not let an individual person represent his or her self? it is obsurd that in Wyoming, a state of 500,000 voters, only get 55 represenntitives. It is with great agrivation that i ask you to make this change.

Furthermore, I would like to state that the electoral collage is outdated and irrational. There is no need for this great mess. The oposition states that the electoral collage is a nessesity for organization. I personally beg to differ. I feel that voting for presidents would be more organized if we counted each individual vote from each individual person. I no longer want to vote for a slate of representitives when it comes time to vote for another president.

In addition, did you know that there were four presidents that had the mentality to abolish the electoral collage? These presidents, as stated in The Indefensible electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradford Plumer, were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. As well as the U.S. chamber of commerce and the AFL-CIO. they were all in favor of abolishing this horrid electoral collage! AL Gore lost the presidency because of the electoral collage. He had 60% popularity vote.

Furthermore, I am ashamed to say that each state has its own amount of representitives. We should have a universal number of representitives for each state because it is unfair that a president can lose a presidential election because a state that had an increaced amount of representitives ran against them. I ask you to please vote against the electoral collage for the following three reasons:

The representitives dont amount to the number of individuals that voted.

The electoral collage is outdated and irrational

Each state has an individual amount of representitives.

In conclution, I ask you to please hear the peoples pleas and abolish this garbage we call the electoral collage. I thank you for taking the time to read this letter and hear what the people have to say about this matter.

6BBD726B840E,"Im agree with the Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. This is my claim, A dipute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happened in 2000, but it's likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example, President Obama recive 61.7 percent of the electoral votes copared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and for Romney. Because the total number of votes 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates,  to focus on their campaign; the voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates.  The electoral college restores some of the weigth on the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The most popular vote was in Florida in 2012. Who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes. So other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates ina campaign tahn a small state. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the  Electoral College the 301 and 370 electoral votes, repectively.

There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which of would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. Democrats in Texas, and Reublicans in California. Thir vote no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the compaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course  no voter's vote swings a national election, about one-half the elegible American population did vote in 2012's election.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
7CE8F3872E67,"I think that they should not change the Electoral College because it tells us what kind of president we will have in the future and what kind of changes he will make. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. You see this is something that happened a long time ago the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This is a system that makes sure that we know what kind of president we are putting in the white house and what are things to make this state a better state to live in and to have a good job. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Ascertainments are then sent to the Congress and then to the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

In the article of The Indefensible Electoral College its trying to ask you why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong and it tells you why. What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? They were trying to abolishing the electoral college and they were not alone, according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won thwe popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is the thing that can not be changed because this is a system that we can pull up see what they were elected for and why they were voted president and how many times. It helps us how we can choose the right president or the right vice president. In 1960 in Hawaii, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was president over the senate, validated only his opponents electors, but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. This happened a long time before i was born. You see only one state can casts only one vote in Wyoming,representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California,who represent 35 million voters. In 1968,a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election;in 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters on Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.

In a article i read it says that there are five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. There are called Certainty of Outcome,Everyones President,Swing States,Big States, and the final one is Avoid Run-Off Elections. Each one tells us how choosing the president and shows us a map how it works and we can see which state shows a breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state. This is something that can help us understand how to vote and how long they will be the president or the vice president i think that we should not change the Electoral College because how would it work without it and how would we pick the next president. This is a hard thing because it would take time to discusses it with the senators and it would take a lot of votes to agree or disagree to the idea. This is why i think that they should not change this because its been around longer before i was born.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5009FFC4BA6C,"Dear senator, if I may speak for the people I think that the Electoral College was a great idea thanks to the founding fathers. The concept of every state in the United States of America and the people in the states have the power and decison over chosing the commander and chief. The fact that the founding father created the Constitution and the amendments is right because look at where we are today in history. The US is so strong and civilized because of the Constitution it keeps us heading in the right direction. Back to the keeping the Electoral College and its voting system.

The right to vote is a great power and acknowledgement. The people go to vote and then the state counts the the votes and which ever candidate gets the most votes recieves the electoral votes which is separated between the states. This is a grat thing because every right full human being has a chance to make a difference. If the winning candidate was only chosen for popular votes then it would be uneven and unfair then mobody would want to vote. Dont you think mr or miss senator that if the founding fathers thaught about this many years ago and they saw us today they wouldsay what a great idea and concept we came up with. The founding fathers thaught about the right of the people and thats what counts.

The Electoral College is a smart way to give the people there right to vote and chose who will make things better. THe candidate has to appeal to the people as the right guy to run the United States and can help improve the economy. The electoral college is not to make things harder it is to make things right and even for everyone. SOme states have little populations so they get less electoral votes compared to others states with huge populations they get more electoral votes cause they have more people voting which is fair for everyone. In the end the Electoral Collge is a efficient and non problematic solution to voting for a president or candidate.

The other fact is that the Electoral College provides a certain winner. The candidates have to go out and speak with the people and explain what they want to change and improve in the United states. The candidate have to prove they are worthy and capable of creating a better tomorrow. For example Barack Obama has created millions of more jobs for people and has brought up our economy. Since the crash in the economy he has done an amazing job in creating a better tomorrow for the people. How did Obama win well its the cause of the popular vote of the state and then which every person votes and then the winner get the elctoral votes of the state that is 538 divide between the states. The people did there job in listening and watching the candidates and how they can make us stronger. Mr or miss senator I would like you to think how would you feel if the you where a founding father and what would you want the us to be like in the future and how you can achive that and the peoples right.

The facts are all here the founding fathers and how they came up with this idea and the diddnt even know what wuld be the out come but in the end the right to vote and how every single human being makes a difference in chosing the president of the United States and commander and chief makes every person valuable to tomorrows out come. My honest opinion mr or miss senator is that we should keep the Electoral collge cause it is based on peoples right which is most importan and that why the constitution is based on the peoples right.

8409E31023B3,"People have choices and they can be right or wrong. What if your choices didn't count and somebody else chose for you. That'll make you furious since you took your precious time trying to make the right choice and somebody else chooses for you and it's not what you wanted. I think there shouldn't be an electoral college since people want the president they chose, not the electoral college. There should be an immediate change to this faulty system of electing a president.

The voices are spoken by the people and it should count. Everybody's opinion counts and is a better and more preferable way of electing a president. The people are furious of this voting method and some aren't. They're wrong if they're agreeing on the electoral college method. When people cast a vote on who they want to be as president, it goes to the electoral college instead and then they choose who gets to be the president which makes it unfair for the people who took their time off to vote.

Almost the entire country takes their time off to vote on president who can take care of this country and make it even better. Aside from that, whenever someone votes, thinking that it's actually going for the president, it goes to a slate of electors who elects the president. Sounds fair to us doesen't it? Nope, this is truly unfair to the people and their opinions are valuable and should be treated fairly by actually counting that vote towards the president, not for the slate of electors to choose for us.

Famous president and also known as the best president in the country due to his efforts of freeing slaves in the north, Abraham Lincoln is a very honorable person. He has a famous quote that goes well with the electing issue we have today. He believes, and we all should too, that this is ""

of the people, by the people, for the people.

"" One of the most favorable quotes said by Abraham Lincoln and is one hundred percent, completley true. Whatever we think is right, like the people electing the president, it should be for the people.

So in conclusion, the electoral college should just go away and let the people choos e . It is simple and will make everyone feel good that they actually choose who gets to be president, not the electoral college. It will be fair to all of us and will make everything better than it is now.

""

Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election ."" This quote is wrong in many ways due to the fact the everyone want's that president because they prefer what the president will do in the future, not because of some political preference. A persons choice is as valuable as a politcal preference but either way an elctoral college is no way to choose a president. Everyone's vote counts and they will decide who gets to be president because of what they prefer about the president. So therefore the electoral college is a wrong step to our country and should be changed permanently and let us, the people, choose who gets to be in charge of our country.

FE1203E26CAC,"Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College is ruining everything that our fore fathers have worked for! When Americans vote, the majority believe that they are voting for the President of their choice, instead they are voting for a group of people, who will hopefully vote for the candidate they had wanted. The Electoral College is wrong for many reasons, but I'll narrow it down to two for you; People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote.

First, The Electoral College is wrong because voters are voting for electors not the President. When voting there are two groups of people voting for the President; the People and members of the Electoral College. Members of the Electoral College are actually choosen by state legislatures, meaning that their can be a point in time where the statre legislature chooses to pick a certain group of people based off of their political party. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the electors from the Democratic party; meaning that even if most people voted for Kennedy (the president at the time) he would still not be elected because electors would not vote for someone who was not apart of their party. It's happen before, so who's to say that it won't happen again.

Second, electors may or may not choose the President based off Popular vote. Even though if we did base the presidental election off of Poplular vote people might vote based off of region, meaning that most people in the south would vote for someone like Romney, but we have to consider that not everyone in the south would vote for one person. Also it is also true that it electors rarely vote against the Popular vote, but it is possible that the majority of the 538 electors will vote against the people.

In conclusion, The Electoral College should be terminated because People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the Electoral group, meaning that the Popular vote would'nt even matter against the Electoral College. Also the Electoral College may acknowledge the Popular vote, but still vote for a different candidate. If you do choose to help me terminate the Electoral College, I say we try to get help from the guy who actually played the ""Terminator"" I heard that he is part of the government system in California now so he could probably help us.

26C28DEA2690,"The electoral college is a process where electors are sent to choose who the next president will be. Electors usually vote for who they said they were going to but can change this vote. I think we shouldn't have the electoral college anymore because, The people don't get to actually choose who they want to elect and voters can change who they're going to vote for.

The people who are voting for their president they wanted elected arn't actually voting for him. In source two, it says, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" This means that even if the president gets the popular vote, it doesn't mean he will always win. Electors can and will avoid the states that they know are not going to vote for the person they want to win the elections, and will avoid those states. In source two, it says ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canididates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" Sometimes the voters don't even get to see the electors they're voting for and some states don't get them at all. The electors also purposley avoid certain states because they know that they won't vote for them or give them a chance to swing the election.

Voters can also change who they're voting for on the spot and no one can say or do anything about. In source two, it says ""In the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" People voting for who the wanted to win the election could be accidently voting for someone else because of the electors work. The elector shouldn't be allowed to change his vote, because that is cheating people out of who they think should win and making it seem like their vote didn't even matter. Some states also have more electors than others, making it so that the person one state votes for will get more votes than the other states.

Some people think that electoral college system should still be there. Source 3 says, ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)."" Even if the electors that are selected and its said that the trust is rarely betrayed, the electors can still betray the person they're voting for and it can happen and it has happened before. It also doesn't say anything about the electors avoiding states that they know won't vote for them and going to states that can swing the election.

In conclusion, people don't get to vote for who they want to and electors can do basically whatever they have to do to win. People vote for the president they want to win and can be cheated out of that by the electors. The electors are allowed to move from a state they think won't vote for them to one they think will. The electors can also change who they're voting for during the elections. The electoral college is a system that cheats voters out of who they want to vote for and seems like a outdated and non-democratic method.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

148CA62EF887,"Dear, to Miami senator. Americans should change election by popular vote for the president of the United State. The Electoral College it's not a good thing that is helping the citizens to express thier own thoughts in political. In Electoral College it's not really voting for the president it's for a slate of electors that turns elect the president. This shows that we the ""People"" that have the right to vote who we believe to be the leader for United States we are not really choosing him.

Additional, "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer shows "" the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". This can explain the Electoral College is ""unfair to voters because the winner take all system in each sate"" that means candidates can't spend time in each state getting their chance to win thier vote from the state for the next four years. However, electoral college ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candiate receives a majority of the votes cast"" shown in "" In defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the preseident"" by Richars A. Posner. This can help the candiates to not be a tied so the Electoral College reduced and thiers a clear winner. What if their was a tied would citizens like a machine take thier decision on who's going to be the leader of the United States ? I don't think so becasue a machine doesn't have a right to vote.

In therefore, in 2000 Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote. ""Over 60 percenet of voters would prefer a direct election ... this year voters can expect the popular vote win could again lose the presidency"" explain Plumer. This wasn't the voters decision was the Electoral College we should't have something that doesn't express our right of speech in political. However, the Electoral Collge ""process consists of the slection of the electors, they vote for President and Vice President"" this shows that the citizens can vote to be the most faithful President to be the leader on this opportunity land. To end, we shouldn't keep something that it's not really showing the voice of each citizens on this wonderful world we have as Ameica.

To conclude, we should change election by popular vote for the president of the United States. If we have a tie in the elctoral vote, ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president "" this explain we the citizens didn't chose the president would you like the citizens get mad a make a protest to chose the president ? American would like that so please senator take out the Electoral College becasue you never know if one day the citizens get as one to protest to get rid off the Electoral collge with their power of speech.                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
6E72E9EADF75,""" What's wrong with the Electoral College?"" To be honest, have you ever thought where our vote goes. Just in case you forgot, when we vote we're not voting for the President. We're voting for slate electors who would vote for the President, but how could we be sure that they make the right decision for all Americn Citizens.

I write this letter in favor to inform you that the electoral college is an unfair advantage for American citizens. I see how from a stand point you may trust the electoral college due to abundance of knowledge and critique they have. Yes, I can tell why you'd chose them in a way that they may have strong critique. But how can you trust them with a decision held in their hands with willing citizens to think about. "" At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in  states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "" swing"" states"". Why is it continuing base it off of this knowing how American's feel about this matter? Which brings me back to why Americans have to feel like they have an unfair say on who the President can or could be? Perhaps reasoning is the EC( Electoral College) knows whats best for the American future. Thinking about the effects of the EC voting for the President could possibly vary in results and mat be right. But shine a little light on the situation, it should be in America's people hands and hearts who the president should be.""...  candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no cahnce of winning..."" Why should we feel like that? American's sould have the right to vote for our leader not people who vote for our leader.

Hold on, I'm not finished yet. Another reason why is when American's vote how could we be sure who to vote for. I agree that Americans can make and exercise their decisions when voting  for the Eletoral College. American's are depended on voting , another fact I agree on. But American's sometimes dont know better when voting. "" The American people should consider themselves lucky that the two - thousand fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Sometimes it would be the Americans that throw off the vote for the EC, but in other perspective that wouldn't be the case. Americans should vote wisly upon the information given. but yet the electoral college shouldn't vote for the citizens of the United States, Info should be viewed. I can visaulize someone else perspective it could be with different electorsl parties. But in reverse think about the the biggest election crisis in 2000."" Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". Keeping in mind that we should still vote for our President but at the same keep in mind who citizens are voting for so another voting crisis wouldn't happen again.

In conclusion, I hope you clearly thought it through and thorough. Its hard to rely on other's with a big responsiblity like this. So the Government should let us trust our instincts and but at the same time think them out.                      ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
0CA3A2E98524,"As citizens, we trust our country to do what is best for us. As the statement ""by the people, for the people,"" is commonly used among our government. We hope that this is true. That is why the electoral college should remain a part of how we vote, in order to keep our society fair and in favor of the people.

As it says in ""Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" it states that "" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance."" With this being said, it allows us to know that we can trust our states to be equally represented. Just because the larger states normally get more attention, they are both represented equally. This allowing the votes to be fair and equal.

The electoral college is the reason that run-off elections are avoid. As they produce a clear winner instead of no candidate winning the majority of the votes. run-off election cause the election to become much more complicated than it already is. Also ""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal."" This allows election to be in favor of everyone. Though not everyone may be pleased with the person or their views, it allows the mojority to be on board with one person.

When a president is chosen, it is to allow are country to have a successful leader. Which is why we must trust that what our founding father's put in place is in our favor, and is what should remain as part of our government.

Two hudrend seventy is over half of 538 therefore giving the candiate presidency. ""Your state's entitled allotment of the electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each memebr in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators""(1). This being each state has the same number of senators and one represenative from the House. This seems pretty fair and it lines up with the Electoral College.

While it is true that the Electoral College seems unfair at the most basic level(2), the Electoral College still should not be removed because it keeps the ranks within the elections at peace. Although some may see the Electoral College as unfair, it is just about as fair as popular votes. If the Electoral College were to be abolished then Obama wouldn't have won the Election back in 2012 because the elctions would be based off of popularity and more people were against Obama and wanted a Republican, or Romney.  For example,Obama wouldn't have had as fair of a chance as he did in 2008 if the Elcetoral College would have been abolished within the next four years when he ran again. He probably would have lost in 2012 because he didn't win the popular vote and that is what the country would be going by if the were no more Electoral College. This causes people to think that the Electoral College is unfair because Obama won.

This debate is able to go either way because if winning was based on popularity then one candidate would win but the loosing candidates supporters blaim it on the Electoral College, but on the other hand, if Electoral Colleges were banned, then the another candicate would win and the loosing candidates supporters would blame it on elections being based on popularity vote. It is unfair in the loosing team's side so in other words elections are all unfair. For example, ""Back in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legistlature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

6A099CADF367,"Dear Senator,

After doing some background research on the theme of the electoral college, i have realized that this system is wrong and should be changed. Now you msy aks yourself why?. Here are my reasons on why to exterminate the electoral college. And my ideas on what is going to replace it.

What the electoral college does is basically a chain of votes. Meaning someone votes for someone and then that someone votes for another someone. This may seem confusing, and personally i think it is!. Why vote for a slate of electors when we could vote for the president. I mena is like skipping a step of the sequence(a very complex sequence)

dont you think its easier, faster, better and less confusing to just vote for the president. Every single citizen votes for who they want. thats why i propose an idea. this idea is easier, faster and better...

Mr/Ms Senator lets apply the election by popular vote system. its less confusing and less biased. For ex. if u want to vote for ""Tim Hart""for president, you just have to vote simple right; now using the other system you have to vote for the group of democtratic people that is voting for Tim Hart. And then hope that they didnt steal your vote, and they voted for another candidate. You see what im saying her. The system of popular election vote is way safer than the electoral college.

Also this system is more equal than the other, speaking of the problem of small states. Ex ""large states gets more attention form presidential candidates than a small state does""(4 big states, P 21 L 10). This shows that the electoral college system is unequal. Now in the other hand with our system , no matter small or large states, everyone will get the same attencion.

To conclude this essay the election by popular vote is clearly safer, faster, better and more equal than the electoral college, this is why i ask you if you could just think about the idea, and share the word with your collics and people you know

66B20410E2E1,"Dear Senator PROPER_NAME,

The purpose of this letter is to fight for the cause of removing the Electoral College and voting simply by popular vote. With eveidence from ""What is the Electoral College?'' by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" by Richard A. Ponser, I will eleborate on this subject. Now, since I am only fourteen, I do not claim to have all knowledge and be an expert on this method of voting, but it is not the way to choose our country's leader.

The Electoral College is a compromise between who the people of America chose and who Congress has chosen. This is an incorrect method of selecting the President. The Constitution states that we the people have the choice to select our government; not Congress. Yes, the Constitution's founding fathers also established the Electoral College, but it is a thing of the past. As Richard A. Ponser writes, an ""anchorism"" (In Defense of the Electoral College, par. 1), if you will. Moreover, the Electoral College does not belong in this day and age; it is something that is out-dated and in need of replacement.

The Electoral College also does not allow citizens to exersize their right to vote for their President, since Congress also has their say in the matter. The voting process was created for the citizens; not the people who are in the government. In fact, Bradford Plumer states that ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" (The Indefensible Electoral College, par. 1) This process of voting for President is undesired and despised my many people, by over half of the voters in America. The Office of the Federal Register writes that the Electoral College is ""a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" Why does Congress have any sort of influence or say in this matter? The people choose their government; not the governemt itself!

Alright, the Electoral College is something that should not be used, by I can see the point of its purpose. The popular vote of the citizens can be infulenced by others, or advertisements and propoganda from political parties. Some voters are biased and overlook the negative things of the candidates because they do not wish to believe that this person does not support or believe everything they do. The Electoral College helps to balance that out. ""No region... has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" (In Defense of the Electoral College, par.  5) Richard A. Ponser asserts this in his article, as well as the fact that no region or place has any reason to go about ""increasing his plurality"" (par. 5) to make sure that a candidate will win. The Electoral College prevents this, resulting in a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and Congress.

To come to a conclusion, I have stated that the Electoral College is not a method that should be used to choose the President of the United States. It is out-dated and does not allow citizens to choose the leader of their country. However, is balances out the popular vote and the Congress's vote.

CAE2A78F6FF2,"The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. The Electoral College should be kept in use because it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election, but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.

In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advangate of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election."" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them. People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them, but this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller states's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states.

Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. "" Most states have a winner-take-all system that  awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country. It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count, but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote.

In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.    ",6,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
09CB71A747DF,"To whom it may concern, I have recently been enlightened on what Electoral College is all about. According to ""What Is the Electoral college?"" Electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. As quoted also from ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

First of all, the Electoral College should be kept because no, one region has the ability to elect a president. A certain region can gather all it's people to favorite one of the candidates, but it still won't be enough to reach a biased conclusion in the final election. The candidates also cannot count on one of their favorite states or rven regions for them to win because, with only regional or state appeal, it will become unlikely for them to be a successful president.

In addition, having The Electoral College will ensure that the larger states can't overrule the smaller state based on population. It balances the weight of more populated states to smaller populated states. This is good because now, the smaller populated states will feel that they actually have power in the Election process instead of feeling left out due to a larger population. This is also significant because now the candidates won't aim their campaigning only towards the higher populated states. They will go all around the country trying to emphasize their importance in winning the campaign.

In conclusion, the obvious solution here is to keep using the Electoral College process. It not only ensures that one state or region does not have enough votes alone to sway the election, it allows the smaller populated states to have just as big of a say in the election as the larger states. The procedure of using The Electoral college has been around for quite a while now and it's clear why. It is the most beneficial way of ensuring that the right candidate will get into office, based off of the right terms.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
515E8B741A54,"Dear Senator,

I think that you should help change the way we vote. In my opinion, its complete nonsense that this ""Electoral College"" process is used. If there are citizens who want a good president, and the Congress wants different, it's pretty obvious that the citizens are going to be beyond disappointed that someone different was chosen.

First off, I suggest that some states stop using the ""winner-takes-all"" system. I think that process is outrageous. Do you really think this process is choosing the right person to run our country? Just because the Congress likes this system, doesn't mean we, the people of the United States, preferably enjoy it.

Next, I believe that we should be able to choose our electors, because some people in the government make mistakes. Sometimes people are wrong about other people. Each state only casts one vote, so we better make the best out of it, right?

Also, there is a few reasons why this process is good. One reason why is because if there wasn't this secure system, it would probably be total chaos. Another reason is that this system helps choose which president will do the better for the United States.

9F3DA961A0F9,"Dear,

State Senator:

I am writing you this letter today to tell you that we should change the elction by popular vote for the president of the United States. At the most, the electoral college is extremely unfair to the voters, and the system allows much worse disaster than the fiasco that happened in 2000.

The electoral college is unfair to the voters voting for the president and other candidiates. Using the ""Winner-Take-All"" system, the voters know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the states also. All because they can't spend time in states.

Also, voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors who vote for the president. Get this, if you lived in Texas, and you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pleadged on him. Don't forget that there is the off chance that those electors won the stateside election, they would go to Congress and John Kerry would get 34 electoral votes but, who are they electors? I'll tell you, they can be anyone not holding public office.

Also, another reason why the Electoral College should be vacant, is because of the what happened in 2000. During the 2000 campaign, 17 states did not see the candidiates at all!

Those sates would include, Rhode Island, and South Carolina. Also, voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign add. Not one, and the electoral college has the power to make things worse than what happened in 2000.

It's no secret anymore, the electoral college is unfair, irrational, and outdated. We should not let the electoral college get away with what they are doing! completley unfair to the voters and another fiasco like 2000, or even worse than that can start up again. It's hard, it's very hard for me the say this, but I know, and you know that Bob Dole was right, we need to abolish the electoral college!

I hope you have the time the read this letter and seriously think about making some changes. I don't know much about politics but, I do know that what the electoral college is doing is not right at all. They are cheating voters just like they have been donig since 2000, maybe even a long time before that.

8B5A7E5D7BB5,"I would keep the Electoral Collage. So we can still vote for President and also Vice President. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state puposes of ElectoralCollage.

Each candidate running for President has his or her own group of electors. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a ""winner take all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

The Electoral Collage is windely regared as anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirly possible that the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43  percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral Collage 301 and 370 electoral votes respectively.         ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
6AFC2BA228ED,"Dear, Senator of Florida

After reading this story/argument i think we should remove the Electoral college, why? Because i think we shoud be able to have the final vote, not the electoral voters. It states in paragraph 15 that ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" (paragraph 15) the reason why is cause they vote on the more who has the responsibility on taking part as president.

The electoral college has 538 electors and about 270 electoral vote are required to elect president. There is one member of the house in your state of representatives also 2 for your senate. But in the district of columbia therenis allocated 3 electors that are treated like a state. This election is held every four yearson the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. So when you vote, you dont vote for the whivh presidnt your actualy voting for the candidtes electors.

""It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win national popular vote. But in the year 2000, Gore had more popular votes then Bush,and Bush had less fewer electoral votes. This yet has not happened very rarely, but it was the first time ever since 1888."" That only happened cause the elctoral votes made it happen. some informstion i put up there is to inform you what they do and how many votes are required to elect president compared to the thousands of people voting for the president.

I say that the electoral college is unfair! why? well there's resons. The first is cause they lost the presidency the year 2000 with Gore and Bush. Second of all people who favored the seperation of race.

We, people shoud be able to vote on the president to make our vote count! Not on just voting for the electors the elect the president. Let our votes be heard to the people not the just the elctoral college.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

C86A77CEF091,"The Electoral College is a process that has been used for presidential elections since the Founding Fathers established it in the Consitution. This system does not necessary give the voters a direct vote, but rather a vote for a slate of electors that vote for them. The voters intrust that their elected slate will vote for their favored presidential canidate. It brings up the argument whether this system of voting should be changed or kept. The Electoral College has some of its good points, but over all, it needs to be changed. Voters need a direct say in their vote, and this system turns off the interest of potiential voters.

The voters of the United states should have the ability to directly vote for who they want as President. After all, the people are what make up the country and should have say. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer in

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong .

This means that the Electoral College is unfair to the people because the slate they vote for might not even vote for their canidate. Also, in the same article, Plumer states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This means that there is a chance that the electors could vote for whoever they please.

This system of voting does not give the voters a direct say as to who they want, but also turns off the interest of voters who should be voting for their country. ""Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know that have no chance of winning..."" as said by Plumer. People within those states would have no motivation to vote for their president because their potienial president did not come to their state to convince them to vote. The canidates are only focused on getting majority of the electoral votes, and not who the people really want. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets ddin't get to see a single campaign ad,"" Plumer had stated. These states lack any information about the potiential ruler of their country just because the canidates are focused on the states that will help them win.

Although ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for a party's nominee,"" as said by Richard A. Posner in

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , the possibility of having a winner based on electoral vote and not popular vote is very much possible. For instance, the 2000 election, Gore had won popular vote but due to the electoral vote, Bush had won the election. Gore won the vote for the most popular all over the nation, but because the electoral college had a majority of Bush, it was like the nation's actual vote did not matter.

The Electoral College is unfair to the people because they do not get a direct say for who they want, and the canidates only focus on states that will help them win based on electoral vote. The people need a say exactly who they want and should not depend on others to do the vote for them. Canidates should not only appeal to states that would make them win, but also to other states so the whole nation knows exactly who might be ruling over their country.

7C7CD7817ECF,"Dear every state senator of the United States of America and the District of Colombia, the Electoral College has an unfair sysytem. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The citizens of the U.S doesn't have a say in the desicion of whose going to be their countries leader. Hopefully these senators come to realize that it is a fair oppurtunity if citizens also have a say when the desicions are being made. For the good of the United States of America and the District of Colombia, Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America would be an amazing change.

To commence with, citizens don't have a say in whose their leader. According to the Office of the Federal Register, ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."" No where in the process of deciding which president should be chosen , does a citizen have a say in who they want. These are citizens who work and give tax money to the state and help the important people like the senators, presidents , vice president etc., they deserve respect and have a chance to be a part of a popular vote for the president of the united states of America. Although having popular vote can still fail to satysify some masses of people , it is a way where everyone could be involved in fair desicions. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" The man said it himself. Bradford Plumer is against having the Electoral system. Hopefully one day state senators of the U.S. and the District of Colombia doesn't fail to realize that their system of voting for the president and vice president are unfair to the Citizens of their country. Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America instead of the electoral college because citizens aren't having a say in any important decisions.

Furthermore, desicions may fall into the wrong hands. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.)"" The election is only a few swing voters away from a disaster. What if the house of representatives only has one political party? then does the president who is in that political party always win? There are so many reasons why citizens should have a chance to have vote by direct popular votes, that way descions wont fall into the wrong hands.

36FCA185E7E3,"The Electoral College was a system thought up by people who lived in a time much different than our own. And in that time, it made sense. It made sure that those who cast their state's votes for president, the electors, were well informed on the issues and the stance of the candidates for those issues. However, now that everyone has access to a wealth of information through the internet, newspapers and television, this is no longer a problem; this is why election by popular vote would be a better system.

With the Electoral College, voters don't have a direct say on who becomes president. They have to trust their votes in the hands of people they don't even know. People who could cast their state's votes for any candidate they want. This system is completely unnecessary now that citizens have a wealth of information about the candidates and their stance on certain topics.

If our nation switched to election by popular vote, everyone's vote would matter. In the Electoral College system, many people in states that are decisively one way or the other, don't vote, knowing that the overwhelming majority of the population of their state is against them. This makes certain people, like Democrats in Texas or Republicans in California, feel that their vote has no power. In an election by popular vote however, every vote matters because the people's votes directly decide the president.

Our Founding Fathers were geniuses to have come up with a system that worked so well in their time, however, old methods don't always stand the test of time. Election by popular vote makes more sense in today's world.  The Electoral College eliminates the power of some people's votes and puts those that matter in the hands of people who could do whatever they want with them. This is why election by popular vote would be a better system for determining the president than the Electoral College.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

It is better to send votes by computer because all you have to do is click a button and the the vote is sent to the elector.

Under the 23rd admendment of the constitution 3 elctors were allocated in the district of columbia. The electors are to be treated like a state for a purpose. As stated in (what is the electoral collage)'' the word state also refers to the district of columbia. Therefore the electoral collage selectes each candidate runnig for president.

A1B2F28757E3,"Voting, one of the most American things I can thing of. This is a democracy, and we have the right to vote for our leader, but not really. There is a thing called the Electoral College, and the electors that you vote for actually vote for the president. Although this does not seem fair, it is a great system. Almost every time your state votes for an Elector, he picks the President that your state wants. So it really is a great deal.

My opponents belive that the president should be voted by popular vote, but i disagree. Richard Posner, writer for slate magizine writes that this method is non-democatic, and should be overruled(source 3, paragraph 15). Although you are not actuially voting for president, you are voting for who votes for president. This method equals out the playing field for states. Insted of all the power going to states like California or Texas. Presidents have to fight for every state. Posner also writes, sometimes the person with the popular vote will not win the election, like in 2000(source 3, paragraph 16). Although this was a huge disaster, it was the first time something like this has happened since 1888. Also, 4 years later George Bush won the election again, but for real.

Some may say that America is not filled with the smartest, or brightest people. So you belive that we should hold the fate of who will be president in the hands of an adult who cant spell his own name. Someone ike that has as much power as a guy who has watched every debate, and has done research. So by voting for a democrate elector, your state will vote for a democratic president, if your state votes in a republican elector, then your state will vote for a republican president. It is as simple as that.

The Electoral college provides a point system for every state. the biggest are California with 55, and Texas with 38. The smallest are the Dakotas, and they each are worth 3 points. The point system is based on population, and how many representitives you have. One of the best parts of this is that every state get attencion. Without this system, the candidates would only go to campien at the highest populated states. Then this would cause the smaller states to think that their votes don't matter, and then one day we are going to have a bad guy as our leader.

In conclusion, I belive the Electoral College is a great system, and I hope it lives on. Although it is not really Democratic, it still is a better system than what my oppents belive we should do. This gives us a certantity of oucome, a president that everyone supports, swing states, big states, and helps to avoid run-off elections.

To begin with, the Electoral College has been the method we have used for years for choosing our next President, so why would we change it now? Well, the answer is we shouldn't. It may seem like a good idea at first to change to the election by popular vote, but here's the problem. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral College is what helps the candidates from winning from a landslide. The Electoral consists of 583 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is reqquired to elect the President. So even though some may say you're not choosing your President, you're actually helping to chose your President. When you vote you're actually voting for an elector that will (most likely) vote for the candidate to your appeal.

Furthermore, many people such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and even the Chamber of Commerce have agreed to abolish the Electoral College. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Although, this all may seem like a time for change, isn't the Electoral College doing us a favor? ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" The Electoral College is a process, as a compromise established by our founding fathers, between election of the President by a vote in cCongress  and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

Last, but not least, the Electoral College helps with voting for President. ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed."" It is possible for the winner to win the electoral vote, but will not win the national popular vote. ""The Electoral College requires a candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" ""So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, that he knows he will will."" Therefor, he will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in those states in favor of him. ""This is a desirable result because the candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.

Goodmoring senator before I start , I would like to ask how are you doing and how's your family. I hope everybody health is great and family problems. Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. Electoral College is not a good idea for us citizens. Because everybody in this country that works and come from another country , should be able to vote for their President. The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.

According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. Also  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!

In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.

A23FF67A91B5,"Dear Senator, the election is coming up soon and so is voting. The Electoral College and the popular vote get to select the president of the United States every year. I want this year to be a little different. This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president. The Electoral College knows all about thinking if the president is good enough for the country, and if he can be a good role model, or also a commander in chief. That is the reason why I would like to keep the Electoral College.

I would like the country to keep the Electoral College because they make good desiciosns, know if the candidate person is the right president, and last but not least they might think if the citizens would like this president based on his promises that he would like to keep. For example there are two candidates fighting to be president and it's time to vote and the Electoral College might look over  to see if the president looks like he can keep his promise to keep the coutnry safe, to make this a better country or not . That's what they look for in a president. That's the reason wwhy we should keep the Electoral College.

When the citizens want to vote for the president as well, they think of the same thing, if he's good enough for our country, and if he is going to keep us safe. The Electoral College knows a lot about picking the right president and they've been doing it for a long time.

""The Electoral College consits of 538 electors and a  majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.

I believe that the idea of a popular vote to elect the president is a way better idea than Electoral College. In Electoral college your vote actually goes to the electors of the canidates, and they get to elect the president. So in a way people don't really get who they vote for. "" When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors "", proof there to tell you the president you want is not really who you're voting for. "" Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election like we have now "" direct evidence that shows more people want a direct vote so they arn't being lied to, get worried or even angry. The winner-take-all system really had an effect on the people in the past due the way some states could never see the candidates so they knew that they had no chance of winning. Now Electoral College may be unfair and outdated but some people still support it and like the ways of it.

The Electoral College is considered an anachronism, or just not fit best for the present time. Basically each party selects electors and then they vote for that party's nominee. The winner-take-all method is really what the Electoral college is all about, what is does is gets voters in toss up states to pay close attention to the campaign and on average are the most thoughtful voters and on average usually decide who will win the election. The Electoral College usually balences the voting considering large states gets more attention from presidential campaigns then a small state would ""... restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states  lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution "". Although some people want a political reference rather then one single vote deciding on who the winner of the election is.

In conclusion I agree more on the side of a popular vote rather than the Electoral College. It just has a more fair advantage and it supports my claim, popular voting is more fair, most supported and just overall better for the time being.

An electoral college is unfair. In source two, it says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" This shows that candidates don't treat everyone the same. They spend more time in states that have a chance of winning. Some states never even get to see who the candidates are.

Not only are electoral colleges unfair, they're also outdated. The electoral college has been being used since 1960. In source two, it says, "" It happened in Hawaii in 1960."" This proves that the electoral college has been around for many years, and it's time for something new. Things change along with time, a new system would improve voting.

The electoral college is irrational. In an electoral college, you don't vote for the president, you vote for a slate of electors that then vote for the president. In source two, it says, ""Under the electoral college  system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This proves that the system doesn't make sense and citizens should be able to directly vote for the president of their country.

21CB2FC1D56F,"The United States of America is constantly referred to as the ""Land of the Free"", but if

America really was the land of those who are free, why can't an American Citizen vote for their presidential candidate? It's ridiculous that people have to spend a day voting for a group of people who then will vote for the presidential candidate they want. It's a waste of time. The election should be changed to popular vote due to the fact that their is always the uncertainty of which presidential candidate the elector will ultimately choose, American Citizens don't get the option to have their political voices heard, and there is a lack of representation.

When the American citizen chooses the electors that are in favor of who they want, they have no idea whether or not the elector they choose will ultimately select the presidential candidate they want. As Bradford Plumer states in

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people."" There is no absolute guarantee that the elector selected will vote for that presidential candidate which is one of the many reasons that the electoral college could result in something disastrous.

It almost seems pointless to even have American Citizens vote. They do not vote for the presidential candidates of their choice. As written in paragraph 10 of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, bur for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" It's much simpler to just vote directly for the president that way it is easier to determine and makes so that every vote counts.

The electoral college does not fully represent every single citizen in a state. Richard A.

Posner in

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president , that,""..the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carryint their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California."" There are states that are mostly one certain political party, so of course they will want to vote for their party's presidential candidate. This causes the other party's vote to be practically irrelevant which will cause a person to not even bother voting.

The electoral college is outdated and should be changed. The popular vote represents every citizen fairly. It also is directly voting for the presidential candidate instead of voting for a group of electors that is just a waste of time. Popular vote eliminates the uncertainty that electors bring. Overall, popular vote is a winning situation for all of America and causes the title ""Land of the Free"" to actually apply and make sense.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
129427624B81,"I profoundly believe that the United States should not keep the Electoral College because the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency, and the ""winner take all"" system causes voters in certain states to not feel like they are creating an impact. The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established in the constition. The electoral college consits of 538 electors and a majority of 278 votes.

In our voting system even if a candidate receives more votes than their opponents he or she still could lose the election because of the electoral college. Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college.

Additionally the winner take all method in some states makes voters feel unimportant. Some may argue that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president but regions do have the power to swing an election in an enourmous way. An effect of the winner take all system is candidates not going to certain states if they know they can not win it. This can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make no difference. In the 2000 election ""17 states did not see candidates at all."" according to Bradford Plumer. How could somebody possibly feel engaged in an election if whoever is running finds there vote unimportantant to them winning the election.

In conclusion it is official that the electoral collage is unfair, out dated, and irrational. With that being said we should abolish it because it stops the voter who has the majority of votes from winning, and can undoubtably make voters feel unimportant.

The state senator should consider changing election to popular vote for the president of the united states because its the peoples choice and its more safe route.

secondly, getting rid of the electoral college would benefit the entire world because this nation called the united sates is a democracy it is ruled for the people and by the people, when the government descides to go by the electoral college votes thats not ruling by the people because our nation dosent only consists of 538 electors we each have our own voices. we consists of 50 states all together if the government cant conduct electoral colleges in each state then it shouldnt be around in the first, we the people all have different opinions and outlooks on the universe it shouldnt only be counted for about 538 electors it unfair. and god knows where the electoral colleges are held and if they are being completely fair to everyone their are their all ethnicities from all over the nation, is it normal people that have nine to five jobs so they understand the struggles of an average person making 60,000 dollars a year, or are they picking business men and housewives that live in suburben neighborhoods.

21B7E5DC72D6,"The system of Electoral College is being always used in Presidental elections every first Thursday in November, hapenning in a space of fours years each electio.

The biggest problem with this system is that you do not vote directly to your president, you are voting for a candidate's electors. The real decision is not made by the people of the society themselves, but made by a group of people who whave the freedom to choose the candidate that they feel pleased with. Another point is that some of this electors don't even vote for their paty's candidates.

If it doesn't look like a big deal, first it's important no analyze the profile of the electors, the ones who decide the future of our country and the authorty of our nation. Do they have something special? Something that differenciate them for the other voters? Actually no! There's no criterion, according with Bradford Plumer in '' The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong'', the selection of the electors ''depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comitee, sometimes the presidental candidates themselves''.

The last point is that the few electors can't represent the will of a whole state, in ''The Indefensible Electoral College'', shows that just 55 representatives from California, represent 35 million voters, it's impossible to attend the rights of each one of these people.

After all, we need to realize that it's a unfair system for regular voters, for the population in general that has the expection of changing something, but actually are being controled for a group.

The electors may only vote for who they want rather than go with the vote of the people which is why I beleive the president should be elected by popular vote. This would also mean there would never be a tie. In the event of a tie the House of Representatives would take the vote. So the representative of Wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have the same power of as the representative of California, representing 35 million voters. it should be quite clear why popular vote would make more sense.

F01C08F2B1C8,"Many people feel that the president plays a very imperative role in the United States. He has much responsibility and an enormous influence on what this country stands for. So, surely, this president must be carefully sought out from the abundance of other candidates. It is quite contreversial as to what method is best for selecting them. Although an electoral college may appear as the right path, the countries interest unvariably lies with the popular vote because it is fair and unstressful unlike the electoral college.

Firstly, the electoral college is quite unfair. It is mentioned by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" that some of the states do not even get to see candidates under the electoral college system. Candidates don't even bother with the states that they don't have a chance of winning over. They focus all of their attention on swings states. This means that some states have to vote based on just what they have heard. These people could have heard rumors and now are voting under false impressions. They deserve their own fair share of information from the candidates themselves. Also, under the electoral college the people of this nation aren't even voting for their president. They are voting for the electors. All that they can do is hope that the person that they voted for votes in their favor (Plumer). There is no guarentee that they will, so people have little say in who is president. This is their country, they should be able to decide who does and doesn't govern it. It is mentioned that with the popular vote larger states get more attention than little ones (Posner). The popular vote may not be entirely fair to all states, but it most definitely is better than the electoral college. Even Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO agree that the electoral college should be abolished.

As if this wasn't enough to get rid of the electoral system, the popular vote is also much less stressful. First off, the there could be a tie. If there is a tie, the decision goes to the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is likely that the result of their voting will not be at the will of the people (Plumer). Isn't it just easier to have their load lightened and take the stress of thep possibility off thier back? Although the outcome of a tie is unlikely (Posner) it is still possible and causing unnecessary stress. Additionally, the electoral college results in the presence of the disaster factor (Plumer). If a repeat of the 2000 fiasco (the biggest election crisis in the past hundred years (Plumer)) is what America is looking for then by all means choose to stick with the electoral college.

In summation, it is prominent that the most potent option for this naiton is to elect the president of the United States by popular vote. Even though the electoral college does have some pros, the ultimate candidate is the popular vote as it ensures fairness and a virtually stressless voting process. Who doesn't want that?

D1DBC69FA526,"Does we are really voting for the elector or someobody else?, sometimes elections can be unfair but one of the best methos and the one more easily to understand and fair is by electing the president by popular vote.

To beging with,every state should be treatly the same, have the respect campaings and no one state should have advantage or disadvante at the time of voting because sometimes representatives can give a advantage or a disadvantage and sometimes can give a catasrophic decision, but also more power for bigger sates that represents 35 million voters like california.""given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people"".

other example of this can be seen in te elections of 2000,""seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including rhole island and south california,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And this just show how when we have electoral collegue can be a disadvantage for candidates, if they know they are not going to win they don't focus on those states,and some people who want to have more options or listen to other persons they cant because they dont see a campaign to convice them.

In summary,its better to the winner to take all cause almost half of the population agrred with the candidate thinking and maturity to select whats best to others,but also whe you are voting fot the state elector you cant control their final vote and sometimes you don't choose who you is your state elector and you don't now if he has the best wisenes to decide,if two presidents in popupal vote get close that mean that  a lot of people agreed with the same person,but that doesnt happen when we have electoral because its just a minimum number and we dont now if everybody in the state really agreed with the representator.

To summarize,if we want a fair election and be part of it, listen to others options, have part of the the decision of our president , and be trheated the same and the our vote really counts we should elect by popular vote.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1AAA1DEF3B00,"Dear Mr. President,

After reading informative essays on the Electoral College, i believe the Electoral College should be retired and change the election to popular vote during the election of our United States' president.

Although the Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution (What is the Electoral College?, 1) it can cause something known as the disaster factor. This happened back in 1960 and 2000. John F. Kennedy was almost replaced by the Democratic electors who nearly succeeded opposing him (The Indefensible Electoral College, 3).

Another worry factor of the electoral vote is a tie. This could mean putting the election of the president into the hands of the Senate. This also makes Wyoming, who has one representative, have equal say with a state like California, who has fifty-five represenatives (The Indefensible Electoral College, 12). This allows for the opposite of the will of the people. Isn't that what we want? The will of the people.

The winner-take-all system in every state also makes the electoral college unfair to voters (The Indefensible Electoral College, 13). Putting the decision of our US president in the hands of a few voters in one state while others don't even get to see the candidates is absolutely unjust.

Although, there are a few reasons we should keep the electoral college. With the electoral college there is always a certainty of outcome (In Defense of the Electoral College, 18). This means that a candidate's electoral college votes exceeds popular vote. This cuts out the factor of a lanslide electoral vote in only one state; keeping in line the will of the people.

The Electoral College process of voting during election time is old, outdated, and unfair to our voting population. As a United States citizen, i think we should leave the election of our president up to popular vote; everyone will have a say and it takes out al the complications of electoral votes and representatives and most imporatantly takes the exact decisions of the will of the people.

Thank you for your time and taking my claims into consideration.

Sure it has some flukes in the system but many can be buffered. Some problems can be fix, but we deffinitaly don't need to switch it up. for the Electoral College each party is eqaul in the race for president. Each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen from by the candidates political party, the states vary on how they are to be selected. You help choose your stat's elector when you vote for president,  really because you vote for your candidate you really are actually voting for your candidate selected electors. After these few steps in the Electorical College once all the voting is settled a Certifcate of Ascertainment also declares the winning predsidential candidate in your state at a meeting in December of election year. The certificate is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of offical records to the presidential election, then you wait.

Now, some people disagree with me on not keeping the old method.

I strongly disagree with that quote because the voter no matter what is voting for there side. Weather they are voting for democrate, or republican the vote goes to an elector and then brought to state, which goes in as a vote for presidence. another quote released "" It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". Now how is that qouted true when for years the Electorial College has worked everytime.

Finally, the reasons on why we should keep the same method. The reasons on why we should keep these methods in general. These reasons are Certainty of Outcome, Swinging States, Big States, and the Avoidence  of Run-Off elections. All these reasons are valid reasons on why we should keep the sam method. Certainty of outcome we always have and outcome and rarly a problem. We have swinging states which gives each candidate a equal fight. Also big states in which can cause can great break through for a candidate if they win the state over. These are all valid reasons on for why we should keep the electorial college going.

11C341083061,"We should keep with changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Because it is logical and is very fair, these are my reasons why.

For one, it seems a lot more leveled out. The Electoral College is not as fair, because the electors help the president, the the president helps the electors. They could have past experience or an old relationship of some sort. Braford Plumer quotes, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" He clearly says Electoral College needs to be abolished, over & done with. Because they don't have logical information on everything they do. And they only have practical reasoning, not liberal or conservative reasoning.

Next reason, their method is not bulletproof as they claim it to be. No method is perfect, but the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope in succeeding. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..."" He is saying the way the method is set up, makes it seem worthless to even vote for the person you choose or chose.

Finally, my last reason to why we should keep with changing to election by popular vote is confusion. The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Some candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning because of the winner-take-all system. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is pretty selffish and ridiculously unfair.

However, having the election by popular vote has it's flaws as well. Such as the certainty of outcome. Electoral College having a dispute over the outcome of an election is possible, but it's less likely than the popular vote. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Because almost all states award elecroral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""

He is simply stating that if there is a difficulty in the popular vote election, they have an electoral vote to choose the winner.

Those are my very important, detailed reasons why we should change to election by popular vote. Recap, fairness is important & is needed in any method, the Electoral College method is not as solid as they believe it to be, & all of the confusion the Electoral College puts off to some states.             ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

C86C5C69277C,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I would like to argue with your decision of getting rid of the electoral college. I would like to argue with you because the Electoral college is a piece of history, we could some problems if we keep the electoral college, but there are a bit of problems with this voting system. So Senator this is my letter that i want you to read so you can rethink the decision of getting rid of the Electoral college.

The Electoral college is a voting system that depends on the popular votes to see who gets the electoral votes in the president race. The founding fathers established the electoral college in the constitution, which means this voting system has been with this country since the beginning of the United States. To get rid of the Electoral college is like getting rid of a piece of this country. The founding fathers made the electoral college so the president and vice president could get chosen. There are five hundred and thirty eight electoral votes possible to get. To win presidency you must have two hundred and seventy electoral votes. These votes are one of the most important things. So I want you Senator to imagine getting rid of a piece of the constitution, just imagine ripping a little piece off. Guess what you can't because the constitution is to important to this country to take anything off of it. This is one reason Senator that the electoral college should not be disbanded.

The Electoral College has the ability to get rid off problems such as avoiding run off elections, which means that no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also has swing states, which means the people in the state pay close attention to what the candidates say and vote for who they feel should win so that the winner take all method isn't in effect. A good example of a run-off election is the elections of Richard Nixon and Bill clinton. Both of these presidents had forty three percent of the populare votes, but dominated in the electoral votes. A good example of a winner take all method is the election of 2012 where the candidates focused on the voters in the toss up states or the states that listen and vote for who they think is better. Another example of a run-off election is if a candidate does not win a majority of the votes vast than the presidential election would be greatly complicated. The complication is then reduced by the Electoral College, which chooses a winner. The Electoral College can save a lot of things for just a voting system.

Although the Electoral College helps a lot there is a couple problems with it. When you vote you vote for who you want to vote for, but when that vote gets put in the Electoral College doesn't have to put there vote to who you voted for. The Electoral College is also unfair to voters because of the winner take all system. During the 2000 campaign some states didn't even get to see their candidates. Some states didn't even get to see a ad on tv for their candidates. The Electoral College is also known as the disaster factor because of the crisis in the election of 2000. The electors are chosen by the legislatures and the electors could always defy the will of the people. The Electoral College can be fixed, so don't take it way that way it can be fixed and arranged.

The Electoral College is good because it keeps us away from problems, even though it has some, and is a part of our history. This whole letter is to explain why you the senator should not take the electoral college away. I have to say it has problems, but those problems can be fixed by some simple solution.

C455B6E68885,"The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way on deciding who's president. The electoral college seem's to have many flaw's that can make voting a disaster. Voter's aren't truely voting for a president, they vote for a slate of canidates who then vote for president.

The worst part about this type of voting is the disaster factor (sourse 2:paragraph 11). It clearly says '' segragationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeede in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. This shows that the results of an electoral college can sometimes not be decided by the people, but mostly on the electors of each state. People say the the electoral college is an easier,cleaner, and faster method, but when it comes for the people to vote for president; The electoral college system wont suit what the people mainly would like.

The electoral college is an unfair way to vote for president, During the 2000 campian program, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.(sourse 2: paragraph 13). These things shows that the candidates dont care about having the smaller states votes, but wants bigger populated states like california and texas. This is often called a '' Winner-take-all'' system since it each state doesn't get to see what there elector is really all about. Also it can show  that with the electoral college, electors can vote for a president who is regionally favorable and not nationaly. This can often make the voters feel less satisfied with thier president since there president might not show intrest in there opinions.

The Electoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which there is little  to no popular votes what so ever. Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral College (sourse 3: paragraph 22).This goes to show that the Peoples votes dont usually matter when it comes to voting for a president but the electors do.

Once agian,The senate should remove the Electoral college and make the popular vote system the main way of deciding who's president. This will be benifitial to many states that want to be involved in the election but feel that there saying in things wouldn't matter.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
DE1EF5A9F3AA,"The Electoral College is a system of electing our president created by our founding fathers when they were writing the Constitution.  Lately though, people have opposed the Electoral College due to the election when Al Gore beat George Bush in the popular vote, but lost the electoral vote(and a seat as President.)

Based on many sources, I do not support the Electoral College because of the lack of a direct link from the public to the election of the president and the unfairness of it towards voters.

I do not support the Electoral College because of a lack of a direct link from the public to the election of the president.  Instead of the public voting for the president, they are voting for a group of electors who, in turn, elect the president.  The problem with that is that the group of electors can be anyone not holding the public office.  But just in case of dishonest electors, states hold state conventions to pick the electors.  But even after this, voters still can not control who their state's electors vote for.  Sometimes, electors get confused about who someone voted for and put them down for a candidate different from whom they originally voted for.  Now we could avoid all this trouble if we just did away with Electoral College and had a direct vote for president, and have the election ""by the people and for the people"" instead of ""by the people and for the electors.""

I do not support the Electoral College because of the unfairness of it towards the voters.  Due to the winner take all system in each state, candidates for president don't focus on winning every state.  Instead, they focus on only winning the ""swing"" states, or, states whose political party support is constantly changing.  In the presidential election of 2000, the presidential candidates didn't see 17 states(including, but not limited to, Rhode Island and South Carolina) and 25 of the largest media markets' voters didn't see a single presidential campaign ad.  This is another good reason to get rid of the Electoral College.

Based on this evidence, I believe the Elelectoral College should be done away with because of a lack of a direct link to the election of the president and the unfairness of it towards voters.     ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
35A6B9856702,"The Electoral College is not a fair system for voting and shouldn't be continued because of a few major flaws. There is no guarentee that the president with the highest votes will be elected. Also, the system isn't balanced among all of the states. Because some people know these things, potential voters have decided it isn't worth it if who they elected isn't gaurenteed to win.

People vote because they want to be able to choose who will be their president, however the Electoral College doesn't allow the elective with the highest votes to become the president. ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Also, just because the people vote for electors for a certain president, the elector can still vote for whoever they want to. ""'Faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.""

The system also is not fair to different states. ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" The larger states give more votes so they are usually given more attention by presidential candidates.

Lastly, the people who know that their votes are just suggestions have been turned off from voting. Maybe they know they have a candidate ""who has no hope of carrying their state."" I have noticed that some citizens are not qualified to vote because there are some who vote carelessly and do not carefully construct all of the things the electives are saying and how it could benefit or harm our country. However, there are some people, like the one's in the ""toss-up states"", who, in turn, ""are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign--to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing that they are going to decide the election."" Just because some people choose not to take it seriously does not mean you should take the right away from everyone.

These three reasons are key points as to why I think we should take out the Electoral College and begin letting the people decide who will be the president. It's not a fair, balanced system. There's no guarantee that the person with the highest number of votes will be elected, and, because of that, it can turn off potential voters from having their say on who the president should be.

The Electoral College proccess does not give the citizens all of the power that they shoud be entitled to. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (p10) If a United States citizen wanted to vote for a certain candidate, they would vote for electors pledged to that candidate instead of directly voting for them. As a government who is ""run by the people"", the government surely has strict power over things that should be left up to the people to decide. The eloctoral college is unfair and quite confusing to the citizen of the United States. For example, one candidate beats another by a long shot with popular vote but the other candidate wins by electoral votes, the people still have not chosen the representative. The popular vote would bring honesty to the claim that we have a government who is run by the people.

A change to the election of the president by popular vote  might, in fact, cause some differences and tension across the United States but would cause more relief than it would tension. The people are tired of this out dated process and demand power. Many citizens no longer vote because they think their vote does not count, that it is all up to congress and electors in the end. If the way of popular vote were to be set in place, many people would begin to vote again and would be fullfiling their civic duty. More and more people are begining to have negative feelings towards the government and many feel like their opinions do not matter and that nothing is going to change, that it only gets worse. If enough people come togeher, we can change this old and unfair way of voting and everyone's opinions could make a difference in our nation.

""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politican prefrence..."" (p23) The electoral College is not a democratic way of voting because you are not voting for a president, you are voting for elctors who in turrn, will vote for the president they want despite the people's vote. The trust that the electors will vote for the party's nominee is rarely betrayed but is still a possibility. The winner-take-all system is in each state and candidates only focus on the ""swing states"". For example, in the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see candidates. Voters in 25 media markets did not see campaign ads. Popular voting will erase the unfair quality of our presidential elections and bring democratic ways back to the USA.

In conclusion, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (p14) The process in which a president is elected by popular votes is much more feesable and democratic. Many more citizens will be  more likely to vote under this process thus partionally bringing the nation closer to where it should be in the modern term of democracy.                                 ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E48B9182B257,"Dear Senator,

The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please.""

(Paragraph 11)

Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.

Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""

(Paragraph 1)

by the founding fathers. Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media avaliable, like the internet and television. But, it is not working today. The 2000 election serves as an example of a faulty system. ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

(Paragraph 9)

Therefore, this is an obvious majority of citizens who agree with me. The Electoral College is almost universally despised, and not considered the most effective way to elect a President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""

(Paragraph 13)

This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote.

Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! Yes, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign--to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""

(Paragraph 20)

Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election. This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smaller-impact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states.

Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.""

the electors college plays a big role in our state . under the 23 amendment of the constitution , the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and a treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college . this means that because of the electoral college the district of columbia is treated like a state . so electoral college  is the reason why some districts are called a state why take this type of college away if this has such a big role in alot of things to do with the congress . with out the electoral college they wouldnt have presidents or any thing . in every election the electors are always there in every president election every president have their own group of electors behind them . they are joined by a canidates political party .

u may wonder how the electors work because all u do is see them behind the prsident well the process is hard and they want students who wants to be an elector to get ready on what they are about to get in to . it first start off by the u choosing the president when u choose the president u choose the group of electors this means when you choose the president the electors goes with him or her , most states have winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winng pesidental canidate's electors . after the election the govoner pepares a 'certificae of ascertainment'. this means that that it is listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with names of their respective electors . the electors go through a long process . and the college wants the studentsa to know all the things they need to before they become electors.

the electors deserve to have a college someone might want to be an elector and they might think its hard for them it wouldnt be anything with out electors they do more than just stand behind the president they do more they help the president the president we have today wouldnt be able to run for president without a group of electors . and they need a college for someone who wants to be an elector. this college should be honored to be in a program like that these electors are needed in our country with out electors we would have nothing if we didnt have electors the electoral college is widely know as an non democratic method of selecting a president that outa be by declaring the canidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner .

these are all the reasons why we need the electors program . because they play in a big role of our country and dthey also good for our state and .l so we need these progems to show young student that being an elector is not easy itbis very hard and a long process and we need to show students how the experience is and they also need to be knowleged trained to do stuff that will make our country better . because if they mess up  on one little thing its an automatic fire for them . we need these colleges because it plays a big role and it reuires the votes. of the president meaining it helps the president win .                                                   ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

According to an excerpt titled ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College is a process established by the founding fathers in the Constitution ""as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""(Source 1.1) This process consists of a selection of 538 electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress with a majority of 270 needed to be elected president. (Source 1.2-3)

The system of Electoral College is one of much controversy as to what to do with it. Keep it or toss it? 'Tis the question. According to an excerpt of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, a Gallup poll taken in 2000, says that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the one we have now. Apparently, the electoral college has failed us throughout the years because of the unfairness it can sometimes have. One example being presidential candidate, Al Gore, who was cheated out of his postion by the electoral college. The electoral college has caused ""close election(s) in which the popular vote winner can again lose the presidency"". (Source 2.9)

On the contrary, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, an excerpt by Richard A. Posner, has a point when it says that when the people vote for the President they're actually voting for a slate of electors, thus each party votes for the electors who are trusted to vote for the right nominee. It says that very rarely has this trust been betrayed, only happening in 2000, when Gore was hijacked of his position, and centuries earlier in 1888. (Source 3.15-16)

So to keep or toss the Electoral College? 'Tis the question indeed, but the Electoral College has been proven to operate well enough for everyone for the past few centuries since the Constitution was made and the presidents were elected. It was said to fail us in the future but through 44 presidents it has only failed us a few times. Maybe we don't need to see the Electoral College in a black and white, keep it or toss it fashion but think to shape it so the system works better and in favor of the people with fewer kinks.

Please take this into your humbled consideration dear Senator,

C48AEB2F1FC2,"The electoral college is a process established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president & vice president, & the counting of electoral votes by congress. Their are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of impressive democratic origin & history; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. Our country would be much better off if we kept the electoral college, rather than choosing the president just based on the popular vote.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of choosing a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college methodis not democratic in a modern sense, it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate, youre actually voting for a slate of electors.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your states entitled alottment of electors equals the number of its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for each senator. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected & what their responsibilities are.

The electoral college is good because it resores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in constitution. The elctoral college also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. Votes in the toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that they are going to decide the election.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for each party's nominee... however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national populr vote. Yet that has happened in 2000, when gorge had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no intention or hope of carrying their state- democrats in texas, for example, or republicans in california. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign thn they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible american population did vote in 2012's election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an entire election.

I believe this because I think the citizens of the U.S. should be able to vote for their favored presidential candidate directly. In reality, voters are not really voting for their presidential candidate, they are voting for a slate of voters. Below are my main reasons for why I am in favor of demolishing this electoral college

First off, let's get something straight, citizens who regularly vote in the presidential election are not really voting for their desired presidential candidate. All fifty of the U.S. states are given a certain amount of electoral votes. As the electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, it's not fit for the present anymore. According to the third source, the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaing that the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winn er.

There are five reasons why the electoral college has not been demolished yet,

Certainty of outcome

Everyone's President

Swing States

Big States

Avoid Run-Off Elections these are the reasons ehy the electoral college has not been demolished even though it is highly resented in the U.S.A.

In continuation, people who vote should be able to directly vote for who they are in favor of winnning the presidency. That basically means whoever's name was checked off on their voting card should have been their pick to win the election, not for another sllate of voters who do the voting for them, that's not having a voice. The electoral college method of selecting the president may turn of potential voters for a candidatr who has no hope of carrying their state. For example, Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect.

In closing, I urge that the electoral college process should be outruled. Because people who don't support their state, their vote won't matter until this electoral college process is outruled. It is important that all Americans vote count in a election of any kind. They should be able to vote for whoever they want directly, not for electoral, but for the popular vote.

With the electoral college it does not go down that way the people of the state dont get for the president the electors do and it is sectiond by them to. Under the electoral college voters dont vote for the persident they vote for a state of electors.

I think we should change to the most popular vote because the people dint have any say if we keep the electoral college. The people dont even get to vote with the electoral college they just vote for electors who then vote for the president. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the one we have now because they dont even have a say in what they think who should be the president the vote for other people to do that for them. With the electorla college our state only gets a certine number of electros if we change to the popular vote everyone in our state can vote not just a certine number of people. When it comes to vote we vote for members in congress to do the voting for us.

I think we should change to the most popular vote. Under the electoral college voters don't vote for the president but vote for a state for electors. If you were in texes and wanted to vote for john kerry you would be voting for 34 Democratic electors pledge to kerry. On the off chance if kerry won the state wide vote the 34 Democratic electors would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes now that is a little riduculos. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors and chose the wrong one.

There are some up sides to keeping the elctoral college. There is almost allways a certine out come for a winner. With the electoral college everyone votes not just a region. With the electoral college who ever has the most votes in that state wins that state. With the electoral college it helps find a winner in close electoral states. The electoral college avoids problems in which no candidate receives a majority votes cast. I still think we should still change.

I think we should change because not eveyone votes. With the electoral college you don't even get to vote for the president but only vote for a state of electors who then votes for the president. I think we should change because i dont like the idea that we dont even get a say who our president is only electors vote for the president. I think we should change because if some one wins the state wide election they get all the electoral votes for example if there are 34 democratic electors and some one wins the state wide election they get 34 electoral votes.

I would like to favor on changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United Sates because it's a more reliable way of voting who our president should be because everyone in the sate who votes know who they are voting for. We, the voters, are not voting for for our President, but for a slate of electors, people who may or may not vote for who we wanted to win. Its a very tricky method of voting and we believe we should'nt use that method anymore. Also, people who are voting may not have enough knowledge on electors and vote for the wrong electors. I would also like to address the 2000 fiasco, which is the biggest election crisis in the cenurty; the systen allows for much worse. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so that those votes for Kennedy, would not go to him. It is a really unrealiable and unfair way for the citizans to vote for who they would want tto represent this country.

It keeps balance because if the public were to vote on who is the new president of the Untied States some people might fight and argure over who's the new president, why he should be their, and a lot of other reasons. The population might think he will be a great guy and a good president, and that everything will turn out ok. Then when they are elected it turns out he might not be such a great president after all, he's probably going to make all the wrong decides and choices for this nation after a becomes president.

In the Electoral Collage they look at how many votes both of the candidates get, they also look at what the candidates have in mind for our country and all of the other plans they have enstore for it. Of course the public will have to vote on which candidate they want for this nation to serve as our president. After looking at the candidates background, what their going to do, then they will make a discision who becomes president of the Untied States.

They should have their way of deciding who will rule them and the rest of the country.

Of course the electoral college will have its advantages, they chose what happens even though the people are still voting. Maybe they think they know what will benefit the country in each leader. Popular vite would make the people happier and the country as a whole a happier place. If the people knew they had the responsibility of chosing a leader, and their leader is chosen, we wouldnt have to worry about the dispute over who should or should not have been the leader. Candidates will put information out on their plan to a better country, and the people will take into consideration on who they want as their leader. Once they come down to the bestg leader made out by the info given, they will have the right to vote.

301B3A868A3E,"Dear State Senator,

This is a letter to you to discuss an issue that many people may have had problems with in the past. I would like to make a suggestion in trying to change the Electoral College system to popular vote. Changing the system to popular vote may be the best thing for the citizens who want to make their votes count.

I think that it is also not fair that a big state gets more attention than smaller states. According to Richard A. Posner he states that bigger states gets more attetion from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. I think it should all be equal, all states should get as much attetion from presidential candidates no matter what size they are.

According to Bradford Plumer, he states that that sometimes the electors decide no to vote for the party's candidate and vote for who ever they want. That is not fair for the citizens! Voters should be able to have contol on who they vote for because it's their vote, it shouldnt be depended on someone else who might even trick them and end up voting for someone that the people didnt want. Bradford also states that ""500,000 voters would equal 55 representatives who represent 35 million voters, that amouint of voters vote one party for president and another for Congress."" This shows how the House's selection doesn't need to be expected from the will of the people.  If we change the system then people shouldnt have to be depending on who their elector votes for, it would just be their vote that counts.

The winner-take-all system is the worst thing about Electoral College, making it unfair for the voters. Since there are states that candidates know they dont have a chance of winning, they just dont spend time at that state, so they only go to the states they know they will get their votes on. Bradford Plumer also said that during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't get to see the candidates at all, and that 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. which doesnt make fair for those states becasuse they wanted to see who they wanted to cast their vote on. The candidates should have to spend equal time in each state even if they know they aren't going to win it there might be people on those states that might like that candidate.

These reasons should suggest that the Electoral College system should go away, and popular vote would be a better idea. The candidate shouldn't win cause of winner-take-all system, or cause some electors didn't listen to the voters. It should be on the people's hands and what they think of that candidate. The people's votes should what really count.                                                                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D81FB980878F,"After reading this controversial essay on Electoral College and how it affects other and our ""American People"" I feel personally a bit ashamed at our own country that we allow all this nonsense to have happened. In my opinion I would want too ban the choice of Electoral College, because first off we're looking way too deep into our system of voting, is it really necessary too compare our states number of votes with another's just to possibly get noticed? Why dont we take things into our own hands and not count on voting for some stranger to do the work for us.

In one of they many paragraphs I had read, it simply stated ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that out to be (overruled)"" that doesnt sound like everyone here in America is fully williing too agree to all of this, and I wouldn't blame them.  I don't understand why we cant just vote directly for the president ourselves!

If there is already an apparent list of five reasons all about retaining the Electoral College because of its democratic pedigree, just is another reason as too why I'm against this kind of voting system. With having the first reason listed as being ""Certainty of Outcome"" should really make the person reading that question themselves on if they're making a right decision or not.

08F75B0D54E8,"The Electoral College is how America votes for the President and Vise President, which is a process that the U.S. shouldn't have. Intially, if people are voting for a President, they know what they want and have done their research. Along with that, it gives the Electorial College more rights than the actually people voting for the President and Vise President. Lastly, it's just down right unfair to the voters. The U.S. wants every person to have equal chance at the election for a president and if about 500 people are voting compared to the millions, it's just unfair to the citizens. In the world now, this process is taking away the freedom of decision or making it seem useless to the people. The Electorial College shouldn't be a process we use for voting.

Most people voting, actually care who is running the country and they took the effort to make sure they got the vote in. The votes from the actually people should count because, evidentally, they know what they want. Most people do not go to a place if they do not care for the purpose, but if citizens are voting for their president, it should count, not having other elected officials vote. The elected officials voting, are in the government and that creates a biased vote which is uncalled for. The votes need to be from the people because they see the actual truths of what is happning to the economy, salary, taxes, the process of the government, and much more. It is obvious that having the people vote is a more efficient choice than pre-elected officials.

Secondly, the Electorial college takes away the rights to choose what president they want. Yes, they get to vote for which electoral college member they want but, it doesn't actually add up to the number the citizens actually participate in. As stated in the Constitution, citizens of America have freedom, and they should have the freedom of choosing the Preseident and Vice President they want without out any ifs,ands, or buts. America has the freedom to choose and the Electorial College shuts it all down, which is disrespect to citizens and to the country.

Lastly, it is such an unfair process. As said previously, it geneuinly takes our freedom of choice away. People need to be heard and listened for what they actually want but the government lives their own way and doesn't take into count what the people, that make the country up, want. ""Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""(The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the laid-back defenses of the syster are wrong by Bradford Plumer). This here proves that the candidates are only in for the game and not the real true choice in who will be a perfect official that runs the country all together. Clearly, the process all together is a complete unfair, brutial game to the people.

In Retrospect, having the Electorial College is a disaster and having it as a process makes we use every four years is unbelieveable. It treats the Americans like there freedom is worthless and makes the voting process unfair. If the people take the time to actually stand in line to vote, they hould earn the right of having their vote count in full picture. This process shouldn't continue on, for it is 500 or so people voting for the President and Vise President for over millions. That itself, is outragious and shouldn't be apart of the American voting process anymore.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
BE8F32C4B3BA,"Dear state senator,

In my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system. I think we should keep the way we elect our presidents because it's a non-democrac way. It's also easy and fast by killing two birds with one stone. Our founding fathers compromised the Electoral system and since we can't get rid of our admendments and change the Constitution I don't tink we should get rid of the Electoral College system. It may be old, but new things aren't always the best things. I think if the Goverment wanted to change it they should try it on a state first before they roll it to the rest of the nation, and we all know the goverment isn't that smart and won't do it because we are their test animals.

Another reason to keep the Elctoral system is because it's easy and effciant. If we just have the elction just be based off votes and not popular party it would be messy. The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.  Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones.

270 votes are not a lot of votes to win an elction with, but every vote counts. Some people may not vote because there are only two parties that most of the nation only cares about the Republicans and the Democrats. Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity. But everyone should vote to express there politcal power. That's why we should keep it because if we change it we're changing our minds in the way vote.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think that you should change election to popular voting for the president of the United States because the Electoral College is unfair. Everyone should have a say in who our next president will be. That is a very important thing because we are choosing a ruler of our country and somone who will take care of us. Allowing only a few people to vote in each state does'nt make any sense because people are only choosing from their opinion and there is lots of other in that state that probably don't agree with what they chhose. I think that everyone should be allowed to vote for who they want for president because it is fair. It is fair because everyone is voting based on their own opinions of a person. When the electoral College votes, its kind of like favoritism and the voting ends up being not even and not justified.

In the artical it says, ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" To me, that is wrong because again, it is showing favoitism towards a small group of people. No one else gets anything, just those few people. Another line from the passage says, ""Perhpas most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.""

The way I believe our new President should be selected is by a majority rule, which ever Canidate has the most votes should win not based off people who vote for our state we live in. Even though the majority of the time the representative from his or her state votes depending on the popular vote from there state, but the reason im saying this is that he or she has the power to pick whatever he or she wants.

Some presidents have won popular vote but haven't won the election because of the electoral college. Some electors have even refused to vote for the candidate that they were elected to vote for.

I think it would be best to keep the Electoral College process instead of changing it to popular demand. The reason why I think that is because I would rather have political experts who study the two candidates based on the speeches they give prior to election day make the decision on who should be our president rather than random voters across the United States. I personally think that if we keep the whole Electoral College process our country will improve a lot. On the other hand, if we were to use the popular demand process than voters could discriminate against one candidate and choose the other one. On top of that when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of candidates. So even if one candidate gets picked over the other, their is still a lot of voting left to be done. I think the Electoral College process would be better for the United States as a whole. I also think if we were to use the Electoral College process it would decrease a lot of arguments and controversy across the United States. If we were to use the popular demand process their could easily end up being a tie, where as if we were to use the Electoral College process they judges could come to an agreement as to who won the election entirely. Also, if we were to use the Electoral College process their would be no such thing as a run-off election anymore. Usually when you use the popular demand process one state might get more attention then another state, where as Electoral College process will treat each and every state equally. When using the Electoral College process it would be easier to count up the votes because you only have so many voters, where as with the popular demand process there would have to be over 2 million votes counted up. There are many other reasons why the Electoral College should be used over the popular demand process. So it shouldnt be hard for you to decide on what process should be used during the Presidential elections. That is why I think the Electoral College process should be used.

While it is unfair, the Electoral College should still be used. There are some problems with the way it works, but it would still be easier than having presidential elections by popular vote.

One of the reasons why the Electoral College should still be used is the certainty of the outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes - 538 - is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Secondly, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.

At the most basic level, however, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Aside from it being a little unfair, the Electoral College does its best to elect a President, which is why it should still be kept.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

If there was no Electoral College all these little states like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states like California. Richard A. Posner states ""other things being equal, a large state get more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does"" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or large states. The one big problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost all of the U.S. not voting for their president but instead for the people who vote for them.

Even though that is a pretty big problem, it does help keeps things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region like the South aren't praised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were up to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president""(Posner,19). The same paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to elect a president.

Within the Electoral College are people who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as president. If it were up to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed up. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearences but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more popular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keep the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the people when voting for president. They try tp evenly distribute the votes with each state,they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keep things fair for everyone so that we can all be happy.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
649B2A197C4A,"Dear Senator,

If you were to question U.S. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? Most of them don't even know its a process established in the Constitution in which electors ""vote for president and vice president,"" and then are counted by the Congress (Source 1, paragraph 1). They don't realize that their votes can be over-riden by these votes. And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntle about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information.

Most voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, ""... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,"" (paragraph 9). Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. As active voters in todays society, we call for a fair system. We want, no, we need, to be treated fairly and not over-riden.

We need a system us as people can control ourselves. As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, ""Who picks the electors in the first place?"" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state governement in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidental candidates themselves can pick them (paaragraph 10)! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,"" (paragraph 15). It's outragous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more.

As you probably already know, each state's ""...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation..."" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. ""In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all..."" and that campaign was refered to as a ""fiasco"" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).  This leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote. In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states (or larger ones) ""... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates),"" (paragraph 20).

Selection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, ""... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,"" (paragraph 12). This shows the citizens aren't really being represented properly.

Altough many downfalls, ""The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose"" and ""avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,""(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22). Yet still there can be holes poked in that, and all though unlikely, theres an even amount of votes so the vote could be split 50/50. Just imagine the chaos we could be thrown into.

Therefor, as a concerned citizen speaking as the voice of others, we demand a better system, for a simplerly system, for an equal system, for a system we can control ourselves. We demand for a direct system! So I ask, please, for you to speak to your friends, and speak out for your people, and put an end to the Electorial Colleges.

Sincerly,

A concerned citizen.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
AA816601F313,"Dear State Senator, we should not keep the Electoral College. I'm in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electoral college is unfair. It's outdated and irrational. Many people prefer election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote diectly towards the president. They shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president.

One of my reasons is because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect for the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on the state, the electors are picked by state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, and sometimes the presedential candidates themselves. The electoral college isn't the best way to handle elections because it is the electors who elect the president, not the people, which to me sounds unfair. Voters can't always control who their electors will vote for and voters do get confused sometimes about the electors. So if you really agreed on one president, chances are that might not be the president who's gonna be elected because the electors can choose the other person running for president instead.

The electoral colllege is unfair. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. Richard Nixo, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing the electoral act. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, over sixty percent of voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Voters don't want the popular vote winner to lose the presidency but because of the electoral college it can happen. When you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

Lets say that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors. Those electors can always defy the will of the people. Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they pleased. Why on earth would they do such a thing. They should care about what voters believe in. In 1960, people who favored seperation based on race in the Louisiana legislature nearly actually succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors so that they would oppose John F. Kennedy. This means the popular votes would not have actually gone to Kennedy. That is not fair. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. They focus only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

State Senator, I'm in favor of changing to election by popular votes because it's fair. The electoral college should stay in the past and should'nt be used anymore. The best way is for the election by popular votes. Voters should be satisfied with their vote directly towards the president. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and decided to vote for whoever they wanted. Selfish much? People shouldn't have to be upset if they choose candidates and those candidates choose someone else as president. These electors should consider what the people want. I believe Elections by popular votes for president of the united states is the best option.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

37DFBAA507EE,"The problem with the electoral college is that the people really arent controlling who they vote for. Personally i am in favor of changin the electoral college to popular vote. The representatives of the electoral college can basically vote for who ever they want to vote for. The people only influence the electoral college. The people should have the right to vote for the candidate that they want not the one that some representative in the electoral college chooses. These are just some reasons why i think the presidential should be replaced by popular vote.

To begin with, the representatives of the electoral college can basically vote for who ever they want to vote for. When a voter places there vote they arent voting for the actual president they are simply voting for the reps of the electoral college. ""The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" What this means is that basically the election is based on what they decide not on what the people say.

Furthermore, the only thing the people do by voting is that they influence the electoral college's decision. The people dont really get to choose who they believe should be in office. All the electoral college does is get in the way of whom the people choose to be president. The electoral college should be removed and replaced with popular vote. This should take place as soon as possible.

Lastly, the people should have the right to vote for whom they believe should take office; not for some representative that is gonna choose who ever they want. For example, lets say that one votes for obama, they arent really voting for obama they are voting for someone who could pick obama, But the person that they vote for to pick obama could change there mind and vote for the other candidate. So really the peoples vote doesnt even matter. All it does is influence the vote of some representative from the electoral college. I believe that this should be changed to popular vote. In which the people vote for the candidate they want to be president and then all the votes are counted up and compared. Thats the way the presidential should be done. This is the best way for the peoples voice to be recognized and it will make a difference.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Senator of the United States, I ask that you put a stop to the electoral college.

First of all, I believe that The United States is a corrupted democracy. The electoral college is a unbeneficial way of voting because they may be bias towards the people, for example, one might know what another so it can be considered as favoritism. In a sense this voting system can be manipulated in ones favor. How the voting system works is considered wrong to many Americans.

Workers in politics such as Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter also do not believe in the electoral college and they even wanted to get rid of them! Most people want to get rid of the electoral college because of the ""winner take all' system. If it wasnt for the winner take all system George W.

Many politicians believe ingetting rid of the electoral college such as Bob Dole when he said ""abolish the electoral college!""

A7A467BDEE14,"America: land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country.

Proponents of the Electoral College would gasp in horror at this suggestion, arguing that their systematic method is virtually foolproof. Nevertheless, with a voting method as complicated as the Electoral College, the room for error is far too great. Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democtratic electors  chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occured in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exeption. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leade, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this resposibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.

Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. Just consider the fact that by completely ignoring all of the other states, campaigners are ignoring millions of individuals who deserve to have a say in who will be in charge. Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the 'thoughtful' voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves.

The problems with the Electoral College only go on. If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. Also, due to the fact that the Electoral College mainly operates with the winner-take-all rule, it is easy for individuals in Democratic or Republican states to feel as if their vote doesn't matter.

It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.

For all of these reasons, I urge you to change the system to election by popular vote. It is without a doubt the only way this country can continue to be the great nation that it is for centuries to come.            ",6,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
013A7EFCDA35,"Dear state Senator,

I am writing to you today to tell you the Electoral College is not fair, takes power from the people, and is very unclear in many areas. There have been many instances that prove this point and we need to change before the power of presidency goes to someone who doesnt deserve it.

In the 2000 presedential election Al Gore lost. How is this possible if he won the popular vote which is the real voice of Americans? Well the electoral college decided otherwise. Someone who was supposed to be representing your vote at the meeting of the electors decided he didnt believe in the thousands of votes people picked and voted for whoever he felt was right. This is unfair to the people, and the presedential candidates.

How can someone justify our government as a democracy, and then turn around and say were putting the powere of voters in the hands of members of Congress and The House of Representatives who may not believe in what the states popular vote is and pick who ever they want? They can't. This process takes away peoples votes and gives them no say in the government. If we don't change then were taking away peoples rights.

As if that was'nt enough to get rid of the Electoral College theirs more. What if theres a tie in the Electoral College? I mean it's very possible 135 members vote one way and the other 135 the other. Well in this situation the house of representatives would decide. This means the same state that has 100's of millions of voters would have as much say as a state with thousands of voters. Where does the millions of votes from the other state go? Down the drain. This is why the unjust electoral college system must be stopped.

Wether your a voter who got cheated by the electoral college or Al Gore who got the presidency taken from him you should realize the electoral college is unfair, unjust, and must be stopped so people can have there vote back.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Dear state sentor,

Should the president use popular vote to get elected or use Electoral College? That's a tough decision. Honestly, I believe that the government should use popular votes instead of the states votes because not everyone in the one state that the president is trying to win over will vote for him. Also, I think Electoral College is a bad idea because it's too much of a big process.

Electoral College votes are way more complicated then they should be. That's why I believe you should get votes based on every individual instead. For example, if you're trying to win over California but not everyone in that state wants you to rule them, then why make them angry? Everyone has their own opinion I believe. Everyone has their own voice. The people like to be heard.

I also believe that you should just get elected based on popular votes because then everyone will be more interested in voting for you. If more peoples opinions are a matter to you then you're most likely to win. I say this because people who want to rule us, such as yourself, are people who should care. People who like their opinion being heard are people who should be important to a ruler.

So after reading my letter i assume that it had some meaning. I hope you changed your mind about how you want to be elected. Electoral college is a too confusing process and it cannot always be used.

F5419CDEF2D6,"Dear State Senator,

I agrue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, for this reason it wouldhave to be the fact that it is a much easier method electing presidental canditates. At times I know it can be unfair to most of the voters around the nation but this way is more easier than it might already seem. Instead of the people voting for which they think is the new president, it would be more likely the electors who elect the president for the state. These slate of electors are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. For some states it wouldn't be just random it be either democratic, or republicians. When having the electors it wouldbe possible to be the winner of the electoral vote but not the national popular vote.

For the president's chance of winning having an Electoral College will exceed his share of popular vote. An example would be the election backin 2012, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared 6to what Romeny had because most of the states awarded the eletoral votes on the winner-take-all basis, can get a chance of having victory in winning the electoral vote. But there would be a possible chance of having a tie against the states.

Another reason for this debate would have to be the reason that the candidates themseveles have to get the regional appeal from the states. For Romeny that gave him an opporunity but had little to offer. He no electoral votes in the states that he knowshe will win. For this unsuccessful result, Romeny only had regional appeal there for he was less likely to successed in the southern region. For other states that felt as if their votes didn't count, so there for assumed that Romeny had little interest, leading to the thought of an unlawful candidate. Swing states on the other hand have a chance of making it. The reason for that being is voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election. On avergae they are are thought of as the most thoughtful voters (the result is that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates.

Electoral Colleges balance the weight in political balance that larger states lose virtue of the Senate. For Obama he won that vote based on the amount of electoral votes he recieved from Florida was 29. Also 3 from the state of Wyoming. In other reasons, larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states do.

Based on the information I have provided you in this statement, I will concluded that sometimes this method can be a little complicated to most voters in the U.S. For the reason is that most of the smaller states remain unseen by the candidates of the elections but sometimesend up winning thepopluar vote for the candidate they chose. In the beginning in starting the Electoral College was held by our founding fathers of this great nation. There for this methodshouldremain as it should. Thank you for your consideration.

The Electorial college is made up of 538 electors, a majority of the 270 electorial votes is required to be elected to be President. Each state is allowes allotment of electors. One for each member in the house of representatives, with two each for Senators. Each canidata running for President is allowed their own group of electors, which are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. With that being said, state laws vary on how the electors are picked and what each of their responsibilitys are. Each Presidential election is held every four years, on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

What is so wrong with the electorial college that 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct election? Well, under the electorial college system voters do not vote for the president, but vote instead for a slate of electors. Say you wanted to vote for a president who is Demographic, you would then vote for a slate of 34 demographic electors that pledged to that president. The electors are not allowed to be someone who is holding public office. With this being said, the voters cannot always control who their electors vote for.

In the ELectorial Colleges' deffence, its avoids the problem of elections where neither of the candidate's recieve a majority of the vote. It is very possible that the winner of the electorial vote may not wint the national popular vote, even though it happens very rarely it happened in 2000. Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but still fewer electorial votes, that was the first time since 1888. n

The thought of having to vote for the President of the United States, you actually get to pick who you want it to be. That would mean not only changing the constitution and having to come up with more rules and responsibilities, but allowing one to vote directly for who they want to become President. Wouldn't that be easier? Instead of having to come up with a electorial college and dealing with all of the risks, allowing citizens to pick for themselfs. I agree with the though of abolishing the electorial college, and so do 60 perecnt of voters. When a citizen votes on the electorial college itself, they have the chance of the college not pivking the President they would like to vote for.

With all of that being said, and the facts given right to you, it up to you to decide what you think is better for the United States. Either way, we still have to vote on a President every four years... with or without a Electorial College.                                                       ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
71A39287ACEF,"Dear State Senator,

In my opinnion the way voting is staged should be change to popular voting opposed to Electoral Voting. Electoral College is basically the congress voting rather than citizens. Do we get to vote? Yes, but the the Electoral College gets to decide where it's going. That how citizens should feel, make a vote and the candidate they want to elect is the place it's going to arrive to.

Citizens should have the power they think they have, all the protest and arguing about rights and many others that we have crossed over the years, does that not mean anything anymore? We live in a world of democracy, whoever has the most should be the President of our United States. Our duties as citizens are to vote, yes. Well, let us do our jobs the proper way. The government makes it look as to we have much power as citizens, but do we really?

They say that the Electoral College can do us wonders, by picking our president and knowing who the right one is for our country. Only we know us the citizens thats our right and now the are taking that right away from us little by little. Let me tell you why the Electoral College is dreadful, when we vote for which candidate we want to become our president it goes to a certain group of eletors and they use all the votes from our state to push up the candidate they want to become our presidant. Let's not forget about the

Disaster Factor . America almost hit the worse crisis in that known century, all becasuse of the wrong selection of an elector.

On the other hand another thing to worry about would a tie on the electoral vote. Then the votes are to be handled down to the House of Representatives, and if the were having a tie on a vice-president vote it would be the senator. Why don't you see the candidants going down to the state to persuade you to vote for them? All because of the chance they know that they may not have. Only beacuse the desision doesn't really relay on us. All of our voting has given us our duty and right, but do we truely do what we want to do?

Citizens and Candidates don't get the full voting experience as we used to. Votes are in the hands of the electors and not the citizens. Voting is what make makes America, America! Do you really want to jeopardize America and it's voting system? Where do any of us stand?                      ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

6794A463D2C5,"Dear Senator,

People have different opinions on the Electoral College. Some feel that it should be changed, and the president should be elected by popular vote. To explain what the Electoral College is, the Office of the Federal Register writes

What is the Electoral College?.

Bradford Plumer writes

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, to explain the problems with the Electoral College, and lastly, Richard A. Posner writes

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President to explain why we should keep the Electoral College. It has been made clear that we should not change the Electoral College.

It is true that the Electoral College may be confusing (Plumer), but it has worked for all these years, thus we should just leave it the way it is.

To start, The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress, and it also considers the popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the Federal Register). The founding fathers wanted us to use this system. They knew it would succeed.

Next, Plumer writes, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair..."" This is not true because the number of electorals each state gets is always decided by the number of members that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for the senators (Office of the Federal Register).

Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome. Plumer goes against that and writes, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This cannot happen.  Posner also writes that ""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" The north, for example, does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president (Posner). The president is everyone's president.

Also, The Electoral College considers swing states and big states. Plumer writes ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"". This is not true because of the idea of swing states and big states.  Swing States, also known as toss-up states, are the states that pretty much decide the election. They could go either way (Posner). ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senete decreed in the Constitution. "" This means that the larger the state (in population, not size), the more their overall vote weighs.

Lastly, by using the Electoral College, we are avoiding Run-Off Elections. A run off election is when no candidate recieves a majority (Posner).

In conclusion, you and I both know the Electoral College has some flaws, but overall, it makes sense to keep it the way it is.

Yours truly,

Emily.                                                                                                                         ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
4E9C1118F452,"I don't believe that we should keep the Electoral College. Popular vote seems more like the way to vote for a president. Considering there are only 538 electors in the Electoral College, and only 270 votes are required it doesn't seem right that the people don't get to voice their opinion. Also considering the fact that the Electoral College may not be an efficient means of voting because of what happened in the 2000 election. Bradford Plumer states that it was the biggest election crisis in a century. We wouldn't want something like that to happen again.

If we use the popular vote instead there may be less chaos and the system would be more efficient. In the Elecoral College one person could say what is going to happen over thousands of people who may agree or disagree. Which to me doesn't seem like the right choice. The people of the United Sates should have the choice of who should be our next president. We as U.S. citizens have the freedom of speech and the right to vote. The Electoral College is simply unfair to voters,as well as irrational, as Bradford Plumer has stated. But Richard Posner does state that the Electoral College gives political balance to bigger states when it comes to the elections. Though it may benefit in some way it still has its flaws and shouldn't be used in something as big as an election for the president of the United States.             ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
2C78AF6ADD75,"Dear Senator,

I feel like we should keep the Electoral College because, ""A disput over the outcome of a electoral college vote is possible but, it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"". This means that that people would argue over the electoral college vote and who they voted for but but people most likely would not argue over the popular vote. They have done this before in 2012's election prosses with Obama and Romney. The second reason is that everyone will have to put ads up because not just one region of votes will make them president they are going to need to advertise everywhere.

The third reason is that ""the winner-take-all method of awarding Electoral votes induces the canidates"". This means to me that the method helps the canidates so they can win easily. The fourth and final reason is that the big staes get more votes because they have more people in there country so the automatically get more attention from the president. It is also easier for them to get what they want meaning they can reallly like choose any president they want and its a high percenatge that they will get that president.

Those are only some of the reasons that i think we should keep the Electoral College. To me I feel it would be easier to just do this other than count all the votes frome every single voter. Besides what other brillant plan can you come up with that is easier than this?         ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The founding fathers established it in the constitution as comprimise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The thing is the president shouldnt be picked on his personality or his or hers past, they should be judged by the changes they can make and how they can make it better for the people on the out side world. they shouldnt be voted by the fancy no good stuck ups in the office 24/7 bc half the time they dont know good, i mean look at the president we have now.

The process consists of the section of the electors, which they vote president or vice president. under the Electoral collage system voters vote not for president but for a state of elections. They shouldnt have to vote like that , why have the office men and women vote president? When u could have the citizens of state do it. The office men and women dont know what the citizens want or need. There just there to get money and sit on there butts 24/7 and do nothing but make poor decisions as a reference to our president.

The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Then in that case the election would be thrown to The House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president. There shouldnt be a tie and having to be thrown in to The House of Represntatives.

63765DD9525D,"The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years. It allows for silly tricks to be played - you can win the presidency with a mere fourty percent of the country in support of you. You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count. The system even allows for massive corruption to go unpunished, which is one of the biggest offenses in our country.

The electoral college's biggest flaw may perhaps be its ability to elect a president that doesn't even appeal to half of the country. According to source two, Al Gore ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Al Gore had a signifigant victory in popular vote for the nation, yet still was denied presidency due to the electoral college's vote assignment system. If we did away with the electoral college, each and every person would have an equal say, and would be equally important to the candidates.  Even source three agrees that the trust in our electors is occasionally betrayed, albiet rarely.

Currently, the candidates can completely ignore portions of our country. Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south - so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital.

The electoral college system also allows for an astonishing amount of corruption with no punishment. If a state manages to vote one hundred percent Democrat, rogue electors can still cast their vote for the Republican candidate - and this isn't against the rules. We're essentially putting the next four years of our country into the hands of 538 electors, and holding them to the lowest possible degree of accountability. Again, source three clearly states ""and that trust is rarely betrayed."" While it's rare, it's still more than possible, and can be quite disasterous.

Some may argue that the electoral college system puts into place a system of certainty and safety, for both the candidates and the people. This, however, is quite far from the truth. According to source three, ""the residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised."" While this source claims that ignoring biased parts of the population, this is quite far from the truth. People are being entirely ignored by the powerful politicians that are supposed to represent them. That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only one-half of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't. Half of our country isn't bothering to vote in the elections because the electoral college system completely negates their vote.

Our country prides itself on being ""the land of the free, and the home of the brave,"" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.

5E28624299A0,"""The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprimise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualififed citizens."" (Paragraph 1)  The electoral college is made of 538 people called electors, these people are there to take in consideration what the people voted and then they them selves vote physically for the President of the United States.  The electoral coolege is good beacuse there is not as much controversey and if its been fine for this long it sould not be changed now.

Controversey, a big word with lots of meaning, but what does it really mean in this context.  It is when two or more things are being argued about, in this case two politacal veiws.  Whether or not we should keep the electoral college or get rid of it and go back to popular vote for electing the President of the United States.  Having a little bit of controversey is good but the reason why the founding fathers made this into the constitution is to stop the out rageuos argueing that was going on when electing the First president.  It states in paragraph 3 ,""The electoral college consists of 538 electors.  A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.""  This shows that they didnt just make it to please one side of the arguement, this pleased both side because it was very fare and didnt favor one side to the other.  By doing this it nearly ended all of the argueing and controversey, which that is what they wanted to acomplish.

Futhermore, the electoral college is good because why would you change something that has been working perfectly and helped the voting process out tremdously over hundreds of years.  They have had voting for the President down to a science now, for example,""The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november."" (paragraph 6)  Everyone in the U.S. knows this date, it is imprinted in our brain when that day is and we need to clear our calenders and turn on the grill because that is a very specail day of change for our beautiful country.

Many people say there are problems with the electoral college, then again there are problems with everything in this crazy world we live in.  ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" (paragraph 11)  Yes there was a crisis but to say that the electoral college is corupt and bad just cause of that fiasco is to far.  America is too strong to break down from just that and there are to many belivers in the electoral college to have it just fall to peices from that one problem.  It also shows the resliency of the electoral college, and not just that but also showing changes so that those crisises wont ever happen again. ""Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors...""  That is living proof that there are changes and fixes being made to further the effiency of the Electoral College.

All in all the electoral college has proven itself to be more then just helpful but it has changed America itself.  It was made to settle a comprimise made but it has settled more arguements then anyone can count.  Its proven to the world it is here to stay and is not leaving anytime soon.                                                       ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
74CA2200A7FB,"Dear Rick Scott,

Controversial. This is the word that can describe the Electoral College in recent elections. The Electoral College is composed of 538 votes, a presidential candidate must acquire 270 to win the election. States with large populations get more electoral votes so say, Rhode Island. California gets 55 votes while the puny Rhode Island gets a whopping 3 votes. The Electoral College has been debated since the 2000 election, where Al Gore lost even though he got more popularity votes. Many folks believe the Electoral College should be abolished. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept in the presidential elections, because it shows a clear winner, it ensures it is, ""Everyone's President"", educated voters count in the swing states and it avoids Run-Off Elections.

Without the Electoral College, some elections may be hard to decide a true winner. No matter the situation, the Electoral College will determine a winner, if the popular vote and electoral vote become tied, (which is highly unlikely,) the vote will be taken to the senate. Each senator counts as one vote, so no longer do bi states matter. Also, the Electoral College ensures the presidential candidates have trans-regional appeal. It makes the votes count, the president chose is surely, ""Everyone's President,"" rather than a favorite in just northeastern states. Furthermore, swing states are tremendously important to the outcome of the election. States such as Florida, New York, Texas and California have dozens of votes combined, winning all four of those states pretty much means presidency. The swing states not only have more electoral votes because of population, but because of their voters. On average, there are more educated voters in the swing states, they actually stay up to date, watch the news and know the means of each candidate. The Electoral College also avoids the disaster of which no cadidate receives a majority of the votes cast. A good example of this is when Clinton had only 43% of the popular votes won, yet he got a whopping 370 electoral votes, which made him president. The pressure of having a run-off election is nearly vanished by the Electoral College. Although others say that the Electoral College should be abolished, because in that system, voters vote a slate of electors, not the president. Well tough , the Electoral College ensures a winner, and that is all that matters.

The Electoral College should, for sure, be kept in the Presidential Election system. It consists of 538 total votes, and 270 votes have to go to a candidate to pick a winner. Although the votes may tie up, which is nearly impossible, the Electoral College ensures another method to decide the presidency. The Electoral College produces a sure winner, ""Everyone's President,"" is elected, educated voters are in the swing states and it avoids the disaster of a Run-Off Election.

With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics. Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.

The worst thing about the Electoral College is that it is just outright puzzling. Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. This all leads to the next disadavntage of the Electoral College, unfairness.

As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, ""... Al Gore ---thanks to the quirks of the electoral college---won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.

To sum it up, the Electoral College should be eliminated from the presidental voting process. People should just directly vote for who they want as president and see where it goes from there.                   ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College is a process which consists of the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, meetings of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the selection of electors. It consists of a total of five hundred and eight electors and a majority of two hundred and seventy votes are required for presidency. Electors are choosen by the candidates political party. When voting for presidential elections, you are also voting for your candidates electors too.

When the presidential elections are complete the govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all the candidates who ran for President and the names of all the electors and it also tells who won the presidency and the electors that will represent your state. The state conventions, state partys central comitee, and the presidential candidates, all pick the electors.

Even though the electoral college is such and organized process of completing task; it is a disaster factor, it is unfair against voters. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to be choosen. It can be argued that the electoral college methods of choosing electors is bad. Obama is the president of the United States.

The Electoral College balances out the amount of popular votes. If both candidates are tied, we turn to the state electors. The candidate that has the biggest amount of electoral votes wins. One candidate can have more popular votes and very few electoral votes. The popular votes are just for the state electors to decide which they are going to pick.

I think that the presidential election should be settled by popular vote.  We people are being run as a country by the president, and we should be able to have more of an impact choosing who our president will be.

The president currently gets chosen in the Electoral College, a process in which the electors vote for President and Vice President after they are selected.  This process flows very well and the president is chosen easily, so its good.  The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors.  The majority being 270 electoral votes and the first president to get to this number in the race wins.  We the people are separated into states and the states get however many electoral votes based on population.  So the bigger states get more say on who's President, but I mean that makes sence because more citizens live there.  There are also many flaws with this process though, and thats why I think it should be settled by popular vote.

You may think that the people are mainly voting for the President in the Electoral Collage process, but we're not.  The people just vote for electors who in turn elect the President.  Some of the slates of electors may even vote for who they want to and forget about what the majority of the state wants.  At the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system in each state.  This means that if say Florida has twenty-nine electoral votes, then all twenty-nine go to the candidate who wins that state.  ""So normaly candidates don't spend time in states they know they have know chance of winning, focusing only on the ""swing states"" and the larger populated states.""  ""Swing states"" are states that pay close attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing cadnidates.  This means that the states may pick the republican or democrat.  Some states pick the same way every election.  During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina.  I mean what kind of madness is that, how are they supposed to know who to choose.  Thats not fair and it shouldn't be settled that way.  This all just proves that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

Therefore the Electoral Collage shouldn't be the way to elect the President and Vice-President and should be either altered or in my opinion scratched.  So then they should be elected by popular vote, so we have more control on who runs the country.

F8A06DB4A5CE,"The electoral college system is better than the popular vote system because every citizen should have a say in who is running the country they are living in. Also, if not everyone has a say in who their president is there would probably be claims of discrimination towards the government for not letting those people vote. There would,as well, not be a standard that could be set that everyone agrees on because the people excluded would not accept it. Popular vote hasnt worked in the past and it wont work now either.

If we chose the popular vote system it would never work out because there would always be people,mostly the ones excluded from voting, that would disagree with the system in general and the standard set on who can or can't vote. For example,in colonial times only white men who owned land could vote and I am sure that the african americans and the women and even the white men who didn't own land were not too happy with that standard. Of course if we had the popular vote system today,the standard would definitely have to be changed but the people who are excluded wouldn't like the system at all.

In the electoral college system everyone who would like to gets a say in who is running their country and pretty much nobody has a problem with it. It is also much easier to count the vote's of 586 votes from the electoral college than like half a billion from cictizens in america. Another two reasons that the electoral colege system is better than the popular vote system.

In the colonial times there were slaves and only 1 out of every 4 votes from slaves counted and that was very discriminative but it was how it was back then but think,if we adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white and black people could vote or only white men. There would be udder chaos in America and there would be wrongful deaths and crimes. I would get mad too if i was put in a spot where i was not allowed to vote but some people would take it to the extreme and it probably wouldn't stop until the standard was amended.

In conclusion, the popular vote system is all around a bad idea and it would cause nothing but bad times. Keep the voting system the same because everyone seem's to like it so dont fix it if it's not broken. That is why we should not change or fix the voting system in America.

592F8F39E3EA,"Voting has always been something special for almost everyone. From African Americans fighting in the Civil War for the right to vote and women in the nineteenth-century also fighting for voting rights, Voting had always been a controversial topic. This privilege has changed many times in the beginning of the United States and since its birth, the primary way to vote for the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral college is a process of electors in it voting for the president. It is almost always an one-sided battle for whoever that agrees or disagrees with the Electoral Colloge. For someone that is usually neutral, i am in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the United States choose their president.

To begin with, even though the Electoral College is critisized of it not being democratic, it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed. The trust between the people and their electors is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College will  almost always gurantee an outcome while if it was another way, more ties and balancing will happen. from the article itself, it stated ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""- Richard A. Posner. The Electoral College will always let the people's voices be heard even if it was in a indirect way.

Furthermore, The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States ave enough electoral votes for a president to get elected. Regional favorites, such as Romney in the south, will have plenty of problems if he is just a regional favorite instead of all over the country. This system will caused presidents to be more diversed in the country to be able to spread hierachical diffusion of the idea of geting themselves to be elected. From source number three, it also states that ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""- Richard A. Posner. The people will get to experience the president themselves instead of jst voting for the one they are biased upon.

Lastly, The Electoral College method of selecting the president avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. There is a pressure in which if no candidates win a majority of the vote,there will be a run-off election. that would greatly complicate the presidential election process by wasting more time and money. however, that process is reduced by the Electoral College method, which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College System can also be argued against that it can turn off potential voters for a candidate who had no hope of carrying thier state. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, there will be less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""- Richard A. Posner is one of the quotes in source number three. But of course, no single vote can change the outcome of a presidential election since voters in presidential elections are mpstly people who want to express an opinion than thinking that a single vote will change a election.

In conclusion, our current way of the Electoral College system is the best way to vote for presidential elections. Even though people could argue that it is un-democratic, the way they elect the electors and having the president promote themselves in a certain way does make the system every one bit of it democratic. To remind you senator, the Electoral Collage system should stay because it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed, requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. That is why i truly believe that the Electoral Collage is here to stay.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
BF295AF91B15,"Dear State Senator,

I personally think that we should not have the Electoral College , because the citizens should be allowe to pick our president and vice prsident. It should be up to the people not the congress. According to paragraph three of source one , the Electoral College consist of five hundred and thirty-eight electors . A canidate has to earn two hundred and seventy of those votes . To me that is not right . Why spend time bringing these people in to vote when you have a whole state full of people who wants to have a voice in the matter.

Also the congress does not know what the people want . So if you pick a canidate and he is not what the people what he may be planning to blow up the world . The citizens of the United States know what they wan in a leader and they know what they look forward to in the future . By letting congress select our president your not letting us speak for our self and that is wrong .According to paragraph fifteen of source three ,Electoral College  is widely regarded as an Anachronism and needs to bee overruled which i strongly agree with . Also in paragraph sixteen of source three, it states that citizens choose their representative and they trust them to pick the right person but that trust is often betrayed , So why would you keep having this election ? Soon enough people are going to stop caring .

According to paragraph eleven of source two , The electoral college is a waist of time and it is not needed because people are starting not to care and are not even choosing their own canidate . They are not liking who their state chose and they dont care because state legistlatures are responsible for picking electors anyway . Some states choose two slates and send them to congress ,Like Hawaii did in 1960,Things like this is why we dont need electoral colleges . What if it happens again ? or What if there is a tie ?

In an electoral college every state could only cast one vote . So they have one represntative for lets say five hundred thousand voters .That doesnt make any sence at all . How come everyone doesnt vote for who thy want by themselves ? Maybe someone whats a president frome another state instead of their own .According to paragraph fourteen , It states that the electoral college is unfair , outdated and irrational and i agree one hundred percent . As Bob Dole Says Abolish the Electoral College .

In closing i hope you will view in my favor and in everyone elses who says this type of system is old , unfair and it needs to be ruled out . I thank you for reading my letter and i hope you enjoyed hearing about what i think . It was a pleasure writing to you and i really hope you take my opinion into consideration .

9FA072A65735,"To start off with, electing electors sounds a little bit redundant. Also, why do we vote for somebody that can vote in their own right as mentioned in article two provided to me? I say as a citizen of the United States that we should vote directly to determine the new president.

If we vote for a representative of our state to elect our president, how can we be certain that he/she will vote as planned? The entire system is far from perfection, but can be fixed temporally. By changing the amount of votes to numbers that be added to equal the amount of representatives respectivly, it can provide an estamation of how many representatives from a state can elect a certain party. For example, if 4,000,000 people vote for republican and 16,000,000 vote democrat in a state with 10 representatives, 2 representatives will vote republican, 8 will vote democrat.

However, if you do this, there will still be flaws in the system. The best way in my opinion of electing a presedent is to go ahead and let the people vote their opinion. Simple calculations to find percentages can determine the majority vote and elect the president/vice president, making things alot cheaper and more efficient. All by using a simple four-function calculator.

To wrap things up, I will state that even though I am only part of the minority of the U.S., I am still a citizen stating his/her opinion towards a better future towards my homeland.

8AC4654BB990,"Dear,Senator of Florida Im am writing this letter to tell you that we should keep our electoral college. Because that way there is less drama and fuzz about who shall be president. I mean regarless when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of elctors. The electroal college is widely regarded as an thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the president, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the cadidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But the good thing is trust because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. There is 5 reasons why we should keep electroral college, number one.""Certainty of Outcome"" A dispute over the outcome of an Electroral college vote is possible - it happened in 2000- but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Number two, ""Everyone's President"" this is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn't their president. Number 4,"" Big States "" the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the mal apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution.

C421AAB77B7E,"Dear senator,

I am not in favor of the electoral college. The electoral college may seem helpful in some ways in terms of voting, but not entirely. Think of it this way; you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether or not your votes are making a difference because you have no control over who the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.

Our county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no power for who is elected, does not help the case of being called ""corrupt"" or ""incorrect"". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the elecotrs cast their vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.

In addition to the fact the American people do not hace full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.

In paragraph eleven, it states that ""legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.

Take into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The popular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The popular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election. In paragraph 16 of the article, it states that ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)..."" Yes this trust may rarely be betrayed, but it is entirely possible. Just because it does not happen often, does not mean it is impossible...and who knows? What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?

Finally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system. Trust can always be betrayed, even if it does not happen often it can still happen without our knowledge. The people residing in the United States and under the laws of our country do not have full control on who is elected as president. I am, however in favor of election by popular vote. This means that a state casts its vote based on who the majority has voted for, and I truly believe this would system would best suit our country.                       ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5526ABFE6934,"The U.S. has been using the Electoral College for a long time.  I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?  Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is.  I dont think popular vote would get us a good president, people would pick the one who makes those promises that will only be good for a short time.  The U.S. needs a president who can asure us we wont have to worry about everybody losing there jobs soon or not being able to pay for gas because its up to $4.00 a gallon.

Its a very time managed process, its not like they take some names, write them on a piece of paper, mix them up in a hat, and grab the first one you feel.  How big of a mistake would that be? Electoral College even sounds like a well thought out idea, for one it has the word college in it and college is where you get a better education for your future.  When electing a President you want to know that you will have a good future with the president that is elected.  Just because the Electoral College is old doesnt mean it isnt a good process.

Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actuallt gone to Kennedy.)

Voting for the next President of the United States isn't something you would just want to rest in the hands of popular votes, you could end up with someone who doesnt even know what he is doing, or even desides he can't handle all of the responsibility of being the President.  I feel very strong about my thoughts on the subject and believe that the Electoral College is still the way to go.               ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Also, if the person does make a mistake they should be able to unelect them also cause people need what is best for are country.

When people elect the president they usally go back through there speaches and see what they had promised for our country and make sure it is what they want. If it is not what they want they would probably go to the next person who is trying to be the president. When you are electing always make sure you are mking the right decision and make sure that they please you because they could elect that person because of yur vote you never no what could happen when voting.

Do you think it would be a good idea to elect someone who you are not sure about ? Well i dont think it is because they made the country to a bad situation or even smething dangerous like a war.

I think we should get rid of the Electoral Collage vote. It's not fair that a majority of people get to vote extra. The candidate's get to choose people who will vote for the person who picked them just bc they picked them.

They candidate who did win the election their electorial voters get a przie just for helping them win the election. And the others well they get nothing. It's not fair to the other people who voted for their apponite. All they get is a ""Thanks for voting"". Presidents voters get a cerification for helping them when. It's not fair to everyone else. Sometimes they candidate they picked to win isn't even a good presidant. They can't hold up to their side of the deal. the President says he/she will fix our economy and then the economy drops. They say they will prvovied a better education for students and they don't. Two electors from the same state can go to Congress. The candidates pick people from the states who know that the will vote for that specific candidates. In 2000 campaign, in total, seventeen sates didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. In 25 of the largest media market a majority of voters did not go see any of the campaign ads. Candidates will bribe voters and Electorial Collage voters just to vote for that candidate and not they other.

4006B9AAD071,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a process of selecting electors to vote for the president. The Electoral College has both its pros and cons, many reasons for it to stay or be abolished. However, it has more reason to stay rather than changing to election by popular vote for the President.  The wnning canidate for U.S President should be who's the best rather rather than who's more popular. The Electoral College may not be the most democratic method but, it does create a sense of balance. The Electoral College has equal tran-regional appeal, and garuntees an outcome. Therfore, the Electoral College should not be abolished.

The Electoral College garuntees an outcome. With popular voting and a tie could occur. As, Souce 3; ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised methaod of choosing the President"" informs ""The reason is that the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College invariable exceeds his share of the popular vote.""(18). So the losing canidate could argue that winner isn't who the people want however, it's the political party members who chose the electors. In, Source 1; ""What is the Electoral College?"", it states that ""Each canidate ruinning for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the canidate's political party..."" Therefore, there is no mystery or deciet, each party knows their electors and canidates so the people are the ones who indirectly chose the winner. As a result, the Electoral College promises an undebatabe outcome.

Also,the Electoral College doesn't have any prejudice based on region or location. ""The Electoral College requires to have a trans-regional appeal."" (sorce 3).  Therefore, a canidate has to campiaign in all regions, withought just focusing on just one. So every region has an equal oppurtunity and knowledge to be able to vote. Also this way there's a less chance of ""The residents of other reions to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn't their president.""(19). That feeling of equality and ""my opinion matters"" is exactly what America is about and this aspect of the Electoral College captures that beautifully.

In conclusion, the Electoral college may not be the most democratic way of voting however, it is quite fair.  If we only had popular voting canidates would possible just focuse on one are to build a strong support base. This would'nt give every region or person a fair chance and strong word, which is against everything America stands for. Equality is one of the major virtues of America and the Electoral College expresses equality through balance more so than popular vote. The Electoral College garuntees a certaint outcome without debates or tie breakers. It allows every region to have a fair chance in the election by making sure they are well informed and included through the recquirment of trans-regional appeal. For these reasons the Electoral College should not be abolished and changed to popular vote for United States of America.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D961DBB356D3,"Dear State Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME, and I beleive that America should change to a popular voting system. I believe this because nobody wants to have someone else to vote for them. With the pop. vote system, everyone will be able to voice their opinion, instead of X amount of senators deciding who they like. To me, it seems unfair to let 5 people decide what thousands of other people want. If you would, please let me present my evidence for a pop. voting system.

To vote, you must be 18,an adult. When your an adult, you dont have parents anymore to decide what is ""best"" for you. Having representatives ""represent"" the people, they are being the parents who try and control their childs life! We fought a war to become independent and let the people decide what they want, yet this ""land of the free"" is becoming less free every day. Letting the people vote will give us back a major part of the American dream.

Another reason is the ratio of citizens to representatives. In California, it is 35,000,000 being ""represented for"" by 55 people, who could be biased people who are can be choosen by ""the states central party comittee, and even the

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES THEMSLEVES

"". That is like asking your closest friends( or sombody you payed, in the presidential candidate's case) if you or the lonely kid at school to vote who is most popular. That seems very messed up to me.

Finally, the 5 people that vote could be anti anything! In 1960, racists in the louisiana legislature( some of the ""special"" people who vote for who is a representative) tryed to instill new representatives who would oppose JFK. What if a woman ran for presedent, than a bunch of states instilled sexist representatives to ruin her chance of winning? What if another african american trys to run, but is shot down by newly apointed racist representatives? I sure an heck dont want me or my state to be represented by 27 racist/sexist ""representatives"".

All in all, our current system as major problems. People are not able to voice their opinion. Insted, we are letting a handfull of representatives speak their opinion,and say its what us normal people want. Not to mention, these are people that cant be apointed due to bias. Finally, the representatives that the biased people choose, in special groups of 55-3 people representing millions, can be anti whatever,or just not like the person for a stupid reason( for example ""I dont like his haircut, its to short/he looks like a pedophile""). If you would, please consider my idea of a truly free america, or even spread my word to the people.Thank you for your time.

84AD2A5BF53E,"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral College consits of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for thePresident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows much worse.

""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" (Source 1). However not everyone thinks this is fair. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Source 2) So as a result, it is not the people voting for their president, but it is the slate electors. Voting should be based off of popular vote because theb electors might not always be picked fairly, the ""winner-take-all system,"" and what happens when there is a tie.

""Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidental canidates themselves."" (Source 2) This can be a problem because voters can not control who their electors vote for, because now the decision is in their hands. Also, voters sometimes will get confused about the electors and then will vote for the wrong canidate. The electoral college is also unfair because of the winner-take-all system. According to source 2, ""Canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races.""

Another common concern in the electoral voting process is ""What happens when there is a tie?"" If there is a tie, the election then goes to The House of Representatives where they then have the state delegations vote on the president. This is your country, so don't you want to have a say on who runs it? ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect then will of the people."" (Source 2)

In Conclusion, we should change voting to popular vote. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Source 2) The Electoral College is not always fair, and at times can be uncertain. As the people we should be able to vote for our president, and not have to leave it up to The House of Representives to make the right choice for us.

D8ED809B7F92,"Dear Senator,

I feel as if you should keep the Electoral College as it is. Our country is so messed up that we have a lot of our people not working or just getting well-fair. To be honest, that isnt fair that they get a vote. Who are they going to choose when it comes to voting? Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money? Not me!

The article states that yes the electors may choose differently from what the people and the popularity wanted. I dont think that matters because why would they vote for someone who isnt fit to be president? If they are even up there, they are fit. So I think the Electoral College is just fine of a process to use for the United States of America. Yes, maybe our electors dont see certain benefits one canidate might be offering or doesnt understand as to why one might be better in your eyes. But in the end, the president we choose is probably not even going to actually do half the things he promised so who cares?

If we want this country to go anywere we need to let the people who actually understand what the men up on the campains telling the people of america a bunch of lies really offer us. They know whats good for us and thats why they are voting for them.

I hope you understand where I am coming from.

0AC09FD13E72,"This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney""Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis."" So yes that is why the electoral college shouldn't be removed.

But the Electoral College also have rules in this article by Richard Posner ""The Electoral College reguires a presidential candidate to have no tran-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect President."" Like think about it if one of the big states for example lets say Texas wants to vote for canidate but two smaller states want to vote for another canidate but they don't have enough votes to compete with that one big state then the bigger states would always wn the elections and that dosnt make the elections fair like thet should be and that just makes it worse that ""it is"" now beacuse with the electoral college it makes the voting fair because they can see the what all the states want and they can choose who is right for the poisition. People might have other opinions and that is completley fine but at the end of the day a disision has to made and it would be best if it was the best desision for the people being made.

Now back to what the downsides are of the electral college ""The single best argument against the electoral college what we might call the dissaster factor."" a part of Bradford Plumer's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong."" Even just in the name of that article explains everything that event he ""best"" type of system can be a dissaster, and the entire article cannot be quoted but hopefully with that one quote the point will get across to the people. Everyone should read some sourses before making an disision like this. Not just the people voting so that even the people not voting will fully understand why one disision is being made and whyone isnt being made. This one thing can affect the way electing president will be from now on to the future, unless they deside they want to change it again.

All in all one letter will not change everyone's opinion but it seems like the people who want to remove the electoral college are anachronism instead of the electoral college themselfs it seems like they want to remove them so that the winner take all system will be better on there half so that the running canidate can appeal to the bigger states and win most of their votes.""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to expresss a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" There is nother more that can be said but the reason why this letter was written in the first place, to keep the electoral college.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I feel that you should change to the popular vote for the President of the United States. That way they people can really choose who they want to be president instead of the government having to jump in and help the people choose who they want as president and some people dont vote because they know it doesnt matter.

With Electoral College the voters don't vote for a president, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For example the Jhon Kerry ''voting'' if you were in Texas you voted for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that pledged to John Kerry. The Electoral College is a process that makes voting easier for the government. They have to select electors, then they all have a meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and then the counting of the eletoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors. But a major of 270 electroal votes in order to elect the President. Another example John F. Kennedy had a popular that vote would have went to him.

The Electoral college is unfair to voters,because of the winner-take-all system in each state, the candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, which focuses only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It as become unfair,outdated,and irratonal. The electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism. We are in need of a change because this has been going on for years and years. So why not change it up i think it should have been done a while ago but it never to late.

The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. Which is not every fair some people are'nt as rih as others so they sould'nt descrimate people by the way they look or dress. Because for all you know they look gurst so your not going to try and listen or understand where they came from. But they could be President material they just dont have the outter look, that everyones looking for.""Don't judge a book by it cover.""

The swing states go through the most with the electoral college,because its a winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as seen in election. Voters in toss up states are more likely to payclose attentionto the campaign. They get the most feed back for the government. Also they get attention from the candidates as while. The bigger states dont get much attention.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
ECC6BDC4B664,"Dear Senator; the electoral voting system should be abolished it is unfair and un-democratic electoral votes are not the votes f the people and thats all that should matter but there are countercaims that I will address. when aperson votes they do not actually vote for their candidate they vote for a group of electors for that candidate electors who may not even vote for the candidate they are sworn to. the electoral voting system is extremly unstable there are an even number of electoral voters in the united states making a tied vote a possibility which is very bad. Even though electoral votes are suposedly based on which candidates people vote for it does not at all mean that the candidate who most of the people voted for wil also be voted for by the electoral college.

The electoral voters are seperated by state and each state has its own number of electoral voters proportional to their population. because of this candidates change their campaigns to only focus on stateswith more electoral voters while this makes sense from a competitive perspective it makes it extremley unfair to states with smaller populations. This is wrong in many ways but the worst of all is that the electoral voting system encourages this kind of copetition

The electoral voting system is un-democratic the united states prides itself on being for the people and freedom but the electoral college represents the exact opposite of that. the electoral college votes not the people. the people are not voting and that is the exact opposite of what the united states supossedly stands for. Anyone who learns about the united states and sees the electoral colege will think that the united states. is not all its cracked up to be and that is not what the united states wants is it?

in conlcusion the senator you should definetly try to work toward abolishing the electoral college as it is un-democratic because it does not allow the people to have a direct say in who they are voting for. it is a very volatile voting system that could cause crashes and severities in the united states by aving tied votes and such. the electoral voting system uncourages some states to be left out by unfair competition because of the unstable way the number of electoral voters are balanced between states.

2976B22ED93F,"Dear Senator,

Many people might agree that we shouldn't have an Electoral College at all, since most of the time it doesn't seem to work at all since of instead just voting on the person or candidate you would prefer, you instead vote for a slate of electors instead of the prefered candidate. This is not the case, however, and in fact, the Electoral College does seem to function. It can be proven in two simple reasons on why the Electoral College still works- certainty of outcome and the simple fact that it's everyone's president.

Foremost, the certainty of outcome can eaisly prove why the Electoral College still works. If we even do go to a system where we actually vote for popular vote, it would work as well as we do right now with the Electoral College, since there will be more disputes on popular vote than on the Electoral College. In Richard A. Posner's article on the defense for the Electoral College, he states in his first reason on why their would be much dispute over popular vote than on the Electoral College, and why it's less likely to happen on a Electoral College. He states ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" It's true, after all that the Electoral College's votes exceed over the popular votes. It could be also said that even if the government actually switches to popular vote, we know it would work since it does not exceed how on Electoral College votes go, which can be also seen as a simpler process of voting. On another note, in some cases, there can be ties between two candidates, as seen in 1992's Election between Nixon and Clinton on the popular vote. To summarize, the certainty of outcome is far greater in the Electoral College rather than the popular vote due to sheer number of votes in the Electoral College.

On a second note, the fact that the american people can vote enough that it's everyone's president is another reason on why the Electoral Colllege does work. The Electoral College works by havng the winner win trans-regionally rather than just focus on just on region that just favors them and only them. So instead of one region getting the candidate that prefers and focuses on only them, everyone can have a candidate that will focus largely on the nation's issues rather than just a specific part ot the country. For example, let's say that the largest population of people in a regon in the United States is the south (not saying it is or isn't, it's just an example). The south is mainly republican, so they will only vote for a republican that will focus majorly on the south. It is unfair for the rest of the regions, such as the Northeast, Middle, Pacific, and other regions of the United States, since they are mainly democratic (not really, it is used as an example) who would want focus on their region as well, too. In Bradford Plumers's article on why the Electoral College should be gone, he states that the electoral college is unfair to voters, since most candidates did not bother with the states they know they have no chance of winning at all. There could be an easy counter argument against this, since those states have probably already made up their minds on who to vote for, like a democratic candidate visiting Texas (where it's mainly republican), they know who Texas is going to vote for, there is no use in trying to convince them when they have already made up their minds, same goes if a republican candidate tries to convince the democratic California, they already know there is no use in reasoning and convincing when someone has already made up their mind. Also, someone can easily counterattack most of the arguments brought up in th Plumer's article, since this was written before the 2004 election, and it has been a decade already, plenty of things could've changed during the course if ten years in politics. In order to make a greater argument against the electoral college, one must have an updated list of facts in order to back it up, as certain things could've changed during a certain course of a decade. During the course of a decade, we seen how affective the electoral college was during the 2004 elections (people who disagreed during the 2004 elections and also agree that the electoral college doesn't work at all have to see the events that transpired before the 2004 elections and the promises made before it also), the 2008 elections (again, if the people disagreed on how the electoral college worked at that time, you would need to look at how people saw change during that time and the amount of younger citizens voting at that time), and the 2012 elections as well (also again, if disagreeing with the electoral college is reasonable at that time, you would need to look at how people reacted at that time and how different events before the election affected the outcome). In a final note, the electoral college is the vote on the people's president is true, and withholds it since it can focus on rather than on one specific region, but the nation as a whole.

In summarization, the electoral college should be kept due to the simple reasoning of certainty of outcome and the voting on the people's president. The reasoning of certainty of outcome can be applied here is due to the simple fact that the votes for the electoral college are far more greater than the votes for popular vote, same goes to the voting on the people's president, since it focuses on the entire nation rather that just one region of the country. Senator, we should be able to keep our electoral college, as it proves effective during the recent elections, and can certainly prove itself useful and reliable during the next elections to come.

F1CE49620429,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College should not be the deciding vote for the president of the United States of America. Every popular vote of the people should be counted towards deciding the next president. If America is a democracy and in a democracy people pick the leader then every citizen's vote should count, not just the majority.

First things first, only a few states have taken action towards my claim. Those being Maine and Nebraska. These states have made a ""proportional representation"", which is unlike the ""winner take all"" that the other 48 states have adopted. The text states ""Most states have a winner take all method system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"" (What Is the Electoral College?7).This portrays that with the ""winner take all"" method various amounts of U.S. citizen votes have gone unaccounted for.

Multiple occasions have dimmed the surface of our elections where their voices aren't heard. The author says ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plumer 11). Going into this further, that means that one person can disagree with hundreds of people's votes for his own vote of the opposite party. Also, if a tie was to occur int the total electoral votes then the outcome would be put into the hands of the House of Representitives. If the people were to vote in the first place this occurance would have never came close.

On the other hand, it is much harder to calculate the total number of the  popular vote being that there are millions of people voting. It is much easier to count and not dispute over a hundred or so votes than a million. But, having people know that their vote doesn't make it to actually voting for the president makes them not as ethuisiastic about voting. The text says ""no voter's vote swings an election""(Posner 23). This explains why only about one half of eligible American voters voted.

In conclusion, America is a democracy, which means people elect the president, not a elector but the people. The author states ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer 14). This further explains that electors cannot make decisions without being biased toward their party.

F680F4460788,"Dear state senator,

My letter is in regards to changing the election to popular vote for the president of the United States. I believe that we, the people, should have the opportunity to choose whom we wish to become President.

The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote. It's a big deal for people to go out and take action. So what would make the electoral college change one view of voting? Its the fact that we aren't really voting for our president. We are voting for our electors of the state, to vote for our president. And on top of that, there are still many people out there who don't have a clue that their actually voting for someone in our state to decide for us. Although the electoral college does help make the presidential election less complicated, it's the mere fact that WE aren't making much of a difference.

The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. When it comes to voting for electors, its a difficult thing when it comes to how many electors represent which political party. Democrat, or Republican. Say one wanted the one candidate running for president to win, and he/she were Republican. That person would go out and cast a vote for a slate of however many of republican electors there are for that state. The part that gets a lot of people is that there could be fewer Republican electors then there are Democrat electors. Say one still wanted the Republican candidate to win and they voted in their residential state which was Nevada. IF Nevada had 4 Republican electors then that meant anyone who voted for the Democrat electoral wasn't chipping in much to the election. In the end, all the electors votes are counted for each side, and because Nevada had only two dedicated Democrats, the chances of the Democrat candidate having less electoral votes then the Republican candidate, has increased. If this problem happenes for several other states, then the chances double, even triple.

If this doesn't make you think that the electoral college should go, then think again. The electoral college is definitely unfair to voters. Any chance of unfaithful electors, could happen. It could make one feel betrayed that they voted foe a specific elector to do one job. Which was to help select the president the voter wanted. Whats the point in putting your trust in someone who could just easily turn around and NOT vote who you wanted? There is no point. But that's what we're doing when we vote. We are making it an option for that to happen. So why not vote by popular vote? Why not avoid all the issues the electoral college can cause for us? We should be lucky that back in '00, that was the biggest election crisis and it COULD'VE been worse.

In conclusion, we the people, should have the opportunity to vote and actually have our vote counted. Because every state doesnt't have the sam eamount of people in each, the chances of there being a tie in the presidential election, is slightly unlikely. Other then there being a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the votes add up tp 538; an even number. We shouldn;t put ourselves through this, and truth be told, the election is confusing as it is. I say, we should get rid of the electoral college.

ED3AE3322B08,"Dear Senate,

It's offical, The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's really hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: ""Abolish the Electoral College.""

The Electoral College is a non-democraic method of selectiong a president that will be by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. According the the ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" article,"" the Elecoral College method is not democraic in a modern sense.....it is the electors who elect the president not the people."" So bascially we are voting for the electors and we keep our finger crossed that they vote for the president we want. It is unpractical that the people vote for the president they would like to govern their counrty and then the opposite party wins. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly ater Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College, won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct elecion to the kind we have now. The last election was yet another close one thanks to the Electoral College, which the popular vote winner lost the presidency. After all of this the Electoral College still has its defenders...

At the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates that don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.  During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.(Source 2)

The Elector Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. But other types of voters just like the ""play around"" according to article two.

The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apporionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution but is this system really the most logical one to use?(Source 3). True this system has worked for many years but it is time for a change. People are starting to think it is unfair and really poinless to even vote when the president they want will possibly not win anyway.

The single best argument against the Electoral College is what we might call the disater factor.( Source 1) The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. (Source 2) Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that popular vote would not have gone to Kennedy. (Source 3) In the same vein, ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. There are some reasons for retaining the Electoral College but it still lacks democratic pediree. And the people should have the right to vote on the president they think is the best for

We dont even know who the electors really are they could have been picked by anyone like how it says in paragraph 10 they could have been picked by the presidential candidates themselves who knows. They say we control who the electors vote for but not always , theres a high unlikely chance that there would be more popular votes for one president like in texas for john kerry that all 34 electors would go to congress and vote for john kerry thats insane.

A second reason is how theres a bigger chance of electoral college tie happening then a popular vote one like how it says in paragraph 12 "" in 1916 , a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and a 3,3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe"". If the electoral college has a tie then theres even a bigger chance of the people voice not being heard at all. Once a tie happens the election goes to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president as said in paragraph 12 , a single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters, would have no say compared to the 55 representatives from California that makes Wyoming have no voice in the election compared to Califorina. The house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

Finally thats all i have to say regarding how the election should be changed to having the popular vote determine the president , we want our voice to be heard! Sometimes the electoral college doesnt pick the president that we wanted and if there was a tie to happen in the electoral college which is at high risk some of the states voices wouldnt get heard at all , thats why we should switch over to popular vote maybe more people would actually get up and go vote because they would know their vote actually means something. Like it says in paragraph 14 "" Abolish the electoral college! "".    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

E757E8BA280F,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I am writing you concerning a topic that is very important to our country, and the citizens that preside in it. The electoral college is the current method of determining who will be elected as the president of the United states of America. As you know, it does so by allowing our citizens to vote for electors that then choose who they want as president for us. Citizens will most often vote for an elector that has sworn to vote for either the democratic or republican party's candidates for president. However, I don't quite agree with this method of election. Through my research on this subject, I have discovered that not only do these citizens not have the access to vote directly for who they want to run their country, but also that many electors go back on their word and vote for another party's candidate. I believe the system should be changed and the president should be elected through popular vote, and I'm not alone, according to a Gallup poll taken in 2000, over 60% of the population agrees with me.

If the popular vote elects the president, every citizen will have their own choice on who they want as a president. In an electoral college, many people will merely have their votes casted aside becausetheir decisions or thoughts aren't the same as eveyone else in their state. Though some people say an electoral college is positive because it requires the candidateto have more than just regional appeal, but if people in that state like a specific candidate, even if they vote for an elector, the rest of their state may not like that candidate, and that person's vote will be cast away.

Also, the electoral college doesn't always follow the peoples' vote. For example, if there were to be a tie in the electoral college, the election would be given to the

House of Representatives. Since many people vote for a different party candidate than who they vote for, for the House of Representatives, they would not get their vote for president counted for anything, and the House may choose the president they don't want, without getting a say in any of it. Not to mention the 2000 election when Al

Gore got more votes overall, but Bush won the presidency due to the unfair, outdated system of the electoral college. The electoral college puts the decision of who will be the president into a couple hundred peoples' hands, instead of every American citizen.

Another reason for changing the method  to popular vote is the fact that all of the electors count the same. Since each state only counts for one electoral vote, the one elector from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, will count for the same as the 55 electors from, California, who represent 35 million voters. That simply isn't fair because it's the same as saying the opinions of only 500,000 voters in Wyoming are as influencial and important  as the entire 35 million voters' opinions from

California. The fact that not all American citizens, promised to be able to vote for who will lead their country and influence their everyday life, are able to do so is absurd.

Many people argue and say that just one vote won't make a difference, but there are 34,500,000 people in California alone that are being disregarded and not counted for anything more than the 500,000 in Wyoming.

Why should the people living in smaller states have more influence than those with larger populations? Why shouldn't those 34.5 million people in California be able to make their own decision and choose their own vote for the President? The entire population of every single state in the United States of America, that has the legal right to do so, should be able to vote, and to have their vote actually counted for something instead of just having their decision made for them by someone they've never even met. With the popular vote deciding who will be president, everyone will matter just the same, which is how it should be since we are all created equal, and we all should have the equal power to decide how our country will be governed and who will govern it, we should all be counted; not just the small percentage that is at the top. Thank you for your time and consideration.

D50B2015BE66,"Dear State Senator,

Lately there has been lots of tense debates on whether to keep Electoral College votes or not. Well I agree with the citizens who do agree on keeping our votes. Its just rude to take away something we rightfully deserve. Electors come to the campus or a specific area to give their great speech that appeals to what we want to be done just to get our votes. Well Mr. Senator it isn't ok for you and the others in office to just take away Electral College voting.

According to this article written by : The Office of the Fedral register,

"" the Founding fathers esatblished it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popuar vote of qualifed citizens.""

that little bit of information says a popular vote I believe the Electoral College is that popular vote. After the electors are selected and meet to discuss who would be Preident and Vice President but also need to count the Electoral votes. Not only does the congress count the electoral votes , there is 538 electors but at least 270 votes are required to elect the preisdent.

In another article it explains how the year of

""2000 was a fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century.""

There is a example

Al Gore he won the popular vote but not the presidency .And that majority would have preferred a direct election. Also the electoral voters system voted slate, an example given from the story was if I lived in Texas I would vote for Jonh Kerry, then vote for slate of 34 democratic electorsthat pledged to Kerrry.

Even with great arguments of wiping out Electoral votes , it will still remain

""unfair outdated and irrational

"" I see a picture which shows the number of electroal votes that each state is granted. Some states are granted more than other states but that doesn't stop them from voting. There are fueds over the outcome,picking the president, then goes into the swing states, Big states, and run-off elections .

Now the certainty of outcome of a Electoral vote its not likey to beat a popular vote.

But electoral votes win because those votes are more than popular votes. Back in 2012 voting the article says"" Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the poplular votes.""

and that help Obama win on the winner-take-all basis. Now with picking the president they can't recieved gain of votes where ever there from or very well favored. A president with regional appeal isn't likey to be a successful president.

Now those swing states, with the winner-take-all method and being awarded with electoral votes. But voters in the toss-up states are the ones who really pay attention and listen to competators in the campagion. And decide the election. But in the big states electoral college restores the political balance which large states lost by virtue. The bug states get more of the canidate attention than small states because big states has more population.

Refering back to the article it says electoral avoids the problems with elections , with that no canidate recieves no votes from that majority.

Imagine back in 1968 with Nixon and Clinton in 1992 both only gotten 43 pecent of the popular votes . The pressure of a run-off election is when no canidate wins , it will greatly make things complicated in the presidental elction.

So no Senator you and your fellow peers whom decided to eliminate electoral votes is dispicable. When we actually have a chance to vote you take it away. Its very clear that without the electoral votes it woud be more than just presidental complication it would also be complication with decideing electors, presidntal electors and the big states who canidates get there precious votes from would have a hard time winning.

I agree to keeping the Electoral College vote and not to change it to no popular vote because popular vote over rules most of the time. So please over think your decsion with other senators and keep Electoral College votes.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

C29C6C6A5F04,"To State Senator,

As many believe, the nation of the Unitred States of America is one of the most free countries. The citizens have more power and rights then those of another country. Although, are we truely getting the power we claim to get. One of the biggest powers a citizen of the US recieves is electing the president who will serve a term for the next four years. But, do we truely recieve that power. No if there is an Electorial College. The govnerment claims that we are the one truely electing the president, and many of the citizen even believe that, but the fact is that the Electorial College take away all of those rights. This government group doesnt always follow the word of the people, it is unfair, and the ""winner-takes-all"" mathod does not show what the true outcome should be.

When the Founding Fatrhers developted this country, they had stricted standards in mind, ""The people would have a say."" If we where fallowing the wishes of our Founding Fathers, we would not allow our nation to make false acuizations about what the people are acually capable of doing. Say the state has a majority of Republican vote, so we then send 27 Rebulican electors to the Electorial College. Although, it is copletely possible that our electors don't follow the word of the people, and vote for something other than what they had said before. This shows that although the state's citizens can chose the electors, we acually have no role in the final election of our President. As said in The Indefensible Electorial College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, ""Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes the state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential canidates themselves."" This proves that there is no set system in place for choose this extremely important electors that are the electors of how our country survives the next four years. They said that it is even possible for the presidential canidates themselves to the be the ones to choose the electors. Will the follow the word of the peoplem, or just choose based on what is best for them? No one know. By doing this, we are putting our whole future in someone elses hands.

Not to mention, the whole election proccess is unfair for both the citizens and the presidential canidates. If there is a majority vote from the people throughout the nation for one party, once the Electorial College votes, the peoples decition can be overridded. This means that not only is the next president going to be someone that most of the citizens didn't want, but the presidential candidate who should have won, now is stuck is a possition where the country wants him in office, but it is over. If the people get to vote, let them vote. Why claim to give them something, waste their time, aswell as yours, and then have that concencous not make a difference? If the government where truely looking to help and do what the people want and need, then they would trust us to put the right person in office.

Lastly, the system put in place for the Electorial College is not a strong system. The ""winner-takes-all"" method does not allow for a truelly acurate election. When the state votes, for example, two thirds democratic, then only two thirds of our electors should be democratic. With this you are getting a complete representaion of the wants of the people. As state in What Is the Electorial College, ""Most states have a winner-takes-all"" system that awatds all electors to the winning prsidential canidate."" This means that even if the votes where close, like 50 percent plus one, they majority voted party would get 100 percent of the electors. That math make no sence. If voting for out future is not in out own hands, then let the people who are taking the responsability truely reflect our own thoughts.

With elections for many different things, there are always winner and loosers, that is just how the game works. Although, the game shouldnt work as if there was a set winner. In that case, there is no use in even playing. When the electors are chosen to elect the next President, we, as citizens have no idea if that is the proper peson to choose. We don't know that that person will completly fulfill the resposability they have are being the hands of the people. The Electorial College takes away our rights, is completly unfair all all sides of the story, and has a bad system set in palce. With all of this said, there is no need for it. It does nothing but hurt us and have the possibility of making false elections. We have the ""right to vot,"" let us truely and completely fulfill that right.

The Electoral College is not what it used to be, its not the most effecent way anymore. The people should decide this time, I am not saying get rid of it. But we should change it.

There are many people who agree with me. Over sixty percent of the vters would like a more direct system of voteing (according to a Gallup poll in 2000). And so did Ritchard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and AFL-CIO.

The main reason why people want a change is for all the qurks in the Electoral College system. For example, if you lived in Texas. And you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electoers. Witch in most cases would be O.K., but they could betray the party and vote for whom they please. It doesn't always happen but the possibility is real.  And people, like the segregationists back in 1960, could have gone agenst their party and pick electors to go agenst Kennedy.

In my honest opinion I dont even think that we should have a President. Presidents dont do anything other than make things worst for our country. What they do is maybe fix one or two things that the previous president did wrong but they add more problems for each president to fix so instead of trying to add more problems to us just dont do the job and give work to the government because obviously the government has enough time to make up lies and excuses on why things happen when instead the government themselves can do it, that way no excuses have to be made up.

It may not be my place to talk about the government at all because I dont know what they are talking about but honestly thats not the point, the point is that Americans are too dumb to realize when the Government is lying or even telling the truth because they can never hear the real truth everything is the truth to them but if you deep and deep and deep youll find more and more things that to get suspious and you question yourself but youll never get to know the REAL truth because our government is corrupted and they lie to us Americans every time there is misery.

Then anyones whos not holding office can be a elector. What makes them so qualified? nothing. Whydoes everyone just cast a vote and they all get counted up and thats whos wins the election? I know why becaus ethe government like to be complicated.

The electors could vote who ever they want they dont have to vote for the person you say, like back in 1960, in Louisiana legislatture nearly succeeded in replacing Domocratic electors with new electors who oppose Jonh F. Kennedy so the the popular would not have gone to him.

E046108929C0,"Dear State Senator,

For years, the presidential election has been running with an Electoral College, one in which the public does not vote for their choice canidate directly, but instead for a slate of electors to have a final deciding vote. Although the system could have worked like a breeze when first originated-- a point to be reckoned with, since I do not see how the system ever correctly displayed the citizens of America-- the Electoral College method has proven itself to be un-deomcratic, unfair, and an unjustly irrational system.

Simply stated, the Electoral College does not allow an accurate representation of voter's beliefs, taking their votes and twisting, manipulating them into a deciding vote from electors. The popular vote can be seen as an input/output machine, the people's own votes going in the contraption, and once inside, the input is stretched and exagerated to output a ""neater"" electoral vote out of 538. While some argue that the Electoral College vote is usually rather close to the popular vote, it just isn't the same as when the Constution loosely states America as a  'for the people, by the people' nation.

Several times throughout history, the Electoral college has swayed the presidential election in a completely different route than what the outcome of the popular vote would have been. The perfect example, constantly brought up in arguments against the Electoral college, is the 2000 election with main canidates of Republican George Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Through the popular vote, it is clearly seen that a majority of voters chose Al Gore to be their president. Through the process of the electoral college and manipulation of votes, though, the Presidental canidate ended with George Bush winning the election with a 271 electoral votes versus a 266 pointed toward Gore, thus creating an entirely different viewpoint of the people.

The idea of an Electoral College is also what has swung possible voters out of voting rooms, the voting method's 'winner takes all' outlook overriding. With the set up of the Electoral college, popular voters decievingly decide for a slate of electors instead of a President. For example, if a majority of Florida electors voted for Bush, the entirety of Florida's 29 votes are down for Bush, even though not all electors really did vote that way. Those citizens in states who do not fit with what large majority of voters believe are discouraged in voting for their own canidate knowning that, no matter what, it's almost certain their state will end up giving its votes to the canidate they oppose. This can lead voters to not voting at all, creating an even less accurate election while the country pushes citizens to vote, frowning down on them if they do not.

Besides major points, there are many smaller faults wiithin the Electoral college. In example, there is always the possibility of a slate voting for a canidate that differs from the one they have pratically promised to vote for. The fate of our country is put into the hands of the 538 members of the electoral college, opposed to the vastly greater full population of American citizens. Also, with the 538 Electoral College members being an even number, although rare, it is more likely for there to be a tie than if the popular vote was used in deciding the presidential canidate.

A pro Electoral college argument is that the citzens in swing states-- states that are likely to go either way in an election instead of an almost certian outcome-- are more likely to pay attention to ad campaigns knowing that their state is most likely what will decide the winner of the election. Advocates say that they are, on average, most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, and that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide our nations outcome. This outlook is littered with flaws, first starting off with the fact that swing states get more media coverage than the rest of the nation. These voters are valued more than others and are given more information to have an informed vote. Besides the fact that it is proposterous to value the vote of one citizen over another, this isn't fair to members of other states who recieve virtually no coverage due to canidates feeling like the state's vote has been secured since day one. The nation as a whole should recieve all the facts together with equal coverage, so that each and every voter can become a thoughtful one, and not only those located in swing states.

All in all, the decision to abolish the Electoral College is a backed up one, the facts and details there to support, meanwhile advocates for the practically ancient method don't have many solid counters to prove their point.

I hope you take this letter and it's claims into consideration.

CFB99F0D0D31,"Dear Senator,

I believe that we should keep the Electoral College voting instead of changing it because it produces a clear winner, shows what percentage of the state voted for whom and is easier to count the votes.

It produces a clear winner because instead of doing it by numbers it is by percentages. If you see it in percntages you will know right away. If we were to change it to most popular vote you would not get an exact number so you would have to tally up and see who is the winner. It states that it produces a clear winner by the percentages.

It shows what state voted for whom. What I mean by that is on the map it will show if the state voted more for Republican or Democratic. If 60% of the state voted for a Republican than it shows what percent. Instead of counting out those long numbers they can just add up all the percentages and get their winner right there.

It is a lot easier to count all the votes because if it shows that 60% of the state voted for Republican than that goes into the books. So instead of counting each and every vote they just add up all the percentages and then they have their clear winner.

If we were to change to most popular vote it would not be fair because it does not show an exact number or percentage. It would become another war because if it just shows most popular vot instead of who is really good for the job our world would become an aweful place to live in. You dont know if that person is truly able to be put into that job.

Yes there are some pros and cons to this but would you rather be put into office for most popular votes, not the most votes. Or would you rather be put into office saying I beat this guy in the race and I won fair and square.

We should keep the Electoral Collage in session because it produces a clear winner, showes a percentage of votes for each state and is a lot easier to count all the votes. Lets not change what is already going well for us. Keep it going. Dont stop it now.

""The founding fathers established... the Constitution"" to make sure that there was a way to vote for one elector to portray the role of President of the United States of America. However, this action has resulted in electors to lose even though they won the popular vote, the age of the electoral college, and there are numerous possibilities of ties. In the United States there are hundreds of millions of people who want to keep the United States a democracy, but the United States may change their stand point.

Popular votes are collected from the people of the United States. With stating this, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This is because voters will be able to have only their votes taken into consideration. For example, the President of the United States is the offical who sends people to places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Iran to fight for our country. These people vote for the elector they want to send them over seas instead of the politicians in the electoral college system voting for who they want to be the president. There are only 538 electors to vote for the elector they desire and that is still more important than the millions of people that vote. ""We are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" is a part of the Declaration of Independence and the right of liberty involves our right as people to vote.

The electoral college has be are for hundreds of years, but with the age of the system comes problems. In modern times, we have to make slight changes to our government so the United States does not get held back from when the Constitution was first created. Things are meant to change and so is the electoral college because over time thins changes to better and more efficient things. ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" This evidence exclaims that there was a problem with the electoral college 15 years ago, which means that it can happen again.

Furthermore, the electoral college already has problems and there can be more with the possibilities of a tie. It states, ""perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.,"" this is not a democratic thing because democracy has to do with the vote of people, not the vote of the legislature. Also, in source 2, it exclaims that ""the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."" This is a dangerous situations because if a tie occurs the popular vote still won't be taken into consideration as much as the electoral votes.

To conclude, the electoral college system should be abolished because it does not benefit the citizens of the United States. The elecotral college takes away the popular vote of the people, is way too old to still be around, and there are possibilities of a tie. I don't want my President to be voted in based on the votes of the legislature. The electoral college should be abolished!

The president of the United States of America should be chosen by popular vote rather than the Electoral College because is allows citizens of the U.S. to have more power.

I think we should in take concideration in the next few years about changing are election to popular vote. I feel that are state would benefit in a positive way with the way that popular vote is set up. looking at the  past history the electoral college is not benefiting us in a positive direction. i qutoe this from the article ""over 60 percent of voters would pefer a direct election""with that being said lets look at the cons of the electoral college.

To begin with the electoral college system the people like me dont get to vote for president i have to vote for someone else to vote for me in that i feel like my vote doesnt count because what happens if i vote for a elector and he doesnt go for my person to win. That just makes me feel dumb then if the elector does vote for the same person asme its not really even final becuase that vote doesnt go towards the president it goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice. another con in the electoral college system is that the same fiasco in 2000 will break out again. were the legislatures are responsible for picking electors and they dont take in to concideration of other people votes. the con that could mostly impact america is a tie in the electoral vote. another reason the electoral college is an stupid way to vote is that the big states get better privelges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states. Its final the electoral college is unfair outdatedand irrational.

the only reasons the electoral college is alive now is the cetainty outcome,everystates president,swing states,runoff elections .run off electionsn means basically  there will never be a blow out in the voting polls it will always be compitive with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president the will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. the swing states is sayiong that there one state isnt going to decide the whole election.                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Abolishing The Electoral College

We are the United States of America. We have learned that we have the freedom of free speech, practices, and choices. This is what we have learned that we supposively do. If we can't pick out who will rule over us, then what are we doing with ourselfs?

We deserve to have a choice in choosing who will rule our country. The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers in the Constitution. Constitutions like these eventually get revised. This method is too outdated.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have all agreeded that to abolish the electoral college. Popular votes was something they all had in mind when choosing the president. It was shown the 60% of voters would prefer a direct election, than having the electoral college. That's more than half!

The best argument against it, is the the disaster factor. From this, the system keeps allowing worse and worse things every year. In the Electoral College, size and population of the states matter a lot. It can be unfair for a smaller state with a smaller population against a bigger state with a wider population. It is a winner-takes-all situation. Candidates don't spand that much time in states that they know they aren't going to win in. The electoral college is unfair and very outdated. We must adapt to the new demand of freedom of choice.

In short, it is better for a voter to know that their vote was counted towards something big. Maybe it was their vote that changed it all. We, as the United States of America, we have learned that our freedom is earned, not given. By this, it may take a while to convince those around that the Electoral College should be taken down or revised. We should get what we voted for because our voice counts .

I firmly believe that we should keep the Electoral College.  Many people say that it is ""outdated, irrational, and unfair"" but that is an opion.  Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is benificaial rather then destructive.  Out of these many reasons i am able to narrow it down to 2 reasons about why the Electoral College should be kept.  These reasons are Everyones President, and Swing States.

In Richard A. Posners' aritcle about keeping the Electoral College he talks about the President that is elected being everyones this President.  ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-reginal appeal.  No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""  This is not also a great example but it is a great counterclaim to Bradford Plumers article.  In PLumers article he states that, ""candiadtes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the the tight races in the ""swing"" states.  The Electoral College assures that the President isnt just wanted in one area that is wanted all around the country.  Electoral Colleges assure that the President is wanted in many differt parts of the United States.

""The electoral college invariably produces a clear winner,"" says Posner in his article.  A way of producing a clear winner is by having swing states.  Some people argue about the Electoral College turning off potential voters, (Democrats in Texas) but this may actually determine the election.  If those other party people dont vote who knows mabey if they had voted their party might have been luckly.  Statistics prove that when certaint parties win contriversial states thats because some people from 1 party didnt vote.  No voting especailly in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candiadate loose the election.  Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win.

The Electoral College is something that this country needs for our benifit.  It helps us Americas get a President that will benifit us all not just those in certaint areas.  Although some peopel dont think that the Electoral College is helping there are twice as many people who believe that just a popularity vote is a bad idea.  Having swing states, and having a way that finds ""everyones"" president are just few of the many exaples about why we need the Electoral College.

EFCE5EAB8414,"To the senator of our state,

The electoral college makes a big impact on our voting system. However, it needs to be changed or even abolished. The manner in which the eletoral college funtions is not fair to the public. By the time you've finished this letter I hope you'll have taken my suggestion to mind.

For one the electoral college makes voting feel unvalidated. It should be the public themselves that choose the president, not a signifigantly smaller group of people. This was the case in the 2000 election, when Al Gore was not elected even though he had a popular vote of 60 percent. This gives many people the mindset that if their votes will be overuled by the electoral college, then that gives them less of a motivation to vote.

This brings us to my next point. If the electoral college is abolished, than more people will want to vote. Now, the public's opinion is just as important as the college's in our current system, but there would most deffinately be a increase in the number of votes if this system was deystroyed. What drives people to vote in the first place is that they want their opinion to be heard, so the electoral college is preventing their opinions from being heard.

Another reason to abolish the electoral college is that I don't think that many people know it exists in the first place or at the very least know how it works. If more people were given the explanation from these articles, they would probably feel the same way; that their votes no longer mean anything by the time election day comes.

To conclude, the electoral college is an outdated concept in our federal system. It should be abolished so that the public will have a greater sense of purpose when they vote. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my suggestion.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FE477BD61B22,"United States of America, the land of the people right? When people think of America they think of freedom, so isn't it our job to keep it that way? With our electoral college, the people of America aren't truly given the right to where their vote matters. The electoral college has so many flaws such as the disaster factor, risk of a tie, and even how unfair it is to our countries voters.

The disaster factor is the risk that the electors could always defy the will of the people. The electors are picked by state legislatures, so it could easily happen where electors disobey the right citizens have and do what they choose, or the legislatures replace electors with malificent unpatriotic electors that will try to cheat the vote. How is that fair to us? Knowing that thousands and thousands of voters dedicate their time to focusing on which candidate is truly the most deserving, proactive, and thoughtfull. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...""

The Office of the Federal Register . Here was a time where had already been done, and it is sure to happen again.

Overall the electoral college is completely unfair with so many different problems that over rule the right of ther people. For example, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning...""

The Office of the Federal Register , this shows how it is not really fair to all the states as even if the popular vote comes close, the winning candidate takes all the electoral votes.

It is possible as well for the electoral votes to tie for both candidates, in which case if this were to happen it would be a catastrophe, as the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. ""...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from Calfornia, who represent 35 million voters""

The Office of the Federal Register . The population difference between the two is beyond comparable with California exceeding Wyoming with over 30 million voters. And to know that the two states would each get one vote? How is that, in any way possible, fair to American voters.

With so many problems with the electoral college and it being unimaginably unjust, the common thought would be how could this possibly still be the final word of our presidential election. If the Disaster factor, risk of a tie, and undoubting unfairness still haven't woken up our government, then how far and much destruction of our country's freedom will it take for the United States of America to truly be, the land of the people.

CEF86741E2C5,"The Electoral college has been around for a long time but, do we really need it? Is it your votes that affecting your next president. Under the electoral college it is not. The electoral college says that voters do no vote for the president but for a slate of the electors, which elect the presidents. We need to kept the voting process we have now so that way we don't arguments throughout the states. In the electoral college yoor vote is sent to someone not holding public office.

When you vote you are getting a slate of the vote and to feel that their vote does not matter, that the new president will have no regard for their interest,is he really your president. The way we vote today is not that best we can do in some ways. I think that we need to have all the voters votes count towards the president that they want. We should let the people vote for who they want and not for someone else to vote for you. The constituiton says ""We the people, By the people,For the people."" So we should vote for who we want to represent us. The electoral college is based of a winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates.

Another factor that is wrong with the electoral college is that bigger states like Californa get more votes than Columbia. So for example, say that Californa gets 45 electoral votes and then Columbia has the same amount of voters vote for the president they want they will only gte about 5 to 8 because of the state size. Once again restating that we need to vote for we want to and have everyone's vote coung not just the votes added up and then shrunk to electoral votes. The electoral college does have some help in some ways like in a run-off election. The electoral college help control that and produces a clear winner.

The elecoral college does some advantages too, but it still has disadvantges. The electoral college is  the president wins by popular vote. The electoral college has a total of 538 electors but, sometimes the electors don't always listen to their voters and vote for who they want not who the state wants. The president has their own group of electors which have been chosen by the canidate's political party, but certain state lwas vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The election is every four years on the first Tuesday of November, which gives you time to think who you want to be the next president and cast a vote, but with the electoral college your vote could not really count. Have knowing that your vote may not count will make you upset and rethink about voting.

In conclusion, the eletoral college has some good things that does help us but, it has bad things too that make is sadband angry. We decide who we want to run our country but, e need to think about how the voting process really works. I am only one person but, one person can make a difference.

I favor in keeping the Electoral College because it is a faster and reliable way of electing the president. For instinct, "" The Electoral College process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.""(Source 1) All the 538 electors that is part of the Electoral College represents millions of people. In order to count all the vote takes a long time so, the Electoral College is a faster way of electing the president.

The Electoral College has a certainty of outcome for who is going to be the president and vice preisdent. But, the electoral college has an invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. What that means is that, if the popular votes get 55% of your votes but, the electoral college get 62% of your votes. The votes from the popular votes and the electoral votes have different percentage. For this problem  you cant really predict what the Electoral College will elect.

The electoral college in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. Because of these states like Texas, Florida, California, New York, and other states that have large amounts of Electoral College; they are more likely to vote knowing that their votes are more important because of the winner-take-all method. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.""(Source3) This explains that the electoral college is a process that is relivent in keeping some power to the people.

The bad the thing about the electoral college is that the people dont vote for the president , but they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This process is not always fair because if you live in florida and you wanted to elect James but slate of 29 Democratic electors pledge to Don, so that means none Replubican electors pledge to James. This means your vote dont really effect the election. This problem is argued and complained with many people. The problem of a tie could happen too but the probility of that happening is not likely.

Overall, the electoral college is process that is fair in most terms.

I would love it if the electoral college was gone because it really is crazy if people are thinking their voting for someone when they really aren't like the presidents. We actually help pick our state senators because when we vote for presidents we are actually voting for the canidates electors. Some states have a winner takes all system, and what that system does is awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. But Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. after the prsidential election, our governor prepares a certificate of asertainment, l isting all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.

Under the electoral college system, we do not vote for presidents, but for the slate of electors who then elect the president.

Im sorry to say this but the electoral college is in fact, unfair and irrational.

It is unfair to voters and is one fo the things that make it even worst is what we call the "" Disaster Factor"". Its called disaster for a reason!

The electoral is very unfair to voters. When someone is voting for president, they do not want to be voting  for a slate of electors, I am pretty sure they want to be voting for who they think should represent them and their country. For example, if you lived in the state of Texas, and you wanted to vote for Jhon Kerry, you wouldnt be voting for him, but you would be voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. Suppose that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congresss and John Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are these electors? Who picks the electors anyways? ( stated in "" Whats wrong with the electoral college?"" )

There is apparently something called the ""Disaster Factor"" just because of the electoral college. As stated in the article, ""Whats wrong with the constitution?"", ""... American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worst.."" What if something worst happened, just like the 2000 fiasco?

Also, in 1960, Hawaii sent 2 slates of electors to congress (""Whats wrong with the electoral college"")

The Electoral College helps make the election more predictable. And yes we all know what happen to Al Gore in 2000 but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote (Richard A. Posner). This has happen it the 2012 election ""for example Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romeny because almost all states award electoral votes victory in that state""(Richard A. posner).

The Electoral College helps prevents the problem off elections that run-off. You see what happen is that when the ton runners tie the election gets very complicated. So the Electoral college produces a clear winner (Richard A Posmer). But it also can make the voters votes have no effect to the election. Which means that they would not have the push to care for the election anymore. Youhave to consider that if the Electoral College was not there that it would preety hard to select the winer of that tie.

Bigger states have more atention in that state than a small state like North Dakota would have in a presindental election.

I heartily agree that we the people should keep the Electroral College. Like you may already know, ""the ElectoralCcollege is a process, not a place."" Our founding fathers have made it, and as we look back into history, we realize that they were right about how a lot of things run in the U.S., so why should we question them now? Even we too as citizens know that they were right for making the Electoral College. As much as we aren't a citizen- ruled society, we aren't a totalitarian society either.

A really good reason for having the Electoral College is simply recognizefd by saying that it kind of gives us(the citizns of America) the ""power"" to vote for our president, rather than it being inherited, or voted upon solely by government officials, or some ranom process like in North Korea where Kim Jung Uun gets voted because he basically brainwashed his people into loving him. It gives us a certainty that we can chose the betterment for America. Also, though roughly half of the U.S. might agree, and the other half might disagree, you are entitled to your own opinion, and voting gives you the chance to show your opinion about whom you believe should be able to run our beatiful homeland as our trusted founding fathers once did, as presidnet.

I'm sure that it has come to you that their are, in fact, several great reasons for allowing the Electoral college still run, but their is a couple of downsides. First off, the people within the Electoral College that vote for us citizens, don't vote for each individual person, they vote based upon who is voted the most in their relative area in whichever state their in, so the people don't all get their votes out. This could have turned several presidential elctions around and helped the man or woman that lost in the election to win it.

66CB74DCDF61,"""Abolish the electoral college!"" is a famous statement that was made by Bob Dole on whether or not it would be a good idea to keep the electoral college. Though others may disagree and say that our founding fathers established the Electoral College. Also that it was established with the mindset of helping the American people, but i would like to think otherwise. I believe that the we should change the system by which we vote the president of the United States into election by popular vote. For many years we have been using the concept of the Electoral College and for many years, it has lead to unfair calls and the placing of bad leadership in our country.  In the article titled, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", the author defines what the electoral collage system really is, the author states, "" Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This system is an unfair system, and can not be trusted. It  time for change.

The electoral collage is a dishonesty to voters, it is an unfair system. In ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", the author makes a good claim. He or she talks about the winner takes all system that is affiliated with the electoral college. In the 13th paragraph the author specifically says, "" Because of the winner-take-all system in each tate, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races ""swing"" state."" That shows how unfair it is to us as the American people. Certain states may not get a chance to see who their choices are. They are forced to make a decision based on the little we know and the majority of the knowledge comes form the media which is a very unreliable source. "" During the2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all.""  That shows how little our voices are heard in a desion that is crutial for how we go about and make decisions in our everyday lives. We the American people have to rely on states such as Ohio for who our president will be.

There is dishonesty every where you go. More so in the electoral college. When the electors are chosen we have no say so. The state legislatures are the ones responsible for picking the electors. In paragraph 11 of ""The indefinsible Electoral College"", the author makes a remark that everyone should put into regards. It says ""That those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Just like people can lie about their age, electors san also fib about their position or party in which they are representing. The author also mentions in paragraph 11, : In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please.""Not everyone can be trusted, and the dishonesty is another reason why we should do away with the electoral college and change to election by popular vote. With the election by popular, we are assured that there is fair play even though some of us may not get our voice heard completely.

People who are for the concept of the electoral college may argue other wise. For instance, in the article called, ""In Defense of the Electoral College"", the author argues that "" The Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons"", meaning its idea of support. I believe the Electoral College is an overrated nor practical.

I am in favor of abolishing the electoral collage amd changing to election of by popular vote. With the system of election of popular vote, you will be sure that the system is fair,honest, and speakes the voices of the American people.

The Election System should be changed to popular vote. The Electoral College is unfair and irratinol. It should be cancelled, and be based upon popular vote with numbers that make since. Many votes have been barely won because the numbers are so close and high. The Electoral College Isn't an amount of how many people voted for a president, its for an elector. And you dont always pick your elector, it could get confused and a wrong elector could get picked.

Many states do not have a fair chance to vote, And one representitive can count as too many votes compared to their own value. Sates that didnt have the chance to see the canidates were most likely ignored wich dosent help because even if the people guessed a vote the electors would give out a large number of votes randomly to a canidate. Some staes didnt even get so see an ad for the canidates once.

""A single representitive from whyoming representing five hundred thousand representitives would have as much to say as fifty five representitives from California, who represnt thirty five million voters.""  "" During the 2000 campaign seventeen states didnt get to see the canidates at all,Including rhode island and south carolinia, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad.""

These qoutes from bradford plumber, explain that half of the peoples votes were going to wrong canidates as the pepole were completley confused about who they were even voting for. They didnt even get Ads that could give them at least a look or a hint, basically, the people were clueless. It even seems a little unorganized, the Electoral College dosent make much since either based on the information given, but what you should really think about is how the Electoral College has hint of trying to cheat its way into electing a canidate.

In addition, The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over.

EC29A4F154B1,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College has a negative impact on this country because it has ufair voting that can cause massive problems to the government. Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. People should have the right to vote on which president they think is fit to run this country. People are hardly know which elector they are voting on.

We shouldn't vote for electors that we don't know. Elections should be held by popular vote because Elector Colleges have a unfair advantage since there vote counts not ours. According to the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradfor Plumer states, ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" The fact that the Congress has unfaithul electors that are supposed to be supporting whomever candidate they choose is a massive unfair problem. Popular votes and Electors votes are the complete opposite. For instance, accroding to the article ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner states, ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral voters, but that was the first time since 1888.""This is unfair and confusing because the electors shouldn't be deciding on what candidate should win. The peoples vote should conclude which candidate is going to win.

Since the first Electoral college was created it has been the same eversince. It is majorly outdated and has to be solved now. According to the article :What is the Electoral College?"" by the office of the Federal Register it states, ""The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""There is suppose to be vote from the congress and a vote from the population. I think that the congress should be part of the voting that all the qualified citizens are in. There shouldn't be two different parts of voting because it will confuse who is the winner.

The government should have a voting system that is both equally fair and decisive because right now everything is mixed up and it will bring great problems to the campains. More and more people will want to stop voting because they do not trust the electors on there decisions. This will cause a great decrease on voters which will impact the populations vote on which President is the winner. According to the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradfor Plumer states, ""the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Those electors could always defy the will of the people."" A solution must be done to prevent any more disasters that can be on there way.

In conclusion, Electoral colleges have a unfair system that could cause negative problems to voting and to the elections. The elections will be confusin and unproffesional. But the government and the people of America can help by changing this and will approve a fair decisive system were all citizens get to choose which president shall win not the type of electors.

25CBD2584EB7,"I think that we should change to popular vote for president of the United States. Instead of the Electorial College. I think this for a lot of reasons, one is because you dont vote for the president but for the electors. It is unfair because they have a winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to decide. Electers can defy the will of the people. The electorial college should be changed to popular vote for the president.

First, you have to vote for the electors not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can't even control who the electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong elector. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.

Then, they have the winner takes all system. Also candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even see a campain ad. Though they established electorial college in the constituition Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, agreed on abolishing the electorial college.

Lastly, electers can defy the will of the people. The state legislatures are resposible for picking the electors. If there is a tie between the electors then the state gets to decide. Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate he then validated only his opponent's electors. He made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if this possibly happens again?

The electorial college should be changed to popular vote for the president. This should be done because the electorial college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. You also dont vote for the president you vote for the electors. Its also unfair because of the winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to vote for the president.

B2EE7ADD5BFA,"Dear senator,

I have done research and I would like to change the Electoral College to the popular vote for the President of the United States. Source 1: ""What is electoral College?"" explains that ""each canadate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" Many people do not know what that really means. It means that the people of the United States do not actually vote for who their president will be. They are voting for someone who gets to choose who the president will be. Having the Electoral College is very confusing. I think it is more fair to have the people of the United States vote directly for their president instead of voting for a slate of electios that then choose the president.

By getting rid of the Electoral College, the vote for the United States president will be more fair. We, the people of the United States, would not be voting for a slate of electors. We would actually be voting for who we want to become our president. These votes would be more direct and accurate.

Source 2: ""Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states that voters may get confused and vote for someone that they didnt want to vote for. The people should be the ones voting for their president. It is unfair that only the electors get to vote in the end. Voters of the electors cannot even control who the electors vote for. The people have to put their trust in the electors to vote for the president. It make smore sense for the people to have a say and for them to have the ability to vote directly.

When I turn eighteen and I am allowed to vote, I hope that my vote actually matters. I hope that my vote does not just go towards an elector. I hope that my vote will count towards whom I think will represent our country well.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D4375D1ECD7D,"The Electoral College is an important process of voting in the president. Many citizens believe that it should not exist and the president should be voted in by popular vote. It's not that simple.

Without the Electoral College, the president might not be thoughtfully voted in. The Electoral College exists for the congress to decide who becomes president and vice president. In the society we live in today, many of the young are voting for who promises stuff that they care about, but not the candidate who is the most qualified and truthful. Congress examines all the information and chooses who would represent the United States the best and who would run the country with an iron first and improve the nation.

If Congress didn't use the Electoral College system, the nation could go corrupt. The ""popular vote"" could be only by a few votes, and the other half of the nation could get extreamly angry and rebel in protest. This could possible start another civil war. By keeping the Electoral College, this would not happen. The country votes, and that counts a little towards the new president. Otherwise, the country is satisfied with the Electoral College system and is used to it by now so won't get upset if who they voted for isnt chosen. Congress, who carefully reviews each candidate, chooses who is the most qualified and votes. Depending on the population of each state, the sentors and representatives get to vote too.

The Electoral College system has been part of the United States voting system since the Constitution was signed, and should stay as our main system of voting to keep this country as it originally was and true to its meaning. This is the most effective way of choosing the best candadite for keeping our nation united and strong.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The first reason is because, all you need to get is 270 votes just to win the whole thing.

Pluse that shoulldnt be right beacsue that person knows everyone that lives in the town and they might not know that the other person is way much better then the person that  they knew for many years.

1515B6404750,"The Electoral College is a process that the founding fathers founded. It is a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and a polular vote of qualified citizens for the president, as stated in line 1.

The Electoral Cellege consists of 538 electors. To be elected president, 270 electoral votes is required. Each candidate running for president has their own group of electors. After the president is elected, your governor lists all the candidates and the names of their representive electors that ran for office.

The Certificate of Ascertainment declares the winning candidate from your state and shows which electors will be representing him or her at the December of the election year. All this information is sent to the Congress and National archieves as a part of official records.

Many times, people voting for a candidate get confused on who they are voting for, and often get confused. This is do the the electors being chosen by anyone. when selecting them, there are no set rules.

Many people do not agree with the Electoral college vote, as it says on line 11. The smaller states think they should have just as many votes as the bigger states, but that defeats the whole purpose of the Electoral Votes.

As it says on line 19, Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have Trans-Regional appeal. In other words, no region can single handedly put a president in office. There would need to be two thirds vote to win.

Our founding fathers feared democracy, and the is why they came up with this process. If we used democracy, only 51% of voters would be needed. But with Electoral Votes, it keeps little states from having too much power and say.

People think that their vote does not matter, because they are voting for the state, not the country. Many people think like this, and choose not to vote, but really every vote matters. People also tend to not vote because tey do not agree with the Electoral College, but why not try to make a difference and put the man you want in office in control?                    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College consits of electoral votes that each states recieves due to the population of the state. This gives larger states like California having 55 electoral votes to have a bigger say in the election. Meanwhile states with a less population rate like Alaska only have 3 electoral votes. This turns off voters because they know that their state isn't a big deal in a election. Candidates go for the electoral votes of the bigger states with the most population to win the election.

The Electoral College is a method that is unfair to voters. The winner take all system in each states makes candidates or even voters not want to spend their time on current states they know will not have a impact in the election.

Its unfair to voters because of the winner take all system candidates dont spend time in state they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the states.

Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. The electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, a non democratic method of picking a president that will to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.

0F6250B6D784,"Dear state senator,

The Electoral College that was established by the founding fathers in the Contitution is important to all of us. Every candidate that is running for President in each state has its own group of electors that the political party of the candidate chose. I am however, not in favor of keeping the Electoral College but to change it to be an election by popular vote for the president of the United States, the reason being that it is unfair to the voters and outdated.

The Electoral College is unfair to it's voters. If the candidate has more electoral votes than popular votes then they have a higher chance of winning. ""Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prewfer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer, Paragraph 9). The president is the leader of the United States and if most of our country votes on a candidate they think suites the best but the other candidate wins, that would make many voters dissapointed. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"" (Plumer, Paragraph 13). Every vote counts, and the candidate that gets the most popular votes deserves the win.

Since our founding fathers established the Electoral College it shows that it is outdated. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer, Paragraph 14). This is the twenty-first century, and we need to make our elections more modernized to where every voter is happy. A voter should not vote for an elector and hope that the candidate wins but be able to vote for the candidate itself. Even though there are many people against the Electoral College, it still has its defenders. ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency"" (Plumer, Paragraph 9). As there are people who believe that whatever our founding fathers established we need to keep our tradition going and not change a single thing, but maybe it's time for a change. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than poeple who thing that single vote may decide an election"" (Posner, Paragraph 23).

""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college"" (Plumer, Paragraph 14)! The voters think the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. People vote for a candidate but the outcome is not what they were expecting. The candidates that get the most popular votes deserve to win!

A06C5A94FBCD,"Dear Senator,

If one could sum up the definition of the Electoral College in a few words, those words would be unessasary and room for error. The Electoral College was established by our fore fathers in the constution. Paragraph one in What is the Electoral College by the Office of the Federal Register states ""A compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" It is more than possible that a change in our voting system could better america in all kinds of ways.

I believe that the electoral College takes away the peoples opinion in a way just descreet enough to still call it a democracy. The people still vote and determine the overall outcome of the election, But with an electoral college, there is more then enough room for error. One argument aganist the Electoral College is in the very purpose of the system. The people votes go to an electors slate that share the same view as you, then they vote for a candidate. This is opposed to the peoples vote going directly to the candidate. This method of voting is if not purposeless then problematic. Electors can betrey your trust and vote for the opposite canadidate. A statement from Brandford Plumers' The Indefensible Electoral College says ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.""

In America our society is based off of freedom and the electoral college is not promoting it. Please keep in mind that the legislature is nearly compleatly responsable for choosing our electors. At any election they could defy the peoples choice. Excerp from The Indefensible Electoral states ""back in 1960, segregationists in the louisana legislature neary succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" Electors have occasinally been know for simply refusing to vote for their party's candidate. If this is freedom to vote then there undoubtingly needs to be a change in the near future.

Scandles like the one thay occured in 1960 rarely happen, but whos to say that it could not happen in the future. Our presidental election is practically based off of trust in our goverment. The Electoral college does reconize voters from each region of the county but due to the way the system is set up, it does a poor job interpreting the votes of the people.

A quote from In Defence of the Electoral College by Richard A. Posner states ""It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popluar vote"" This happened as recently as the election of 2000 Then ask yourself what would really be the harm of ingoring the Electoral College. It only would make the outcome clearer.

The American elections differ from most countrys in the way that we are a democrecy. we the people can vote. we the people have individual voices that are the composition of the country. The elector college does not oppose this. But rather is opening the doors for coruption. Taking away the Electoral College and replacing it with popular vote, is simply clarifying the peoples decisions, and the peoples decisions is nothing less then America itself.                                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
B9FFF4311016,"In the matter of the electoral college, being either abolished or kept intact, i take the side of keeping it intact for the reason that even though you are technically not voting for the president, but for a slate of delegates that are loyal to the candidate, it is in fact very useful. First, the number of electoral votes are given by the population of each state, and second, there is a near certanty of a outcome because of the winner take all system.

To begin with, the electoral college is based on the population of the state, meaning, that the bigger the state population, the more electoral college represantitives they get. So, if California has the biggest population in the U.S, and the district of Columbia has the smallest, then it isn't fair that they get the same number of votes, either small nor large, because there are more people in one state then the other. Although people say that the electoral college is a bad thing, and think that it is an anarchism, it is not, for it is one of the things that keep our counntry in near perfect shape.

Another reason that the Electoral College should be kept, is that there is a near certainty of a outcome. Take the 2012 election between Obama and Romney, where Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to the 51.3% populatrity vote cast to him. People argue that the electora l college has a diaster factor, or that the system allows for much more to happen that doesn't. Thats the problem. It hasn't happened and most likely won't happen, because if were going to happen then it would've already happened and Congress wouldve revised it and made sure that it didnt happen or that it could be delayed so that a solution was made possible, and that the election went as continued.

To conclude, even though the electoral college has many flaws that are yet to be shown and or fixed, it is the only way we have to elect presidents, and thats how it should be, because you can't have a perfect thing without flaws that have to be fixed    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

First of all, Popularity voting should be the way we vote because it's constitutional. Abraham Lincoln once stated that ""this is a nation for the people, by the people, and from the people""; its part of the constitution. Also, this is one nation under god and the almighty father believes in fairness; wouldn't you agree the people deserve a say so? Popularity voting allows the people to show what they support instead of electorals not serving the people justice. Electoral voting allows segergation because some states don't get a say so, but the question is aren't we one nation? The constitution says all men are equal;so what makes a man in California better than a man in North Carolina? So that's one strike for electoral voting.

Furthermore, popularity voting gives little states a say so. Did you know that small states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and other 15 states sometimes don't get to see candidates? It's unfair that electoral voting only aims for states with high electoral voting. Popularity voting will change that giving little states a say so will heighten the ratio and maybe change the outcome. Popularity voting allows small states to put their opinion in on who they want as president because they are part of the country as well. Electoral treats smalll states like they don't matter and it's time to change that; Electoral voting now has two strikes.

Finally, popularity voting is just fair. Everyone born in America was born into the land of the free, land of the equal, land of the brave, so why shouldn't voting be like that? Everyone deserves the right to pick who they want to represent them, and if not its abusing their rights. Popularity voting is the clear choice because electoral voting is unfair, they obstrain your rights and your freedom of speech; you deserve to say who you want in office. They rather put you on mute and say you don't matter; we have to stand up. Electoral voting that was your last straw.

In conclusion, America should have popularity voting because electoral voting is unconstitutional, it doesn't give little states a say so and it's plain unfair. Also popularity voting is now the most popular voting style. We as Americans are tired of being treated unfairly and we are sticking to our national slogan; three strikes your out so good-bye electoral voting.

05BE83E193CF,"Dear state senator , i strongly believe in keeping the electoral college to be in chare of the way the elections would proceed instead of changing the outcome of elections to popular vote because voters may not believe in what the candidate's intentions for the people but may like the candidate, it is more organized , and the people would be pleased with the outcome.

The electoral college is a great way of proceeding with elections because changing the way our election system is to one of popularity voting would not be wise because voters may not believe in what the candidate's intentions are for the people but they may like the candidate. There is more of a certainty when the electoral college is in charge for example when Obama was running against Romney he only received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to the 51.3% percent of the popular votes that have been casted for both him and Romney but because of the majority percentage of electoral votes that were casted in his favor.

The electoral college is more organized than a popular vote because if a voter has voted for example Obama for the electoral vote but voted for Romney for the popular vote it would be unorganized because of the split vote between popular and electoral which is recquired the majority of when in a public govermental election which could impact the whole future for the nation. The election for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 they both had only a 43 percentage plurality of popular votes while also winning a majority in the electoral college which was (301 and 370 electoral votes) . When no candidate fully wins the majority of the votes that were casted they wouldn't have to recount the votes of have a re-election which would drain the economies money because of the high amount of money put into one election in the first place just to have another election, whereas the electoral college can just step in and rectify the situation just by producing a clear winner on their own instead of going through a long process just to find out who the clear winner is all they have to do is debate among themselves who they believe the people would be happy with in the long run .

Electoral college is the best way because in the long run the people would be pleased with the outcome that they have voted for because if it was turned into a popular vote election people who voted for a specific president wouldn't have won just because they aren't popular amongst the people that are voters iin that year's election . However the popular vote election may also be a good idea because if the voters cast a vote for you in the  popular election that should essentially like your intentions that would benefit the countries needs and demands that are recquired for us in the long run.

Therefore the electoral college should stay in charge of all decsions having to do with the elections for new presidencey when the time time comes because if it was changed to popular vote people would vote for the candidate that they like the best instead of the candidate with the best intentions for the nation, it is considerably more organized than a popular vote election , and the people would be end up being pleased with the outcome in the long run.

D58890A4F68C,"Dear Senator,

We the people, of the United States of America..... These are the first words written upon the Declaration of Independence. This is our very earliest document showing our democratic tendencies, and how we act as one. It also shows how we make decisions among ourselves as a people, as opposed to having other make decisions for us. This leads me to what I wish to discuss with you. Others do not vote for us. We vote for ourselves. We decide who leads us, who will help us get to a better place, who will decide what to do about the national debt, who will pass laws concerning immigrants and the minimum wage. We do. Not you, not the House of Represenatives, and most certainly not the Electoral College. Which is why there should be no Electoral College.

The Electoral College is a group of people whom elect the president(2). How many for each candiate there are is decided by us, the voters. But heres the thing- most voters think they're voting for the president. They dont even know what they're voting for! And even if some do, its easy to get confused and accidentally vote for the wrong candiate(10). While one vote may not skew the entire election, a couple thousand can.

Many who support the Electoral College will say that voting by popular vote is a bad idea becuase of the possibility of a tie(18). But in reality, it is just as easy to tie in the Electoral College. Its happened recently too, in 1888 and again in 2000(18).

This isn't the only thing thats broken about the Electoral College. The possibility that a president could win by popular vote, but lose the campaign due to the electoral vote is filthy. It is unfair to the people, and far from democratic. The Electoral College is an anachronism(15). It reminds me of the Roman Republic really, and we are not romans, and this is not a republic. Or, at least, its not supposed to be.

Something else that is unfair to the people. Due to the Electoral College canaditates only focus on large states, or swing states(13). Voters in small states, such as Wyoming, will never see the candiates and may see only one or two camaign ads. They can't get to know the candidates and make an informed decision. And even in the regional states, democrats should always be trying to convert republicans to their side and vice versa. But becuase of the large swing states, this rarely happens.

The possibilty of corruption among the Electoral College, is also a present danger. I'm sure you remember form history class how party bosses took advantage of naive immigrants. I can imagine republican electors being paid off or threatened so that they vote democrat. Can you really trust the electors?

According to a poll in 2000, 60% of people want to activate a popular vote system. Popular soverignty worked well for awhile when it came to the topic of slavery, why won't it work for us now? And why would anyone want such an outdated system like the Electoral College in place? Think upon my words Mr. Senator. The Electoral College needs to end.

Sincerely,

5813B9B1A1C0,"In my opinion I believe change the election to popular vote because it is better for the citizens and all of the people. And doing the popular votes is better to do because it gives everyone a chance to vote for who they want to support for their president.

The Electoral College may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying there state, knowing their vote will have no effect at all, they will tend to have less incentive to pay attention to the campaihn than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So thats not far to every state.

The Electoral College is mostly regared as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that out to be overuled by declaring the cadidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. The electoral College is totally unfair to the people who want to vote for president and outdated. The best arguments based on reality. Onlu 270 people have to voke to elect the president and thats crazy because they could all gang up and be told to chose only one person and thats unfair to the other person running for president. The best argument against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century the system really calls for much worse.

The electoal college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know have a chance of winning. Just during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaigm ad. When you think you are voting for a president candiate you are actully voting for a slate of electors, so you end up getting betrayed by the system            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D545B7CB039D,"Dear. Mr. President,

I feel that we should change the Electoral collage to a direct vote. As the author states in source 2 ""Under the Electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors.."" I believe the people should have a better say in who gets to run the USA. We should aboilish the electoral collage because people need to be able to vote for the president himself not his slate of electors. Also some electors don`t actually vote for who they are representing, And the electoral collage is just not fair.

The people should have a better say in who their president gets to be. They shouldn`t be voting for the Slate electors, but should be voting for the president. Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states. That`s just not right at all.

Belive it or not some of the electors dont even vote for the president they are representing. It doesn`t make any sense to do that. The electors should be voting for who they represent. That just increases my points value. The people should be able to vote for who they want.

The electoral collage is just unfair. The state legislators pick the electors, and some of those electors could always defy the qill of the people. It is unfair to the voters mainly because of the winner take all system, They mainly only focus on the swing states. Sometimes people get confused about the electors anf vote for the wrong canidate.

Many people can`t figure out if they want to get rid of the Electoral collage are keep it in place. The Electoral collage should be gotten rid of because the people should have a say, and some elecotrs are not loyal and can go agaisnt the will of the people. In the wise words of Bob Dole ""Abolish the electoral collage!""    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D6D4A77F4AAA,"Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and she/he got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College.

Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President.

Remember the election between Obama and Romney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winner-take-all"" basis. For every slight of pulrality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoral-vote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College.

Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election.

If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If he/she got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making him/her the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.

AF1C86BFDC2D,"I think that we should change the voting system from the Electoral college to the most popular vote. Let me tell you why I think we should.

The first reason is that it is unfair to voters and presidential nominees. If the voters can not get there votes in to the nominee that they want then how do the votes go to the right elector. For example,the winner take all system,presidential nominees go to the states that they know they have a chance of getting there votes from. A few states never saw a campaign ad such as Rhode island and south Carolina,voters from 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

The second reason is that most voters only vote if they they like him or her on the way he or she dresses,talks,looks like,race,etc. Real voters now what they are doing and know who is really better for the country on his or hers facts and statistics. Some people just don't know who they should really vote for but that's what makes the country bad off. For example,people could vote for a president who says to lower minimum wage so so the higher paid people get paid more but he or she don't tell you about cutting down the minimum wage to $5.00 and then the people who voted for the good nominee and get paid minimum wage are now getting paid less but really the other nominee is the good one.

The third reason is that even Richard Nixon,Jimmy carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of commerce,and the AFL-CIO all agreed on abolishing the electoral system. Almost every one has agreed on abolishing the electoral system. But there needs to be more people with higher grounds and words to abolish the system.

In conclusion the electoral college has no really good side to it. Its unfair,outdated and irrational. Almost everyone says to get rid of it. If you want it gone your gonna have talk to someone of high authority.              ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
86BB3D5BA612,"Dear State Senator, I send you this letter to bring up an issue that is often debated amongst us Americans. Should we kee the Electoral College? No! The electoral college just doesn't work anymore and we have seen that in the past. You probably ask yourself what is wrong with the Electoral College? The problem with the Electoral College is that it is unfair, it doesn't rely on what the people say and it can sometimes really make the public mad.

The Electoral College is really unfair, especially for voters. We vote for who WE want, not for some other guy to say what we want. Voters want THEIR voice to be heard when they vote not someone else's. When we vote for a presidential candidate we want to vote directly for who we are voting, we want to pick who we want directly. In source 2 the article explains how the Electoral College works. The author says ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What this means is that when you voted for Obama you didn't vote for Obama , you voted for a group of people to vote for who they wanted. So your voice was not heard. Don't you find that unfair to the voters and to the candidates?

Everytime one person votes for a certain presidential candidate, they are basically ignored. The President should be chosen by the people! And at the moment the President is being chosen by politicians who will ""represent"" us and repeat what we say although that has been proven to not always be true. Passage 2 reminds us of the incidence in the 2000 election in which Al Gore lost the presidency to George W. Bush by electoral votes, even though he had more inividual votes. This proves that our state representatives will not always represent us how we want them to, but how they want to represent us. This is the reason why voters need a direct voice from them to picking their leaders. We should pick what we want not what some politicians want. You are probably saying that these incedents do not happen very often, as said in source 3. The article says ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000...but that was the first time since 1888"" This says that situations like this are very rare, yet it is still possible. Even so, wouldn't you rather the people be heard rather than a politician that claims to represent his state?

So many people got mad in 2000 when they just chose the president most people didn't want. There's many ways to make us Americans mad and this is just another one of those ways. In the United States you are supposed to be able to choose what you believe to be right. If you want to choose what you think should be the future's right president then you should be able to pick him and not have to expect anyone's approval or opinion on your vote. You should be able to walk out from the voting center and say

I voted for this guy. Eventually keeping the Electoral College will only cause more problems, because as time goes on the human develops its opinion futher and creates and spreads new ideas meaning that there will be more people picking different things. If you think that what you are picking should be picked you should be able to say ""I want that"" and not have to through the bother knowing that a politician may have chosen what you DON'T want. If you want to make Americans mad, then keep the Electoral College.

In conclusion I think that the Electoral College be removed and the use of popular vote be put into effect because the Electoral College is unfair, it does not reply on what the public says and it makes the Americans mad. Please take this letter into consideration.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F2B0AA10A7C9,"Dear senator of Florida,

In my opinion of the Electoral College, I think we should keep it. Many people would most likely say I am wrong to think that way or I am just a kid and I have no idea what I am discussing, but I really think we should even though it has some flaws, here is my three reasons why.

First, it was established by our founding fathers. The ones who fought in battle against Britan. They sacerficed their lives to get us where we are today. Its not just a law, its what connects us to our ancestors and its what makes us unique from most nations voting systems today and back then.

Second, Though most will complain that we are not actually voting for president, but that we are putting our time and effort into voting for a slate of electors who then vote for president. Even though there is no rule against them not voting for the president of your choosing, most of them will vote for him since they are on his team and have pleged themselves to him. So really there is a very high chance of them voting for the president you want. I say they have done a very good job for such a stressing carrier.

Third, It has been going good so far. There are'nt wars taking place outside our homes like in some countries. Our Republican and Democratic parties are gracious in victory or humble in defeat. Yes there are some flaws in the system but thats just human nature. None of us are perfect and we never will be. We will make mistakes and we just got to live with them because there going to happen whether we like it or not.

This is my three major reasons why I think we should keep the Electoral College. I hope you found them intresting and will take the words to heart. Please dont tred on the fact that I am just a teen, but that there is a teen out there that actually cares about our nations future and government.

The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Why do the state of senator wish to take away electoral college votes? because they think there is to much voting bc under the electoral college system voters vote not just for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. but who pick the electors? who are the electors? the electors can be anyone that not holding public officean they pick the electors by the state. that how voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote. But the outcome of all this is that electoral college vite is possible an its less likely to dispute over the popular vote. A electoral vote is possible because the total number of vites is 538 is an even number. So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. so state senator i think we should keep the electoral college.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FE91D719ADAC,"Dear State Senator,

We should stop using the Electoral College and change to popular vote.  It's unfair that we aren't actually voting on the president we want and that it goes by what the electors want.  Popular vote is fair because we the voters pick what we want.

Is the Electoral College a good system?  I think not, I mean it's no where near fair.  The electors vote on who they want not what the people want.  Everyone wants to be able to pick who they want for president and not have their vote be wasted on a couple of old dudes who don't think the way we do.

Popolar vote is better.  The people go vote who they want and the only reason the person they voted for doesn't win it's because he wasn't as popular as the other canidate.  Our president should be elected because the people of United States of America chose them.  Why would we leave are votes to the hands of electors?  We shouldn't.     ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
BF2D36E0B64B,"Although numerous amounts of people want to banish the Electoral College, there are more rights than wrongs about it. The Electoral College is in the Constitution for an enormous reason; it is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and popular vote of qualified citizens. This process allows for the people of the nation to have a say and for the elected people of each state to speak even louder for their state. The Electoral College is despised, yet it is the smartest way on how to elect the President.

The Electoral College requires for a president to have trans-regional appeal. For example, Romney was a solid favorite in the South, but he cannot win with only the votes from the South because no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. While Romney did not have to campaign much for the South, he had to campaign very heavily in the North to increase his chances of election in those states. This is an amazing result because the people want a president that is liked throughout the nation, so while he is president he can be a hugely successful one. Canidates mainly focus on swing states, and dont have a lot of time for states they know they are going to win or lose; however, voters in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing they are the ones to decide the election. These voters in swing states are averagely the most thoughtful voters, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College should be kept because it almost always goes in favor of the people. Even though in the 2000 election Al Gore got the popular vote but George W. Busch won the electoral votes, that has not happened since 1888! The party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Many people want to change the election for the President to popular vote, but it would be more likely to have a dispute over the popular vote than in the elctoral college. Also, there could be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the total number of votes is an even number, but it is tremendously unlikely given that there has never been a tie. Also, the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the voter's cast.

The Electoral College can be argued to repel potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state, for example, republicans in California; on the other hand, every voter's vote plays a big part to their state's electoral vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The Electoral College has worked for more than a century and will keep on working if the people of the nation agree to work with it.                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think that we should change over to election by popular vote. I thinks that because in the Electoral College the voters dont vote on the president, but instead they vote on the electors who then vote for the president. ""It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense....it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. There are five reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are preactical, not liberal or conservative reasons. Some people disagree though they think that we should stick with the electoral college. They think its a good way to do the voting because they get to choose the electors who will choose our president.

The electoral college is definitely the best way to pick a candidate without much confusion. The electoral college may have some down falls too but the benefits out weigh them.

A popular vote also has some benefits. In Richard A. Posner's passage

In Defence of the Electoral College he states,""The electoral college is not a democratic method it is the electors who elect the president not the people""(source 3 p15). If this was our voting method the people would be choosing the president, not the electors. Plus the people dont even know the electors their voting for. In the passage

The Indefensible Electoral College author Bradford Plumer states,""The state picks the electors [and the voters dont even get to pick who the electors vote for]"" (source 2 p 10). Basically the people have no control over who they elect.

Indeed there maybe limited control for the people over voting for their canidate;but the electors usually pick whoever the people voted for. The electoral college also is a easier way to decide who wins the election. Theres almost no way there can be a tie in an elctoral vote. Richard A.Posner states,""The winning canidates share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the poplular vote"".""[Even if the popular vote winner wins by a little he wins all the electoral votes]""(source 3 p 15).Which means there is no confusion as to who wins.

Not only is the electoral college more organized; but it makes the president have to appeal to many regions of people. Richard A. Posner states,""[Not one region has enough votes to win an election so the president has to be liked by other regions as well]""(source 3 p 19).This means that at least half the country must like the candidate for him to win. Swing states are also important in the electoral college. These states are the ones that really care and study who will be the best president. Another statement from Richard A.Posner states,""[People in swing states decide the election and] are the most thoughtful voters""(source 3 p 20).So the candidate must be trying to make sure they please the people.

The people may like a popular vote the best,but the most organized and beneficial way to elect canidates is through electoral college. The electoral college not helps with organizing it helps people know the candidate. They know the candidate because the candidate must go to each region and get to know the people.

F320A6767646,"Dear Senator of my State,

Being a citizen of the state of Florida, I dearly wish for the Electoral College voting to no longer continue.

In my state of opinion, we should change the election of voting to the most popular vote for the President of the

United States. I have thought through for awhile that the Electoral College is rather dumb. But of course

I cant just say that and think you will get rid of it, i have to have my reasons of why i think this and share them with you.

First off, when we want citizens to vote, such as my self, we want all of thier votes to count for something.

Not just some little game for you senators to play with. All of our voting need to be included by what we voted in the first place and what we want, thats the whole point of voting. For example, we dont always control whom our electors vote for, that's unfair. Or even worse, we get confused about the electors and sometimes vote for the wrong candidate. Citizens that are voting for a candidate should never be confused on who they vote for. So if i was a State Senator i would stop the Electoral College for good.

There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree. I would state them all but unfortunatly i am running out of time. Just know that i think that the Electoral College is unhealthy and is wrong for our society and it is completly an anachronism. Its NOT hard to say but Bob Dole was right, "" Abolish the electoral college! "" .                                                ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
088C3E8EBAE7,"Dear state senator,

I write to argue in favor of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source ""widely regarded as an anchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner."" That was in my opinion pretty self explanatory. This letter is based on information from article sourses I read.

First of all, I would like to start by saying that the Electoral College is helpful to avoid problems where no candidate got a majority. For example in the 5th part of the source 3 it says ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both  had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)"" which backs up my claim. I understand the ""wrong"" part of it like in the 2nd source it says ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. Honestly I dont see it as that ""wrong"" but thats my opinion.

Second, I agree with the Electoral College despite the lack of ""democratic pedigree"" for five reasons. First, ""Certainty of Outcome"" meanning winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote, example, Obama vs Romney. Second, in the Everyone's President part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, ""Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"". Number 3, ""Swing States"" the ""winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"". There is also number 4 where the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" amnd there is number 5, ""Avoid Run-Off Elections"" which is what I used in the second paragraph as a claim.

In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it. Well thank you for taking the time to read through this.     ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I believe that rather than having the

Electoral College , we should have elections by popular vote. A popular vote can be a better source of election because it gives the people of the state a better chance to express themselves and have a free, independant country.

The process of the Electoral College consists of a meeting of five hundred-thirty eight selected electors, where they vote for the President and Vice President. This situation can be considered unfair to many people that do not get selected as electors because there opinion is not put into consideration. It is said that over sixty percent of voters would perfer a direct election verses the Electoral College. This statistic goes to show that people do not feel that they are involved in our country. How can you consider this a free and independant nation if we do not all get the privelage to vote?

F25A34210445,"Presidents, they are the most powerful people in the United States of America. They are the people who make the tough calls for the masses to make sure the benifits of the majority are met because the needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few. Some people think that the way our presidents are elected today are not very practicle methods but some people do. Presidents are elected using two processes, those processes are popular vote and Electoral College. The Electoral College is not very practical in my book because they don't spend time in the places that they know they are going to win or not going to and Electoral College is not by majority.

Presidents are like superstars of the political world but they don't spend any time in the places they are know they will win or lose. Source 2 states ""Candidates dont spend the time in states they know they have no chance  of winning."" The candidates for the presidential election don""t even try to sway some of the states that either they know aren't going to vote for them or the opponent has already been there and gave them his idea on cetain matters. Voters are usally more thoughtful when they dont know who to vote for so the listen to both sides, but there is also the problem of majority in some places and not others.

Majority also plays an impact on the vote of the presidency. Look at how many Electoral College votes California has, they have a total of 55 votes thats more than Wyoming by a land slide because Wyoming only has 3 votes total. If one side got Florida, Califronia, Texas and Massachusetts then the opposing side would have to get all of the other states just to catch up. The distrabution of the votes is a problem because some states are humongus but they dont have a large population. Some states are really shrimpy but have a abundance of people. These are just two reasons why the Electoral College process should be tossed out of the election decisions in general.

Some people say the Electoral College process is just fine because this process aviods run off elections. Source 3 states ""Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies the majority of the votes cast."" They say this because of what happened in the Nixon and Clinton race in 1992. Neither one of them got the majority the both got 43 precent of the votes cast. This doesn't help the real problems at hand like the time management and majority issues in the states that have large amounts of people and little land and vis versa. The amount of votes each state gets is based on its population and its not fair to the staets that have less people just because of there location to suffer while the smaller more populos states don't.

In future election the Electoral College should be taken out of the process in which the president is elected because of the miss use of time and the distribution of population. The popular vote process would eliminate both problems if it was the only process. It would eliminate the time spent in states by making them go to every single one or close to that. They would do this to make sure they got as many votes as possible. It would also eliminate the population aspect because every state would get to make a diffrence in the election of the president instead of having 3 votes and most of the other states having twice that or more. This election process is to complicated you should dumb it down or simplify it to increase the impact of each state and the simplfication for the soon to be president. We don't want him to change his mind about doing this important job for us as a country.                  ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
27681E4EB137,"There have been many discussions whether or not having an electoral college as the system to decide the president is alright. Many people say this system is corrupted and that it must be thrown out to think of a new better government system, while many other people disagree and state that ""yes"", this system works perfectly well and that we should keep it this way for many years. Of course, most of the population of the country simply believe this system is best and we should keep it. This may be because certainty of the outcome, and because the system is made out well. Of course, there is also a downside to this such as when a person goes to vote, their not neccesarily voting for whom they believe to be voting for.

To begin with, having the electoral college is great because of the fact that there is certainty of the outcome. As said in source 3 by Richard A. Posner, there is absolute certainty of the person you're voting for is going to win or lose. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Useing this as an example explains that the electoral college, to win it, you must need the magority votes.

Furthermore, the system it self is made out really well. As said in source 1, the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors [ which consists of 538 and only takes 270 electoral votes to elect a president]. During this meeting they vote for who they want as president and vice president. Also, your state's entitiled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. In a way you could say that, the electoral college is like a game, and many people just want it gone because they aren't good at it, or just don't understand it.

Of course there is always a downside to everything. This flaw is that, when you're voting, you're not voting for who you believe you are voting for. As said in source 2, when you vote for your president, the vote doesn't go to the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This may not sound so bad, but with something such as this, there could easily be some corruption in that and could change the outcome of the election. But even with this said, it's an unlikeble chance. when you vote, the elector you voted for is most likely going to be an elector which will vote for your president. So no worries.

In conclusion, letting the electoral college stay is a good idea. It is a well thought out system, and the certainty of which president will be elected is completely accurate which doesnt make it a big guessing game. Don't pay attention to those conspiricies of the electoral college, that we have a great system.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think we should keep the way we elect our President because we have for been doing this for so long this why would we change it if it's already perfect? And mostly because if we were to change it then the most of the former US Presidents would'nt even be President because of there rivals? actually had most votes, for instance in the 2000 U.S. President race , Al Gore received more individual votes then George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266, so you see? Bush was'nt the best but he was the closest thing to it, imagine how the U.S.  would be if someone else was President before. Would it be the same? Better? Worse? We will never know because we cant see things that never happened. And isnt the Electoral College a lot eaiser then an election by the popluar vote? So why change it now? We have been doing it this way for over 50 years and we never had a mistake, well not a big one at the very least.            ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

First of all,their are many reasons popular votes are way more usefull and fair then the Electoral College, say one canidate gets 80 percent of the U.S votes but the other candiate wins because of Electoral College vote it just makes no sense. a large anount of americans are considering the Electoral College vote the diaster factor the reasons for that their are many to say such as unfair,outdated,and irrational and much more.""it can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of of carrying their state"". that qute demostrates how some people dont even vote because the Electoral College gives no hope to some potential voters.

Second of all,popular votes are more logical and sensefull then other voting stratigies. to most ameriacns it just makes more sense to use popular voteing procsess then the Electoral College because they actaully have say in the potential president. if potential voters are not voteing because the Electoral College then why have it?"" the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no canidate recevies a majority of the votes"" this quote explains how canidates can not get majority rule over the other canidate.

On the other hand, Electoral College avoids the run-off elections,""the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast""this quote  explains how Electoral College makes the voteing process easier and has less pressure on canidates and voters. also the Electoral College restores some of the weught in the polyical balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apprtioment of the senate decreed in the constitutuion.

2910318AED8D,"Dear State Senator,

I'm aware that there are two ways of electing the president of the United States. According to Source 1 ""What is the Electoral College?"", the Electoral College is a process where electors get elected to vote for President and Vice President. The other option is popular vote. Popular vote is when the people vote, and which ever Candidate gets the most votes wins the election. I personally feel that you should not keep the Electoral College. In my opinion, election by popular vote is a better strategy of electing the President and Vice President of the United States. Electoral College is a horrible strategy, because voters are not actually voting for the President, they are voting for a slate of electors. There are other reasons why I believe that popular vote is a more accurate way of electing the President and Vice President of the United States.

Under the Electoral College system, voters don't actually get to vote for the President, and Vice President. According to Source 2 ""What's wrong with the electoral college?"", the voters vote for a slate of electors who will elect the President. It's possible that the voters may not even know much about the electors that will be electing the President. The electors can be anyone, it depends on what state you are in. According to Source 2 ""What's wrong with the electoral college?"", sometimes the electors may be elected by state conventions, the state party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't even control who their electors vote for sometimes. What if voters choose an elector, and the elector doesn't even vote for the President that the voter was hoping they will vote for? That seems unfair to me, because during this process, there's a chance that the voter may not even get to actually vote for the candidate that they wanted to vote for.

This is why I feel that popular vote is more accurate. Voters get to vote for the candidate that they want to win to be the President, and know that their vote will count. They don't have to worry about electing an elector that can possibly vote for a different candidate. So, may you please consider removing the Electoral College, and replacing it with popular vote?. I'm sure it will make many voters happy that their vote will actually count, and that they will not have to vote for an elector.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
B52827FC9CCD,"For years I've heard that voting time is the choice of the people. But with Electoral College, it's not about the people; it's about the slate electors. When voting for what president the people want, they aren't voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors. But if two people are going for president, and one wins the national popular vote but the other has more electors votes; the one with more electors votes will be president. I think changing the election to popular voting for the president would be better than Electoral College, I'm not the only one that agrees.

When voting time comes around you see a lot of publicity about each person running for office months before the actually voting time. And between that time of the publicity starts and to the voting date you are picking which person you want in office. You may do some research, listen to all the radio or TV interviews, and/or watch all the speeches each person does. The whole time you are set on one person to be president. But yet you can't vote for them, becuase of Electoral College. You vote for the slate electors, the electors vote for the president. Maybe your slate elector doens't want that person, they can vote for the other runner. Voters can't always control whom their electors votes for. Sometimes voters get confused on the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

To pick a electors to depends on the state. Maybe it's a state convention, state party's central committee who chooses, maybe the presidential candidates themselves even. It's not always the people's choice on who is president. It has happened before, two people gone for president, one gets more national votes while the other has more electors votes. And of course, the one with more electors votes goes into office. Even though the people decided they wanted the other runner.

During elections the runner for president tend to only pay attention to the more populated state such as California, New York, Florida, and Texas rather than the smaller states that have less number of electoral votes like Hawaii, Alaska, North and South Dakota, or New Hampshire.

According to Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefennsible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and AFL-CIO all agreed on getting rid of electoral college. Over 60% of votes would rather have a direct election to having Electoral College. They rather have a president win by popular vote than having slate electors vote on a president for them.

Voting for a leader of your country should be the people's choice. Not slate electors. It should be by popular vote, not Electoral College's vote. I say listen to the people, vote on popular vote.                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

060CD5A52BC6,"Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole are some of Americas most beloved politicians, and all of three of them have agreed on the abolishing of the electoral college. This system needs to go. It does not represent this country's ground rules because its non-democratic and does not give enough recognition to some states across the country.

For starters, the electoral college is non-democratic. How can a nation that prides itself on being a democracy not have a democratic way of electing its president? With this electoral college system voters do not vote for the president instead they vote for their states electors which presents a problem in my opinion. As stated in ""Source 3"" ""each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is RARELY broken)."" While some may feel that a system that is rarely broken is acceptable i do not because this is such a big event in our country and we can not afford to have a flawed system. The trust of an entire states vote can not be put in the hands of one elector. America does not get what its people want through this system as you can tell when ""Source 2"" states ""Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college -won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This is not a Democratic way of doing things as the people should be able to elect there president and not have a state of electors do so for them.

Now that the issue of Democracy has been taken care of i want to talk about how some of the states in this country do not get the recognition they diserve. Everyone agrees that all states should have a say in the election of the president and all should feel that there votes matter but this is not the case with the electoral college. As ""Source 2"" states that during the 2000 campaign ""seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina."" This is not acceptable because all voters no matter where they live should feel that there vote is wanted and matters. This could be part of the reason that about only half of the countrys eligable voters voted in the 2012 election as stated in ""Source 3"". While some may say that the electoral college is a great system because it prevents ties i disagee because the likely hood of a tie in the first place when doing popular vote is extremely low and it does not out weight the fact that the people should elect there president.

In the end it is obvious that the elctoral college has to go. There is many reasons why but the two main reasons are that its non-democratic and it does not give recogniton to all the states in this wonderful country.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

This is a letter to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.""There are many reasons to keep the Electoral College"" one reason is because it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote, and the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College because,it is widely regarded as an anachronism. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canaditdate who receives the most populare votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a method sense.It is the electors who elect the the president ,not the people. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed).

Another, reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. But it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning canadate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Last but not least, I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College is because, the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virue of the mal apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A larger state gets more attintion from presidential canadidates in a campaign than a small state does. It can be argued that Electoral College methods of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidates who has no hope of carrying their state. But of  course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about 1/2 the eligible American population did vote in the [2012's] election.

The votes from the people are not directly going towards the candidate they choose. The United States of America offers the right to vote for the president, yet in the end your vote does not go directly toward the candidate of your choice. The Electoral College process is the selection of electors. You help choose your states electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The electors are the ones who really elect the candidate's.

Each party selects a slate of elector's trusted to vote for the party's nominee. The electors rarely betray the trust of the party's. Although it has happened in 2000 with Gore having more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes. That was the first time since 1888.

Although there are not much betrayels the Electoral College is not very trust worthy.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing with elector that would not be faithful and would oppose John F. Kennedy. The popular votes ment for Kennedy wouldn't actually be for him.

The Electoral College is outdated and could get votes confuse by the electors which would cause them to vote for th wrong candidate.

The popular votes would also encourage more people to pay attention to the campain. The people in some states don't pay much attention because they know that their votes will probably not have much effect as if in a popular vote.

The Electoral College is outdated unfair and irrational. If the people of the United States of America have the right to vote, their vote should go directly towards the nomine they choose. The popular vote could have a great effect on the campaigns. Why not allow the people to directly vote for the candidate of their choice instead of taking a chance with the electors that could be unfaithful.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

With the Electoral college process there is also the presidency vote. The presidency vote basically tells us wether they are smart or not. ""Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election then the kind we have now."" In this piece of evidence it shows how the presidency vote inside the Electoral college process can win an election even if you win the popular vote.

Also the Electoral College is a process not a place but their are people that run the Electoral College and they put in who they want and not who the people want.

The counting of the electoral votes is done by Congress. Also the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. ""In Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, youd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" The votes would go to be electoral votes instead of what the people. Someone can be voted in to office by the peoples vote but it has to be that the other person might get in by the electoral votes instead of the individual votes.

The electoral vote overrule the peoples votes. For example ""Obama received 61.7 precent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percentof the popular votes cast for him and Romney.""

In the system of the Electoral College the voters are not truley voteing for the pesident,but for there states elctors. The state electors are the ones who then vote for president. The electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. In simple terms the Electoral College is not fair to voters. The reson behind this is the winner take all system that each state has in place. So the canidates dose not waste time in states they know they have no support or chance of winning the popular vote.

A dispute over the Electoral College's final decision is possible,for example it happened in 2000. However it is less likely than an arughment over the popular vote.

With the Electoral College in place some people dont even see the point in voteing.

The electoral college was established into the Constitution by our founding fathers as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of citizens. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Wherever you live your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional delegation.

Each canidate running for president has his/her own group of electors. The electors are usually chosen by the canidates political party. But each state has different laws. It depends on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The Presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Whenever you vote for whom ever you want to be President, you are also helping choose your states electors. Whenever you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors.

Your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertianment"" after the presidential election listing all of the canidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Also, the certificate declares the winning of the presidential canidate in your state and it shows the electors that will represent your state at the meeting of electors in December of the election year. Your certificate is then sent to the Congress and the National Archoves as part of the official records of the presidential election.

The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900's. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is decieving and unfair. I know people say ""Life's unfair."" and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only made this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality much?

U.S. citizens are being put to shame by every elector in the electoral college. We have the right to vote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we have the right to vote, then let us vote on wether or not to keep the electoral college. I'm pretty sure i'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I am simply a child and that you have no reason to listen to me, but if not me, listen to the rest of our country.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

(passage 2, paragraph 10) As stated by Bradford Plumer, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would have been our president in 2000. If all men are equal, then why are you choosing certain people over the U.S. population. It is utterly decieving to take our votes and throw them away, to make us think that our votes matter when they really don't. If this is who you want to choose our president, then don't have us vote.

Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, that's how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winner-takes-all. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of votes in the electoral college. What puts these electors above me? I am young, but I have a working mind just like my parents. Why do my parents votes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is because the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people above us.

America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we dont change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, even if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesn't work out, then you can continue your way.

2FE74FFEB8A3,"Hello, I am writing to you about the Electoral College and why that I think it should be removed. Why I think we should remove the Electoral College is when voter selects the president they want they are really just picking for a elector who elects the president for them. Also this makes a single rep from Wyoming of 500,00 people has as much say as 55 reps for California who represents 35 million people. The last reason behind this is also being unfair to voters, the winner take all system where in the state the winner of the votes gets them all. So in effect a candidate would spend no time in that per say a swing state. which the may have a chance of winning.

When you vote for the president you really are not voting for him, you're voting for a elector who really elect the president. Also the question is brought up, who picks the electors? This also depends on the state could be the state party's central committee or the presidential candidate's people do. Also another question is what controls the elector from electing the wrong candidate, nothing.

Also why does a single reps in Wyoming with 500,00 people have as much say as 55 reps in California with 35 million people? That is just unfair to the voters, how could that in anyway represent what the majority of the people want. The other way the electoral collage is unfair is the winner take all system I mentioned earlier with majority votes in a state is the state vote, such as if 46 percent of people in a state voted one candidate and 54 for the other insted of just giving the candidates their votes the majority decided one would have them.

The Electoral College is also not a democratic system of voting because the people are really not deciding, and when it is said you are allowing each party to pick a trusted slate of nominees it is not true because the state's central committee not the presidential candidate's reps who are the people really needed to vote for such. In 2000 Gore had more popular votes than bush but less electoral votes, though rare to happen this the president who runs the country for four years at a time so that one rare moment could mean the future of the U.S.A . Also a president does not need to be trans-regional, they only need to appeal to swing states and not ruin relations with their states.

So that was and is my reasoning of why I think that the Electoral College should be removed from our political system. Between the being unfair to voters through voting for electors not even the president, reps not even being scaled right also the winner take all system making the system unbalanced, and the presidential candidates not even needing to appeal to most states just the swing states.

Having the votes by popular votes can make it eaiser for the election of the president. also the electoral votes can really mess up how the elctaion is taking place. it can make them mest up there counting of the votes or how the votes go through.

The electoral college can make a hard impact on how the voting process begins with. The electoral college can confuse the voter by making them chose the wrong person. In the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" the author is stating margin 10 lines 11-13 that "" do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" this is showing how just using the electoral college can easily confuse those who are voting. Also in many occouins occured when the electoral college didnt suceesed right. in the passge "" The Indefenseible Electoral College"" the author states in margin 11 lines 2-4 that "" The american people should consider themselves lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse."" This is showing how the electoral college alomost cost a big mistake in the election.

The electoral college is not consider a democratic syestem. thats why many people go agianst it because its not equaly fair to those who are democratic. IN the passge "" In Defense of the Electoral College"" the writer states in margin 15 and in lines 4-5 that "" the advocates of this postion is correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense..."" This is showing that not all of it is fairly equal. So instead of using the electoral college it is a better method to go with popular vote becuase it a simplier way to do it. Establishing this will rapdily take on more votes then it would be a close race agianst both of the presidents. Chosing a president with the Electoral College can make the electation go bad, so thats why having people vote who they want would be a more fair chance for those who are voting.

It comes out that the Electoral College is a siginficient way to do a vote on. the more imporant way to do a voting should be a popular vote because it gives the presidents a better chance to have the elecations on a good pace. instead of many votes go through then have to be checked on by state.

One, the people are being ruled by this president, don't you think every one should get a say in who they want the president to be. Two, Electoral College is not at all fair. Lastly if you have all the people of the United States vote then the process will be more accurate.

When you're about to get a brand new car, what do you do? You take it out for a test drive, and see how it runs, and if you like the design and the features it has. Am I right? Well think, if your about to get a new president, and let me remind you they will be in charge of the way you live, don't you think you want to have a say in wether or not you like him or her? It's just like testing out a new car. You bring your family and take a vote on who likes it. The more votes you have the better, because then you see how many like it and how many don't.

This Electoral college is not fair at all. It only allows 538 people to get to vote for president. What if the majority of those people wanted a certaint president, and the people that didnt get to vote wanted the other president. Thats not fair. Those people didn't even have a chance. If you weren't apart of the Electoral college how would you feel? Isn't the United States ""The land of the free."" Then every one should have a say in who their president is going to be.

If you have every one in the United States vote then the dominant vote will be much more efficent. More people will be satisfied, and less complaints and assinations. Think about it. The popular vote is the way to go. When your doing a science experiment they say to take as many trials as you possibly can because the experimentation results will be much more accurate.

Electoral College should we keep it or change it, to election by popular vote? Well alot of people dislike it and some like the electoral college. There are certian asspects about both electoral college and election by popular vote that should be looked at closey before you choose which one works and wich one dosen`t.

Keeping electoral college I believe its best for our voting proccess.

Why because in 2012 Oboma received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes. His percentage with popular vote was 51.3 percent, so if you voted for him electoral college bumped up his percent by a good amount. The electoral college also helps avoid problems of the elections such as no candidat receives a majority of the votes that were cast. Electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose by vitue of the ma-apportionment, witch means to me that larger states have larger percentages and between the two candidates the percents can be close so the electoral college just helps us pick one of the candidates.

Popular vote has some good asspects to it aswell. Popular vote helps bump up your percentage of votes before electoral college is added, so it makes it an even better chance for the candidate you voted for to win the election. I believe people perfer popular vote because to me if I'm correct popular vote is the amount of votes acandidate got from the people and I know alot of people like it when their choice gets picked and no one else tried to i guess you could say meess with the votes.

Electoral to me is the way to go so I believe you should keep it. It seems that it gives candidates a better chance of their percentage going up so the have a better chance of winning.                                                               ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Changing the electoral college to popular vote is an amazing idea because well the people will have a more say so then just voting for an elector. In the three aricles I was given I happen to come a crooss to many  reason why the elctoal college should be banned or removed.

First of all, the Electoral College came to be because the founding fathers needed a compomise to set their differences aside to find out a way to elect the president and now that technology and human development has changed and every thing is changing why cant we change the way we elect our president. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. To win the presidential election you have to get 270 electoral vote. The article ""T

he Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong

"" it says that "" the electoral colege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take-all sustem in each state, candidate don't spend time in states they know the have no chance of winning. this qoute means to say that the candidates dont take the time to go to place they dont think they're going to win over but thats the problem just because the other candidate has tht state one the people in the state could probably gradually go for the other candidate values or moral. "" Its official: The electoral college is unfair and outdated and irrational"". this quote means that we as American Citizen we need to improve our voting system ou with the old and in with the new.

second of all, their are many reason why th electoral college should change o popular voting. Well one reason why that they should change it is because ""under the electoral system, voters vote not for he president but, for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" this quote means that instead of voting for the president your actually voting for the people who are going to vote for them. When people go voting I would think that they would want to actually vote for Barack Obama but instead your actually not. That system needs to be banned if thats suppose to be a good way to vote well then it needs to be changed because if he U.S. is for the people and by the people  well then the ""people"" should have a more wider range of  who gets to be the president of the United States then just someone else voting for them.

To conclude the system for the electoral college should be changed and it needs to be changed. The elctoral college is a unfair and not the right way to do things and as a U.S. citizen changing it wiil make it easier for me to have a say so in who gets elected for the president  o the United States.                                                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I personally feel that we should abolish the Electoral College and change the election by popular vote. I don't think it is fair to our voters who vote for the president when they are really voting for the state of electors. The Electoral College really has the final say on who is going to be elected president of the United States. The citizens of the United States should be the one who elect the president instead of the Electoral College.

First of all, the Electoral college is a little outdated now a days. The Electoral College has been used for a very long time and it should be changed. To me I believe that it just makes sense to have voters to vote for our president instead of the winner-take-all system. It wouldn't even make sense to vote if you know that the Electoral College is going to actually elect the president. Abolishing the Electoral College is just the best way to go.

Next, The Electoral College is just unfair to the voters who vote for the president. It is because of the wininer-take-all system. The candidates dont't go to states they know they are going lose in.

I know you have been thinking about if we should still use ""Electoral collage"" or changing to election by ""popular vote for the president of the United States."" I am here to inform you that i believe that keeping the Electoral College may still help us. By having Electoral College you can swing states and biggers states.

To begin with, keeping the electoral college may be a good idea. When having you could swing states. In the passage ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President"" the passage states that ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates""(paragraph 20) The qoute is explaining that by having candidates from toss up states, the voters would help the elections. The voters would actually be interested in the electon and pay attention to what is happening. Having voters from toss up states may help decide the election.

Second, Keeping Electoal College may benefit us in many ways. If we keep Electoral College than we would bring in bigger states. In the passage its states that "" The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution."" (paragraph 21) The quote is explaing that when there is a bigger state involved then the larger states would get the most attention from any presidential candidates. Being a larger states give people more of a advantage. An example they gave in the paragraph 21 (5. big states) it explains that ""the popular vote was very close in florida(in 2012); nevertheless obama, who won that vote,got 29 electoral votes."" the example was explaining that since florida was bigger we got more votes so that lead to Obama winning.

C4804C3EEBD7,"I think that we should keep the Electoral College but we could also change election by popular vote because there could be problems over the outcome of an Electoral College, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Voters in toss-up are more likely to pay close intention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. It also restores some weight in the political balance. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electoral. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Your states Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Voters can expect close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The person who picks the electors in the first place depends on the state.

The argument against the electoral college is what we might call disaster factor. If there is a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote. the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the right races in the swing states. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee, but it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Elecotral college is widely regarded as an person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present, it's a non- demogratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receive most popular votes the winner.

So i think we should keep electoral college because it's a process not a place.

One direct vote could count for ten votes or it could count for two votes and most people would rather have their vote count as just their vote. Electoral votes in a lot of peoples minds is just unfair all around. One president could be the favorite among the voters but the electors the president has to back him up with electoral votes could maybe not be as big as another presidents electors and its pretty much, in many peoples eyes, giving the least popular among the people president an easier way to become president.

Adults that vote like knowing that their vote really counts for the person theyre voting for. That is why people would much rather have a direct way of voting than the electoral college, which is taking one vote from one person, and say there are thirty electors in that one slab for the person you voted for, and giving that person thirty votes for the person they want elected. People find this way of voting unfair because they dont like the fact that the person they voted for could get the most popular votes, but the number of electors there are for the person is not very many, so their votes count as less than others do. Many feel that they are being deprived of their right to vote because one person could be voting but they get 10 votes while another peson could be votin and only get 6 and its not equal for all people.

People who vote for a president that gets the most popular votes, and they dont win the election, can start big disputes among the way the elections are carried out. When a president wins only the electoral votes and not the popular vote, many dont feel like they are actually their president. Most people would prefer direct voting because it actaully makes everybodys votes count equally and everybody has equality. Winning electoral votes doesnt show that you won because the majority of people wanted you to win, it shows you have many supporters to give you more votes through the electoral college.

Direct voting would be a better way to vote so that everybody felt like their votes really counted towards who they voted for and that they arent getting cheated because one president has more electors supporting them. The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. I would like to bring something to your attention that has been on my mind recently. I think the electoral college is important in picking our presidents and i think that it needs to stay apart of our voting process. The Electoral college is in our history and the founding fathers didnt put it there to just be removed. The Electoral College needs to stay apart of our voting process beause we always have the certainty of outcomes, Everyones presidents, and it avoids run off elections.

With an Electoral College we' ll always have the certainty of outcomes because the winning canidate's share of electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote. Also its highly unlikely for a tie in the electoral college unlike in popularity.

In the Electoral College everyones president. This is such a big part because the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the electoral college.

Why would we vote for a group of people to vote for us? it doesnt make sense, why not just vote on our own, that way we know we voted for whom we really wanted

? voting for an electoral group is like going to vote and saying ""Hey, im going to vote today for a group that will hopefully vote for the presisdent i want."" I personally would not put my faith in someone who could just so easily change their mind and not vote for my choice.

I do see the reasoning in having an electoral college so that way we are less likely to end up with a tie or any other mishaps. however why would we not instead just have an extra group of say, 50 people to vote if we end up with a tie? I find that would be much easier. people would be able to just vote for whom they wanted and be done with the whole situation.

Remeber the disaster factor? we are lucky that 2000 situation was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows far worse. our legislatures are responsible technically for picking electors, and the chosen electors can always go against the will of the people.

what if a tie does occur in the electoral vote? it nearly happened in 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; in 1976, a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voter in hawaii had voted the other way. the election is only a few swing voters away from a disaster.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winmning, focusing on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

I am in full favor of the Electoral College process. I think that this process is a great way to elect president because we rely on the electors vote. By relying on the electors vote, we don't have to worry about the popular votes messing up the election. I say messing up because a lot of people aren't paying attention to the election, so they vote out of a random pick. This could influence the presidential outcome of who becomes president.

Also, the Electoral College process goes to a series of elections. This is better because when we vote for the president, we are actually voting for the electors. After that election, the electors vote for the president on a more serious note. The electors take charge of your your state, and vote for the most reasonable president. They discuss the bad and good qualities protraying to each president. Based on thier dussicion, America will have the best president there is.

To add on, the election process by popular voting can be easily screwed up. This process can be messed up by none serious voters who choose the worse president. This election process can be messed up by people choosing a president and not even paying attention to the qualities that the president has. The president that they pick could have some awful characteristics, along with the presidents decisions.

To conclude, we should keep the Electoral College process and not even think about the popular vote process. The Electoral College process, we rely on the electors to make the right decision for America. We don't want a bad president by going with the popular voting process.

First off, I disagree with the Electoral College. I have a strong hope that we need to change to election by popular vote for president. The Electoral College is a process of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress (office of the federal Register 2). In source two it announces that the electoral college is an unfair way to votes. In my opinion I agree strongly with that statement because not everyone would get a fair oppurtunity.

Secondly, everyone has the right to voice their opinion on who they want to elect as president. With the Electoral College we wouldn't be able to voice our opinion as because as Source 2 explains that if you have Electoral College system the voters would vote for a slate of electors, but not for president. The state of electors would be the ones to elect the president. Therefore the people wouldnt get a voice to vote only the 29 people in Florida-shown on the map in source 3-not the whole state which makes it not an equal oppurtinuty to everyone who lives in that state.

Next, when having Electoral College instead of population vote the picked voters could pick someone wrong. In source two it mentions that sometimes the senator could vote for the wrong person sometimes and not always can they control their vote. To add on to that the electoral college is the ""disaster factor"". The reason that it is the diaster factor is because the state legislatures are responsible for picking the electors and they could pick everyone thats agasinst a certain president and that the ""better"" president isn't picked and has a chance of our state being ruined.

This change should be decided in a properly manner by the people and citizens of the country. This explains the purpose of this letter, to abolish the Electoral College. I have this opinion because it is unfair to the people. Sometimes, the electors tend to provoke the system too. However, if there is a way to keep it, we can use it if there is a tie between the Presidency voting.

The best argument that I have towards this action is plain and simple: it's unfair! Voting is all about going to the poll and having the excitment of knowing that your vote can change the next 4 years of your life, including America's life. This should not include the other electors in the house or the people in office. This is a democracy country, therefore, we the people should decide who the President is. With the Electoral College in process, the citizens votes are not a 100% necassity. The

Winner- Take all voting should be established. It's just floating around because it's the first step in voting. The next step is the Electoral College where Congress makes the next decison. This is wrong because the people need to have the final say on the voting because we are effected the most.

Another important reason why the Electoral College needs to be voted out is because the electors in Congress tend to provoke the voting. According to

Source 1:

What is the Electroal College, you are actually choosing your candidate's electors, not the actual president. Now your trust is in the candidates hands. At this point in time, you probably think its safe right? That those people know what  there doing, but chances are that they dont. There goes many other things to stress about! At one point, the candidates did not even vote for the ""correct"" President which is a stab in the back to the voters. This is why there are trust issues with the voting.

Besides all the negativity that you've been hearing throughout this letter, there is a possibility that we can compromise. First, all the people that want to vote will vote, but the Electoral College will only be needed if there is a tie between the people to Presidency vote. If not, then the people decide. Without the Electroal College present, the smaller states have the same equality and strength as the larger states as

Source 3: In Defense of the Electroal College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president says. That source clearly implies that voters tend to pay too much attention to the campaign but everyone including the people in Congress see it, so what really makes the difference in voting? Without the Electroal College, voting would not be so indecisive.

To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecassary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldnt be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.

Voting in the United States of America has always been the same way, by using the Electoral Collage to cast votes for the presidency. Now, the Presidential Election should be based on poular vote rather than using the Electoral Collage. It is an unfair, unbalanced method for determining the president of the United States. Every president changes history, so if the wrong one is put into office, American history can be altered.

An unfair, proposterious method is sure to have great detestment. Say one canidate had the majority of votes from the American people, by popularity. Yet, the other candidate had the majority of Electoreal votes from the Electoral Collage. The canidate who recieved votes from the Electoral Collage wins, even though his opponant had the American peoples' majority vote. This happened in the year 2000, when nominee Al Gore had more popular votes the George W. Bush, yet fewer electoreal votes, allowing Bush to be president. Even more so, when voting for a presidential canidate, one is in truth voting for a late of electors, rather than voting for the canidate straight on. (Source: #3) If the electors vote one way, when the majority of a state really wants to have the opposing side, there is nothing that can be done to change the electoral votes. Some may argue this is a fair method, but in reality, it is not. (Source: #2)

No American should be misprepresented when voting for a presidential nominee.

Unbalanced voting is sure to be an uproar, especailly when speaking about the president of the United States. California has the most Electoreal votes, stacking up at 55 votes in the Electoral Collage. Wyoming, along with other states, has a mere three votes. A grand total of 538 Electoral votes is what results from adding up all states votes, but 270 is needed to win the presidency. It won't matter who has the popular vote, all that matters is the person who wins the electoral vote. On the other hand, people who live in states with small populations may argue this is a more representing way of voting for president. But it really isn't balanced. The state may have a popular vote towards one side, but when the electoral voter palces his vote, he may choose to betray the people of the state. People cannot change the electoral vote if they are misrepresenting their state. That doesn't sound balanced or equal at all. The scales should not tip towards the lighter side. If the election was determined based on popular vote, rather than the Electoral Collage, then the American people would recieve a more accurate determination of presidency rather than what is already in place.

An unfair, unbalanced mehtod should be thrown out the window, trashed. People want want people want, and should be fairly and equally treated to reflect thier true intents. The Electoral Collage is an unfair, unbalaned election strategy that should be disregarded. We should change this election to using popular vote to acurratly, justly portray the wants and political views of the people living in the United States, where the citizens have power in determining what they choose happens in the counrty. The land of the free, America, should have free say in choosing the president. Abolish the Electoral Collage, and instead put in its place the means of popular voting.

Thank you for your consideration.

Senator ,

I would like to keep the Electoral College because i think it works out better than the popular vote. If we had the popular vote then there would be an unfair voting cast and we would be introuble. I think they would abuse the voting if it was by popular vote and plus it only requires 270 electoral votes to elect the president and theres 538 electors. I think we should just keep the Electoral College for a couple years and then switch and see which ones better and keep that one.

In some states they have only a limited number of electors depending on how big or small the state is. Also the winner takes all system should go with both presidents because they both worked hard to get there and shouldnt just be left out they should seperate the electors evenly some people cant become the president or vice president so they shouldnt leave out the vice president.  It states in the article that over 60 pecent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Also it says under nthe electoral college system, votes dont vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Theres also rumors of the Electoral College like people calling it the disaster factor because people say it cause to much drama and is risky. I understand if there was a tie in the Electoral vote then it would be all up to the house of representatives where state delegations vote on the president. It should just be up to the citizens to chose who runs for president so that way there isnt such big arguments over who became president. Thank you for your time.

AB3622039528,"Dear Florida State Senator,

Im writing this letter because I think that keeping the Electoral Collage is unfair to the citizens of the united staes and the candidates running for president. I think that keeping the Electoral Collage is unfair for many reasons. When i read this passage it gave me a claim, to get rid of the Electoral Collage, and it gave me the counter claim, to keep the Electoral Collage. Both the claim and counterclaim gave facts to show what they thought was right, but as i read this passage i thought that we shouldnt keep the Electoral Collage.

The main reason i think we should not keep the Electoral Collage is because its unfair. For example when citizens of the united states go to vote on election day every four years and they vote for who they would do the best job at making choices for our country. Their vote doesnt go to the candidates it goes to the Electoral Collage. I think that is unfair because its atcually them who get to pick the president of the united states not the citizens. That is also unfair for the candiates becuase they spend alot of time and money to get people to vote for them and when the people vote for them it doesnt really count because the Electoral Collage atcually picks who is and is not president.

I also dont like the winner take all method of voting. When that happens its like the other peoples vote never counted. When the winner take all method happens voters in toss up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign. They receive the most information and attention from the candidates. Even if they go all out when its time to start voting that doesnt mean that they should be able to decide the election. Everyone elses vote matters too.

Some People think that the Electoral Collage should stay because they think that the Electoral Collage is a process not a palce. The passage says ""The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress."" That just pretty much showed us how they Electoral Collage system worked. Even though most people think that the system should stay I think it should go. It should go for many reason. The main reason that I think it should go is because its not fair.

A5E83958D94D,"The electoral college is a process that consist of the elections of the electors. The electors all meet up and vote for the future President and Vice President. The electoral college consist of a numerous amount of electors from all different states in orde to provide each state with one or more electors to represnt the statesthoughts and decisions. The electoral college should be changed because people are being represented incorrectly, and the method used may turn away potential candidates.

To begin with, many factors provide sufficent support for the Electoral College to be removed and one is that the citizens of the state and not being represented correctly. The citizens are misrepresented due to the fact that they are not the ones who directly vote for the President. In the system the process is that the citizens vote for an elector who then goes to vote for the President and Vice President. What may happen is that the citizens vote for an elector who says that they might vote for a certain candidate but then when the time comes for the voting to take place the elector may have changed his final decision on who he wants to vote for so the citizens who voted for him expecting that he would vote for a certain candidate do not get the proper vote because the elector changed his vote. This may cause a descrepensy becuase the citizens are not being represented correctly causing tHEM to become upset and start a huge problem because they feel that the trust they put in their electors was misused.

In addition, another problem that arises due to the Electoral College is that people may feel disencouraged to vote. Due to the fact that voters vote for a representative who then votes for the President they may feel that their vote has no affect. If the citizens feel that they have no hope in carrying their state then they will not vote causing the polls to decrease. This process turns down potential voters for a certain candidate causing the poll to not work in its full affect with everyone voting and having inacurate representation.

In conclusion, the Electoral College            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5B43D8B934CC,"Started with the founding fathers. The Electoral College was founded and swung into the constitution, as a compromise between Congress and the President with a popular and electoral vote. Now that time has evolved and the world has changed. The Electoral College is not in the favor of everyones expectations, it seems like it favors one side more than it favors others. The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe.

Intially, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing presidents. The Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, ""Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" The candidates in the ""lame"" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are ""the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election."" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized.

Also, the Electoral College can be known as a non-democratic method. When something is non-democratic, it means that it is not in the democrats favor. It is a rap for them, its already set for the Republicans to win. Stated in the passage, ""In a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" Democrats may cast in their vote for presidential candiate comes with a group of electors, they see the electoral college as favorable towards the Republican group.

Next, the Electoral College should be changed, because it causes catastrophe. When voting for president, it puts the electors in charge. ""Electors can be anyone not holding public office."" One may never know how much the elector is trustworthy, and responsible. Some may not even feel comfortable with leaving the electors in charge of such cases. People feel uneasy, because they do not know what happens behind close doors, they are never certain on who's hands can change things for the benefit of themselves. The citizens and the people may not be comforatbe with such things.

But, as much as the Electoral College may not seem beneficial and fair to some it can be a good thing also. Stated in the passage ""Election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where delegations vote on the president."" Us people, us as citizens would not even be in charge or have a say so in who runs our country. We would not even have a choice or chance to vote and see who is worthy and most honorable in our eyes to be our president. Some may be lucky on the Representative choices on who the Electors and our Presidents would be, but also some may be dissatisified. The favor will only be in the representaives place. And the odds will be onto us. The Electoral College is not ran by the Representatives. We have a say so.

Finally, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing the president, it is also known as a non-democratic method of having one side favored, and it can cause catastrophe. The Electoral College shows a wide range of it either being a good or a bad way on voting.                ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
63FEB8D784FD,"In these 3 sources they're talking about electoral college, I beileve electoral college is a good and smart way to handle elections. AN electoral college is a process made by the founding fathers and they estabilshed it in the constitution. Some people planned on abolishing it, I think thats and i'll show you why.

First,I beileve they should not abolish it because its so origanal and whats the reason it needs to be abolished. They're probably planning on making a new system or doing it for a personal matter. Either way, its all depending if the congress and the president himself to agree on this. Overall abolishing a this from the constitution where its been for too long is wrong. Even though this method is not democratic its still not right to abolish this from the constitution.

And, I also know why they are some reasons why they wouldn't want this method to be here. In source 2 it stated ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors"". Everything depends on the state because it decides most of the voting standards of the whole state. This method can also defy the will of the people, sounds anti-republican and just wierd for legislatures to screw with the votes you jotted down. This practictly almost made JFK not a president apparently he got lucky. Richard Nixon voted aand validated his predidency.

In society now, millions of people go to the voting stands to vote when our opinion says nothing to the way we actually pick a President. I believe the vote of the poeple is what should matter when choosing out leader.

the Electoral College is currently the way we decide who will become our President, as many know. Though what most do not know is our votes do not count for anything. The people of the United States of America should have their basic right to choosing who tells them what to do. The way it should go is, everyone who lives in the USA who is over eight-teen should be eligiable to vote, and have the vote count. We should be choosing our President, not some big shot in a suit.

If we were able to choose our President it would be less hectic. All you would have to do is count up the votes of every state in America and round them up. Who ever we choose as the winner should be put to a test, a simulator type thing. We use an example of the world in the most horrific state, no money, taxes through the roof, angry people eveyrwhere with the President, and they have to fix it.

Today I am going to write about how electoral colleges work. The Electrical College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of a President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Do you want to learn more? Then just keep on reading and I will tell you more.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Our state's entitled allotmeant of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for our Senators.

Each candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidiate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Most states have a ""Winner-take-all

"" system that awards al electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportional representation.""

What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the Presidential candidates themselves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Perhaps most worrying is the prospct of a tie in the electoral vote. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a President and ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the the President, nort the people. When you vote for a Presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Yet this has happened very rarely. It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. There are 5

Why should we change whats already been working for us? You would never know how the outcome of thing will turn out.

Would u rather vote for President congress or citizens i pick congress because they already know what u have to do in order to do certain thing, our citizens dont know as much.

According to Richard Posner "" the Electoral College is widely regarder as an anachrinism"" how can u say that now after years and years of this going on.  It advoids problems of elections. Even though states thst know their votes will not have aeffect it still can help. It doesnt belong in the past if it help us pick this many president. Electoral College help reduce when there is pressure for run-off to chose a winner.

Toss up states that can make a diffrence in the voting. Campaign focus on those the most cause they knowow important it is to them winning. In 2012 toss up states help the winner out because they are the most thoughtful voter. And the most thoughtful voter should be the ones the vote. Say's Richard Posner "" and for the futher reason that thye will have the most infromation and attention"" tell you how make of a imapct the toss up states our.

Just like a toss up states of course you going to want to go somewhere there more people to hear you. Thats why you chose a big state to help you out with that.

Because of the winner take all system these candidates don't even go and vist some states beacuse they know they wouldn't have a chance of winning. This can also lead to some states not having the chance to ever see or meet the candidate just like in 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't have a chance of seeing the candidates at all.

I believe that the way of voting for a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president. Some Runner-ups have had the backing of the popular vote and not won because of the Electoral College. Several things you should consider is people can actually vote though popular vote, the minority will have a better chance, and presidents have lost to the Electoral College.

First, People can actually vote, when people go to vote for the next preident or the returning one they arent actually voting for the president they are voting for electoral votes but some state wont even allow people to vote for that. Some states the electors vote for who they want and the peoples votes they are accounting for become nothing. They go out and vote for nothing. "" Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors wiht new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.""(source 2) This is what cna happen when poeple can vote who they want and u have electors doing it for them they will put someone in the race that no one wants to really be there. But some poeple say that the Electoral College is there to help us and to help most states have the winner take all system. "" The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""(source 2) which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some.

Next, The minority will have a chance, If there ever is a deadlock in the campiagn the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance."" Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (source 3) that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. "" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.""(source 3)

Continueing on that note, Runner-ups have lost due to electoral vote but have won the popular vote.""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- tanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost preisidency.""(source 2) Which means Al Gore would have been president and not the other guy. Which would have changed today in one way or another. Some people do say The electoral vote is for the better. "" The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President."" (source 1)But why do they get to vote for them and we dont.

In Conclusion, The Electoral College should be eradicated and the popular vote should take its place. The popular vote is better because people can actually vote, the minority will have a chance, Presidents loss becasue of Electoral Vote but win the Popular vote.

With the elctoral college vote most of people are not getting what they prefer. For the the electoral college vote, voters vote fro not the president, but for a not slate of electors. With the popular vote people are actually getting what they voted for.

The best argument against the electoral college is what we might  call the disaster college. Consider that state legislatures are techanically responsible for picking electors and that those electors that were voted for couls always defy the will of the people. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Some mat argue that they like the electoral vote but majority of the people would rather have the popular vote. It does not make any sense to me how the president with the votes does not win the presidential election. The electoral college is unfair for all voters that vote. When you think of a vote and how it works you would think by the most one with the most votes wins cause that pretty much means that most of the people would rather have the most wins over the win that had less votes but more electoral votes.

The electoral college election consist of the 538 electors. All you have to do is win most of those votes and you win the election. It is pretty unfair for the rest of the people that are votting for presidential election. The majority of the 270 electoral vots is required to elect the president. When you vote for the president you are also voting for your candidate and the candidate's electors.  Electors are people that are not holding public office. To be elector the state chooses and sometimes state conventions, state party's central committee, and the presidential candidate themsleves.

They should not really even call it the presidential election casue when you vote for presidential candidate you are actually voting for slate electors. Each party selects a slte of electors trusted to vote for the party's nminee and represent them. In 2000 Gore the popular votes which means most people would have rather had him then bush but bush won the electional because the electoral votes. There is really not a reason why the people should vote because either way the electors are choosing the preisdent. The people are showing who they want but really does not matter that much. The only reason why people vote for the poplar vote because the if there is tie between the electoral vote it goes to the popularity vote.

In conclusion, I think we should change the electoral vote to the popular vote because the majority of the voters should get what they voted. I think it is unfair for all the people that vote and does not really do anything unless there is tie in the electoral vote.

I feel as if we should have a say on who we vote for President...Am I right? But at the same time we do need a majority of votes from a Electoral College who knows a little bit more then us. That is why Im here to say that Election by popular vote for the President of the United States would be better then having a Electoral College that is most likely Segregationists vote for us.

It is said that if we would had popular votes for the President instead of Electoral College,we would most likely have a better chance of getting a President that would be the best at his country then to get someone that is just a favorite of a country of a state by segregationists,meaning someone that just like you from your race or skin color,but at the same time the Electoral College is established cause of our founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote. A Electoral College is consist of 538 electors and 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President,we on the other hand,get a few people that we voted on for voting for the president and vice president,and sometimes that can be the wrong president we pick or get confused picking the wrong candidates. But I feel the people who support who we have as Presidents should be abled to have a say on what they think and feel on the President,cause after all,we need someone to look up to.

Another way that I feel the popular vote should be the best thing then the Electoral College is that in Source 2:Pharagraph 14, it explains how the Electoral College is unfair,outdated,and irrational,its like even if we won our votes then basically the Electoral College won dued to The winner-take-all system in each state. I feel this is unfair cause its basically stating that the Electoral College vote is the vote that they will accept even though we are voting to,but at the same time they have more say and know how on what we dont know about the Presidents and the Vice Presidents,but having favored seperation based on race. Source 3:phargraph 23 explains that the Electoral College method of selecting the President may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state,I feel as if popular voters dont look into political preference then to just pick a vote and hope that their pick is going to be the President. The Electoral College gets into all the questions and discuss who would be the best, however, a popular vote would just be that the person is their favorite just like the Electoral College.

Mr. State Senator,If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.  Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us.                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

If the slogan of our nation is ""We the people,"" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? How can a president win the popular vote but lose the presidency? None of that makes any sense. Our nation needs to abolish the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The system of the Electoral College is irrational, unfair, and not for the citizens.

To begin, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" (Plumer, paragraph 13). ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (Plumer, paragraph 11). If the United States is really all about the citizens, then they do not have a good way at showing it. We as citizens live here, and call this nation our home, but yet we can not even elect our own president. The Electoral College is unfair to us as voters.

In addition, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a state of electors."" (Posner, paragraph 15). That textual evidence came from a passage in defense of the Electoral College! We the people should have a say! This system is not for us as citizens of the United States, and it is wrong! This is our home so let US pick our president.

Furthermore, ""... and the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" (Posner, paragraph 20). This statement is very true because voters should be thorough when voting, but why should we be? It is not like we need to take our time and compare and contrast the presidential candidates. We are not voting for the president of our choice, so what is the point of being thorough? It is wrong to have this system, and it needs to be changed.

To conclude, as I have said above, If the slogan of our nation is ""We the people,"" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? The system of the Electoral College needs to be abolished. It is not letting us as citizens elect our choice of the president that we want. It is unfair and irrational. I am in favor of changing the system to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
C7A11347755E,"Dear state senator,

The Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. I say this because, as successful as the Electoral College has been, it has many flaws. In the first sentence of the eleventh paragraph, the article mentions something called the disaster factor. This is an alarming possiblity. State legislatures are, in a way, responsible for choosing electors who may ignore the will of the people.

During 1960, in the Louisiana legislature, people titled Segregationists almost succeeded in removing the Democratic electors and replacing them with new electors. These new electors were supposed to oppose John F. Kennedy so that any popular votes for Kennedy would not have really gone to him. If those Segregationists had succeeded in their plan, John F. Kennedy would not have won the popular vote. That was indeed a close call, and it could happen yet again in the near future without fail. On another similar topic, ""faithless"" electors have, from time to time, denied the option to vote for their party's candidate. Instead of voting for the candidate of their own party, they cast a vote for whomever they wish.

Also occuring in 1960, a state sent two slates of electors to Congress. Vice President Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors. Thankfully, he was presiding over the Senate at the time. He made sure to validate the slate of his choosing ""without establishing a precedent."", as stated in paragraph eleven, sentence 9. Hopefully, this will not occur again anytime soon.

The most worrying occurance would be a tie. However, if a tie were to happen in an electoral vote, the election would be thrown towards the House of Representatives. There, the state delegations vote on the president. In 1976, a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 voters from Hawaii had voted the other way. This is bad because the election is only a few voters away from a distaster. In conclusion, the Electoral College is not only unfair, but outdated and irrational. It should be shifted from the way it is now to total amount of popular votes for the president of the United States.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

After conducting studies on the American voting system ,I noticed many flaws. Deciding on presidency is one of the most vital processes in any countrie,so it should be addresed properly. the fact that voters vote not for president ,but they vote for slate of electors,the electors can be anyone not holding public office,and the fact that 17 states were never visited during 2000 only focusing on swing states  are just some facts we must look at when deciding a nations fate.

The fact that voters dont vote for president ,but they are actually voting for electors is should be looked into because the people are not  voting for president .The are voting for people to vote for president .which throughly explains the idea that the majority oppinion of the nation is invaluable to the goverment and our society  .This system is not fair .Nor is this system equal. and nor should this system continue to destroy our beloved countrie .

The electors can be anyone not holding public office .This is one of the most gruesome facts about this topic .Bestowing any dreg of society the honor of being an elector is NOT a good idea .This means when one of us votes for an elector trusting him with the fate of the nation. He could mislead us and vote for any canidate making the whole voting system corrupt and misleading.

17 states were unvisited by canidates in 2000. which leads U.S citezens  to ask questions like:Is our oppinion valuable or even considerd valid ? Do the leaders want to run for the benefit of this countrie or do they want POWER?Do our votes even matter or make a diffrence ?Should we just give up on the corrupt system we must live under today?

Thinking about the subject from the prepective of our founding fathers .They would NEVER want a voting system like ours today were people's oppinions dont matter,With often and misleading corrupt electors  not letting the majority rule .This system should be put to an end ,So our countrie can live free again.                                                                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I know befor you were senator you voted just like us and you know how frustrating it can be somethings. The Electoral Collage sould be discarted and Presidents of the united states should be elected by popular vote. If we do the popular vote it will be more efficent and be easier to keep track of. We have to do it because The Electoral collage it's failed to elect a President , the masses (the people) don't get to pick the president, and its outdated.

Firstly, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it has failed to elect a President in the past. In the case of a tie in electoral votes it would be the task of the house of representatives the elect a president and the way they elect the presidnt is worse then the electoral collage. even thought and exact tie in the predidental elections has not occored so the catostrify of the house of representatives electing the presisdent has not happen yet ,but it is entirly  possible.

Secondly, we need to abolissh the Electoral collage because the masses (the people) don't get to the president. In the  electoral collage usage of the system resalts in the

People electing the electors ,to elect the president. And in this system the eletors can pull a switcharoo and vote for the other canadent if they so please, to betray the people by doing so. allthought its system has worked scince the founding of our country ,it is still quirky and disfunctionable at times. the electoral collage allows the electors to do as they please if a elector for florida promises to pick one president and gets all the votes to got to the electoral collage he can choose the Other canadent because his freind wanted him to. how stupid is that!

Thirdly, we need to abloish the electoral collage because it is outdated. in our day and time we have smart phones and aindroids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the compuster can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its  also outdated becouse we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america.

In conclusion, we need to abolish the electoral collage because it can fail to elect a president(which is almost did in 1960), the masses (the people) can't elect the president(they have to elect the electers to elect the president, and also is is very outdated. in my opion, we should also consiter tweking the electoral callage instead of just getting rid of it.                                                                                                  ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

From: PROPER_NAME

DEAR:Mr. state senator.

There has been many contraversies over the electoral colledge. The contraversies have been wether America should keep the this form of electing presidents or abolish it from our humanity. The electoral colledge,for many years,has been a effective and conveinient way of an election. As was stated in source three,""the electoral colledge is widely regarded as an anarchronism"". this means that this way of electing a president has been around for many years and was meant for this country. There are three reasons why it is  important to keep the method of an electoral colledge. For one,professional slate of electors can be trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Two,this method is more convienient,and lastly posses more acuracy.

The first reason why keeping the electoral colledge is important is because of professional slate of electors. these people or voted on by inndividuals to vote for there nominee president. these people can be trusted on a high level because of there preactices over the years.

The second reason why keeping he electoral colledge is important is because it is far more convieneint for most people. Reular individual voting may take up someones day by haveing them wait hour at a time in lineat a polling station. this is very unconvient to the person,especially if there day is buisy. what the electoral colledge does is take that persons vote into the hands of someone else. this save time and money for the averadge person.

The last reason why keeping the electoral colledge is important is because it pposses more accuracy than a regular vote. As stated in source three,""because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis"". this means that a person with more electoral votes than popular votes may win an election. this is because electoral votes way more in a way.

this concludes my reasoning why the electoral colledge should be kept in the American way of electing presidents. the reasons for this is,for one,proffecional slate of electors can be trusted. Two,it is more convienient,and three,it is more effective.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

First of all not only are candidates wanting to vote for the person thay want to they dont have a chance popular vote wont win.

The first reason we should change this is the persident could win even if he/she is not popular with the people. The president could win the popular vote but lose the Electoral Collage vote. A good example of this is the 2000 election between Gore And Bush Where gore won the popular vote but bush won the electoral collage vote. This means that in order to win presidency you must win the biggest states or the most states not the most people.

Another reason is that the Electoral Collage can go against the will of the people. The electors can vote for the oposite canidate than the people voted for. this is because the electors have free will when it comes to voting. Instead of who the people want for president the electors could vote for who they want.

It doesn't make any sense to me because i thought when someone votes, their vote goes straight to the person running. to learn that, that is not the case at all is really an eye-opener about how much politics confuse me.

You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candiddate's electors.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on Abolishing the electoral college! They are not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency.

Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worse.

Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy.) In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have nochance of winning. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters Ohio, they have yet to make it.

Pretty much anywhere you go whether it's school or work, you will hear that as an American Citizen, you have the right to vote. If you don't vote for the president of your choice, you can't complain when things go wrong. Yet your vote really doesn't count unless the electors you voted for win .

How can they say our vote counts when it really doesn't, all i'm saying is that they need to start saying what they mean and stop directing people towards lies.                                                    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Despite some of the risky things that can come along with Electoral College voting ,voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election .Some people therfore think it is useful and some on the other hand think that it is unfair and that it should be changed .

Fortuatntly though one thing that a Electoral College can promise you is a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. It happened in 2000 but it is less likely than a dispute over the poppular vote . For exmaple in 2012's election with Obama and Romney , Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner -take-all basis , even a very slight plurality in a state creates a big elecoral - vote victory .

Moving right along , the Electoral college also can aviod Run - Off elections . The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast . For instnace , Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college . That situation then creates pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral college.

F1C996710DA7,"Many people argue over the fact that the Electoral College is benefitial or not. I'm writing this letter to you Mr. Senator to explain the good and bad effects the Electoral College has.  The Electoral College is a process, it is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College keeps the elections balanced, it keeps the elections organized. It may have some bad effects. For example, many argue that the people's votes aren't what choose the president.

The Electoral College mantains the elections balanced, ""It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast."" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President"", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.

Another benefitial effect the Electoral College presents is the organization of the election for President. As said in the article, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year."" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.

The Electoral College may have some effect that aren't positive. For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Posner, ""Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Voters want to feel involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They feel like the government will choose whoever will benefit them the best and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, ""The Indensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes it's anachronism.

People may have different opinions about Electoral College. People have different opinions about everything. I wanted to explain how the Electoral College benefits our society and how it doesn't. It keeps the elections balanced, organized, but it makes others feel like their vote isn't worthy or valuable. I hope this letter helps you with your opinion and how you feel about the Electoral College.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
9C2E6F09CC73,"At one point, I believed the electoral college was a bad idea. Although, after reading this, my view on the matter as changed dramatically. The electoral college keeps a balance in a country, a balance very much needed. I agree with it one hundred percent.

The electoral college was established as a compromise between election of the President by congress, and election of the President by popular citizen vote. The founding fathers felt it would given congress too much power if it elected the President all by itself. They also felt if citizens chose the seat by themsleves there wouod be chaos. They decided on a nice in between; they both choose, well sort of. What many citizens do not know is that when they cast their vote, they are not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President.

I myself feel this method is great. It leaves room for very few mistakes. The problem with citizens voting diectly for the president can be broken into two categories: uncertinty and underqualification. If the vote were solely based on citizen votes, the statisitcal outcome of the event would be crazy. With the majority of the electoral college applying the winner take all approach, it cuts those numbers down incredibly. It is allot easier to confirm a winner out of 538 votes then it is  to confirm one out of hundreds of millions of votes now isn,t it?

Another thing that makes it hard for citizens to directlly vote for their president is being underqualified. Many people think for themselves and only themselves. They are not qualified to make choices for the sake of the whole country, that is where the electors come in. These are people chosen by state conventions, state party committees, and sometimes candidates themselves. They hear the ideas of the people and manage them so that they are able to help everyone. They are pro politicians whose job in life is to preserve our country

Counterclaim

The electoral college is not of a democracy, but of a dictatorship. The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, ""right"" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.

You are wrong in so many levels sir. the electoral college does not exclude democracy, it promotes it! Every citizen of legal age uses their god given right to express their political preference in the hopes of improving our country. The electoral college prevents regional rulership over areas that prefer one political side. It re-elects every four years to let everyone know, though your thoughts may not have been used in these past times, know that they have surely been heard.

Students, as we know, study and work hard for a career they will accomplish in the future.

When citizens in a community vote for these electorals to have them vote the to-come President, it is an assured weight of stress taken off their shoulders.

I would like to inform you of my place, and arguments for changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

I am in favor of changing to the electon throught popular vote becuase if you really think about it, who is getting a president? it's the citizens. The citizens that are qualified to vote are voting on who they think is going to support us best based on our every day lives. so therefore it should be the citizens choice on who is THEIR president rather than the factor of both the votes in congress and votes of citizens. It should be the votes of the citizens that decide wether or not this person should be elected to run OUR country!

The Electorial College is completely unfair. it basically defeats the purpose of us even voting becuase electors have the power to go completely against what the people say, and a lot of the time they will just because they can. That's the way everything is, the government will do everything in its power to try and to the complete opposite of what the people want to happen.

What the people want to happen is not selfish, it's what they, the people, know what would all around help everybody. But once again, the government will do everything in it's power to do the opposite of what we want to happend and what we know id right for all the people not just a few, or one.

A803835B8164,"Dear State Senator,

This letter of argument is to emphasize why we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are very reasonable arguments for both claims as to if we should keep or abolish the Electoral College. Primarily, the Electoral College is the selection of electors by popular vote to represent their supported party in the official presidential election. There is a total of 538 Electoral College electors and it only takes the majority, 270 votes, to elect the president. It is not fair that the general population does not get an independent vote.

It is not the ordinary people who get to choose the president they want; it is dependent upon which party the elector chooses. Voters don't have control over who their electors vote for. As said in the second article, Al Gore won the popular vote in 2000 against Bush however, Gore lost the electoral vote resulting in the loss of the presidential election. In the past, there have been voters who refused to vote for their party's candidate and voted for whomever. There is also the concern of a tie in the electoral vote.

If that were to happen then there would certainly be no chance that the popular vote would have an impact on the selection of the president because it would now be in the hands of the House of Representatives. The Electoral College is unfair to voters; they do not get the final choice as to where their vote goes. They are not voting for the presidential candidate they want. The voters are voting for a slate of electors. However, there are some benefits to having an Electoral College such as larger states getting more attention from presidential candidates than smaller states and it also avoids Run-Off elections which is when no candidate recieves a majority of the votes.

State Senator, please realize that this is not fair or justifiable. There may be an upside to the Electoral College, however, it is in my strongest opinion based on factual content that this is not a fair method and it should be abolished. Being empathetic for the ordinary voters of the United States would provide clarity for your opinion on the situation. Imagine if you were a general voter who did not get an official vote in the presidential election; you would feel cheated also. This is why I ask you to strongly consider these legitimate words.

0E37E20C3021,"For the vote for the president of the United States, the election should not depend on popular vote, but for the Electoral College. The citizens of the United States should understand that when they vote, they are voting for the Electoral College, and that their vote will not necessarily determine who the president is. The Electoral College should be picked more carefully to avoid ""the disaster factor"", but not completely abolished.

As stated in paragraph 1, the electoral college is a compromise between the congress and popular vote. This can serve as a check that determines the president. Just like children are taught in elementary school about science projects, multiple tests can determine the best result. Relying on one voting could put the wrong president in place, and our country is at stake in this situation. If the president presents his campaign to multiple groups of people, it can show what people want in many scenarios. This can determine what the best choice really is.

In paragraph 9 of source 2, it states how many presidents have wanted to abolish the electoral college. It seems that they all could have one thing in common: they recieve the popular vote, but not the Electoral College vote. I could frankly say that this makes them sound like sore losers, and because one of two parties didn't vote in their favor, they want to get rid of it. I'm sure they might have some legitimate reasons as to why they want to abolish the Electoral College, but I wouldn't doubt that being a sore loser is one of them.

In paragraph 11, the author talks about the 2000 fiasco. Although he makes some good points about the legitimacy of the Electoral College, some points can be made about the popular vote as well. Many people in the popular vote can choose their vote based on things that don't relate to the campaign, and some people running for president depend on it. They will spend their time trashing the opposing candidate which will cause the voter to think ""This president says that the other is bad and I believe them, so i will vote on the person that told me so"". This is just one example of how just like the Electoral College, the popular vote can be illegitimate as well.

Although there are many reasonable reasons to abolish the Electoral College, it should not be abolished so that the vote is based on many trials, rather than just 1. We should carefully select our Electoral College, but getting rid of it could put the wrong president in place for the wrong reasons.

44079A5EEDDE,"Dear Senator,

I would like to take this time into explaining why having the Electoral College is not a good idea in determining who would become our president. Why should anyone be voting if in the article it states

""

It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

If the Electoral College is irrational and outdated, then why do we keep using? Popular voting can be a better idea then using the Eleortial College, with the popluar voting we can the president that makes the United

States a better place to be living in. For the past century there has been war and terroist in the U.S, and the cause to all the violence is because when Senators are suppose to represent our state they say what in their favor. IF we focus on what the people want we will have a better chance of stopping all the battle. People that are serving the armed forces can come home to their children and family, the local news will not talk abou the next war and the disagreement that this country has aganist another.

If we begin to use popluar vote we can begin to have more and more people voting. Many citzens do not vote because they think that their votes do not count or aren't counted. With popular vote they can be sure that they will be counted and that the votes are for the people not for the Senator. As we get older, this country will not ben the same as before or how it was in the 1800's, we are goinmg to start changing the things that we think are best for this country, we do not want to start the same wars we did centuries ago. Improving it would mean to take risk and if we have to change Electoral College to popular vote, then so be it and let's change it.

I suggest for now on instead of using Electoral College we start using popular votings. If there is ever a case where the votes come out teied then we instead on using Electoral College, this would of be if there were to ever be a tired in the voting session. If this country is all in choices of the people and for the people why can we start to use popular vote instead.     ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
7003A818F22D,"Our Founding Fathers created a new concept of a way to elect a President, called Electoral College. This concept was created so voting  would be fair to everyone, since it is a compromise between the election of a President by a vote in Congress and the popular vote of qualified citizens. Electoral College may cause some domestic disputes between citizens, but in turn it keeps our nation running smoothly. The Electoral College helps avoid run-off election(which can be detrimental to our Presidential Election), it requires the presidential canidate to be ""everyone's president"", and it has a certainy of outcome.

Additionally, having an Electoral College helps us avoid the problem of elections in which, neither canidate recieves a majority vote within the popular votes. For example, in 1992 Clinton had only a a 43 percent plurality of the popular vote, but won the majority of the Electoral College with 370 votes respectively. The presure of neither of the canidates winning a majority vote could greatly complicate the presidential election process.

Arguably there is a possiblility of a tie in an electoral vote, since it consists of 538 electors. But a tie is highly unlikely. Every state does not recieve the same amount of electors;electors are assigned given your states population including the District of Columbia. This means that states with a larger population have a larger say than a state with a small population in the Electoral College.

Even though the Electoral College is the most despised method of choosing our President it makes the presidential canidate have a trans-regional appeal. Meaning, the canidate cannot heavily campaign in a region where he knows he is the favorite of all the states in that region. For example, in 2012 Romney was the solid favorite of the Southern region. But he cannot gain electoral votes by increasing his popularity in this region. Since no region has enough votes to elect a president, he would need to increase his popularity in other regions in the U.S.

On the other hand, the Electoral College is outdated and voters do not actually vote for the presidential canidate, they vote for a group of electors. Those electors may betray the party of the canidate and cast their vote for whomever else is running for President. The system allows for much worse to happen. A state could send two slates of electors to Congress,and the Vice President could only validate only his opponet's electors.

In conclusion, keeping the Electoral College is a must. Without it our Presidential elections would be a diaster.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Electoral college process is not a good processs for presidency. While a president can get the majority of the popular vote; on the other hand, he could have the minority of the electoral college votes. That president would lose the elecetion even though he technicallly had the most votes. We should change the process into popular votes for the president.

The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. The article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the Louisana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy).The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election.

The electoral college is a unfair process becausse of the winner-take-all system. In the article called What Is The Electoral College"", by the office of the Federeal register it quoted most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article  ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral  college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.

In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winner-takes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits.

It's a important process to be able to select the electors and the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President. One's of the many reason they should keep the Electoral College is because the voters want to express their political preference. Also, it helps choose your state's electors when you vote. Lastly, voters won't get confused about the electors when they vote for the candidate with this process, they wont.

Starting of with, some people might argue that one vote won't affect the voting and that it does not express your political preference. However, in source three by Richard A. Posner paragraph twenty three states ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference."" People who vote in elections are people who want a change to be made. They give their vote for the strongest and most confident candidate. They don't get mistaken in whom they've voted for.

To continue, Every given time there is a presidential election which is our responsibility to vote in and help choose our state electors. In source one by the Office of the Federal Register says ""You help choose your state's electores when you vote for President"" When we decide who our vote goes to we usually help choose our states electores when we vote for President and when we vote for our candidate we are also voting for our candidate's electors which most people will agrue is the right way to go.

Last but not least, many people would argue that voters get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. In source two by Bradfor Plumer says ""...voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate."" However, it has been proven that mostly everyone does choose for the right candidate! They choose the candidate they see the post potential and confidence in and the one that is going to make the changes they want and need.

To conclude, Electoral College should be kept. Multiple people will agree to this as well. This isin't just a place its a process that people agree to do! This makes us able to elect the most confident candidate that is going to make a powerful change. There are many reason the Electoral College should be kept. Startin of with, the voters and how they want to express their political prefence. Also, it helps us choose our state's electors when we vote. Lastly, voters won't get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate with this process. This is a long process but at the end of the day is worth it.

To start off keeping electoral college is best because it restores political balance that large states can not have. For example the popular vote was close in florida.

For Example, the Electoral College resotres some of the weight in the politcial balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies a majority of the vostes cast.

Furthermore, The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats. But of Course no voter's vote swings a national election American population did vote in 2012 election.

The Electoral College is a process which the founding fatehrs established as a compromise between election by a vote in congress and by popular vote. The Electoral College con sists of 538 electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This is a way of how the votes are calculated in the United States.

I want to change the way that this voting is held. It is not fair for the electors to elect the president. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the swing states. It should be on the peoples votes since they are the ones being affected by the changes. Not by the Electoral College.

The winner-take-all system is not fair what so ever. If there are more votes foe whatever president in that state then the electors will go for that president. This is like bandwagoning for football teams. If they go to the national championship they will change to that team. This voting shopuld change to the peoples votes instead of this winner-take-all system. It is more fair and balanced.

Think of it this way in 2012 that more people voted for Mitt Romney but the electors didnt think so that is unfair. Right? The voting needs to be changed once and for all to a popular vote system instead of the Electoral College. This is the best way for the United States to deal with this madness.

Even though the Electoral College is a despised method for choosing the president it has it's reasons. I'll show you why I am in defense of the Electoral College.

We need a president that would regard all of our interests and concerns. Someone can't just appeal to one region and expect to win because "".. a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president.""(source 3) due to no region having the amount to guarantee the electoral votes to elect a president. Dealing with votes it is a problem to have a run-off election. One of the concerns with Electoral College is that "".. voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" stated in source 2. But the Electoral College simplifies that problem with the electoral votes. Remarked in source 3 it says ""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively.)"" without the Electoral College it would have complicated the election procces but thanks to the Electoral College reduces the complication and produces a clear winner.

To win, the majority of the states have a system that gives all the electors votes to the winning candidate except Maine and Nebraska having their own way of proportional representation which is explained in source 1. This gives the certainty of a result, for example in source 3 it says that "".. even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landside electoral-vote victory in that state"" this makes it highly unlikely for a tie. The Electoral College gives political balance to large states (population wise) higher the population the more problems, concerns ,or interests is needed to be attend to. Like how source 3 says "" .. a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...""

There are 538 electors deciding our country's fate compared to 5 million citizens who have a fair understandment of the presidency. Even though keeping the electoral college may prevent some citizens voting for the wrong person, we still have some smart people who can vote for themselves.

What about the states who only have 1 or 2 representatives?

Wyoming only has 1 representative who represents 500,000 voters compared to California's whopping 35 million voters and 55 representatives.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College vote system, because it is pretty much the same thing as election by popular vote. When you vote for your canidatate, you're voting for his electors. Then those electors vote for their presidential nominee. Not often do the electors betray their canidate, so odds are the popular vote will win.

Also, the Electoral College system avoids run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes, the Electoral college produces a clear winner.

Another reason to keep the Electoral College vote is because if we had to vote by popular vote, it wouldn't be fair to some of the states. Canidates tend to visit the big states that have an impact on their election. That means that the states with a lower population don't get to see what the canidates have to offer.

Next reason is because some of the presidential canidates could be favored by some of the regions. For example, obama was elected as first African American president, and a lot of African Americans were excited, and voted for him. Some of the people didn't even care what he had to offer. The Electoral College reduces the chance of that happening because the regions vote doesn't have a big impact on the election.

Lastly, we should keep this voting system because when the citizens vote for a presidential canidate, they vote for the electors. They choose electors that are going to vote for the party's nominee. So basically, if one of the canidates wins the popular vote, and the electors go to vote, the one with the more popular votes is going to win most likely. It rarley ever happens that the elector for one nominee votes for the other.

I believe we should keep Electoral College vote because it is much like election by popular vote. It is also more fair between big and small populations of states, and presidential canidates can not be favored by regions they come from. The Electoral College system is a good way to vote.

There are many reasons for keeping the Electoral College but the reasons I am going to point out ot you are, certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. There are also some reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College. For example voters vote for a slate of electors not the president.

First of all two reasons for keeping the Electoral College would be a certainty of outcome. Even though a dispute over an Electoral College vote is possible it is more likely to occur iver a popular vote. A reason for this is the winning candidate's share of Electoral College exceeds his share of popular vote. For example, in a article called In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral vote compared to the 51.3 perecent Romney received. Because of the winner-take-all basis even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote  victory.

Another reason would be you avoid run off elections. The Electoral College aviods the problem no one candidate receiving a majority of votes. For example, in the article In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, it states Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the poplar votes, while winning a majoprity in the Electoral College.

Two more reasons for keeping the Electoral College are swing states and big states. The winner-take-allmethod of awarding electoral votes induces the cnadidate to focus campaigning in toss-up states. These voters are more likley to pay close attention to the campaigning going on. They are also more likley to be more thoughtful voters. Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by the mal-apportionm,ent of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.

A reason for not keeping the Elecetoral college is that voters vote for a slate of electors not the president. These electors can be anyone not holding public office. The problem with is htat electors can vote for whom ever they want. Some go against the cnadidate they are supposed to vote for. So voters are chosing the president they want.

In conlcusion please take my reasons for keeping the Electoral College into consideration. Again those reasons are certainty of outcome, you avoid run off, swing states, big states. Also the reason not to keep the Electoral College is voters don't vote for a president, but a slate of electors who do.

In the second source,

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong, paragraph ten states ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" the whole point of an election is for the voter to vote for who they want not vote for someone who might not even stay true to their word.

Paragraph ten of the second sourse aslo states ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office."", ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" How can voters vote for someone who they don't even know? How can voters trust them not to betray them? This system has not been set up to benifit us, it basically makes us give power to the electors and hope for the best. This seems like a shot in the dark.

Paragraph sixteen in the third source says ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" yes it says it rarely happens but there is still a possibility that it will happen, it's inevitible.

297F3F4B6B58,"The Electoral College shows many reasons why we should change it to popular vote. Like for instance The Electoral college is not fair, but by voting with popular vote not only will more people vote but more people will vote for who they want to vote and not get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.

Theres many reasons why the Electoral College isnt fair like, how Bradford Plumer stated during the 2000 campaign a variety of states that didnt vote because of not being able to see a campaign ad and they did that because some candidates dont focus on the states that they know theyre not gonna win. But by voting with popular vote you get to vote for who you want, everone gets to vote because every state would be equal and people would vote for the president and not for the slate of electors.

yes, maybe the Electoral College could be good for something for like winning. Also if you think about it, it could be worse like even worse than the 2000 fiasco election, and plus the Electoral College avoids run-off elections so thats a good thing if you want a clear winner.

Other than that popular vote is much more sufficient than Electoral vote because its much more fair and with popular vote everyone votes on who they want to vote and every state gets the same, equal treatment as the others.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
54AB7FB037B1,"Dear Florida State Senator,

I belive that we should change the way presidents win the election. I dont think it sould be based on what the House of representatives and Senators think. It should be based on popular vote by the citizens. After all, isn't about what the people want.

What is the Electoral College? ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place.""

(Source 1, section 1.)

It was a compromise between congress and the citizens, formed by the founding fathers. In the Electoral College there are 538 electors. Just over half of the congress has to agree for one, to be elected President. In the end it doesn't matter what the citizens want. Who ever gets more votes in the Electoral College, wins presidency.

Why do I not agree with the Electoral College? I do not agree with the Electoral College because, for example take Al Gore. He would have on won presidency by citizens popular vote if it hadn't been for the Electoral College. ""Over 60 precent of Americas voting population, would prefer a direct election.""

(Source 2, section 9.)

I also belive it isn't fair to smaller states. Electoral College is based on your states population. You have small states like Alaska and Hawii who only have 3 or 4 electoral votes and other larger states like Texas and Florida who have 29 or 38 Electoral votes. The candidates running for president go to large states more so than small states, because they know that if they persuade the big states the will the election. ""The Electoral College may turn off potentail voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state.""

(Source 3, section 23.)

This causing not alot of people to vote in larger states.

Overall the Electoral College is not a good method for electing the Pesident. The Electoral College is unfair, non-useful and outdated. Its sad because everyone who votes, thinks that their one vote matters. News flash, because of the Electoral College it doesnt matter!                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
AAA72CBAC7F8,"Dear State Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME and i am an American Citizen. I already know about The Electoral College and its process. I know it has 538 electors and 270 of the electoral votes are needed to elect president. Along with that, I know that our founding fathers developed it in the constitution and their chosen by the candidate's political party. But i do not know why so much people bash The Electoral College when its a good thing. Based on my research, The Electoral College should stay and should be used everytime in an election for President.

To Start off, most people think of The Electoral College as a non-democratic method of selecting a president based on Source 3: by Richard A. Posner. Its is a non-democratic method because its the electors who elect the president not the people. Based on Richard however, ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed"". Its possible to win the electoral vote but not the national popular vote. It happened in 2000, with Gore when he was running. But that was the first time since 1888.

There are some flaws of The Electoral College however. According to Source 2: written by Bradford Plumer, voters vote for electors who elect the President not the people. No one really knows the elctors and they cant be seen holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors and voters cannot always control whom their electors vote for. In addition, as Bradford said ""voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidates"". These disadvantages may want to make people disapprove of The Electoral College disregarding its advantages.

There are five really good reasons for keeping the Electoral College. Based on Source 3 the first is ""certainty of outcome"". This basically means if the winning candidate's share of the Electoral votes is high most likely his popular votes will be too. The next reason is that its everyone's president. Like Romney he only focused on benefiting the one region and the Electoral College had no favor in that and as a result he got no gains from them. The third reason is ""swing state"" like Richard calls it. The ""toss up states"" are the ones who really decide the election. Voters in those states pay more attention to the campaign since they are the ones who will decide the outcome. The last two reasons are the big states and avoiding run-off elections. A large state gets more attention from Presidential candidates in a campaign then a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candiates receives a majority of the votes cast.

These five reasons make the electoral College what it is now. Most voters dont watch the Presidential campaign's and chose whoever. The Electoral College is fulled with educated people who actually take the time and watch and study the campaign's so their vote is the vote that makes a difference. Despite the Electoral College's lack of democratic pedigree its still should stay.          ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
9A09E549C46B,"The Election by popular votes for the president of the United States is what I'm am arguing for. Having a president by the people who vote for him/her will make everyone happy& make everyone more comfortable. Having this argument is being done for all the people that agree with me. We as American Citizens should have a say so in who we chose as president. Good president, bad president. Either way, we should decide. It's only fair.

If we all voted for the Electoral College, voters would not vote for the president, which would make most people discusted. Another thing, say you lived in Texas..and you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. They would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They're could be anyone not holding public office. It depends on the state who picks the electors, anyway.

There are fives reasons for retainging the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree. All are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. one of the reasons is, ""certianly of outcome."" Example, in 2012 Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to Romney's 51.3% of the popular votes. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but its highly unlikely.

Another of the five, ""Everyone's Prseident"",No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. A candidate with only regional appeal in unlikely to be a successful president. So why only use certian votes?

That is just a couple reasons why I am arguing today about Electoral College Process. I certianly disagree on the Electoral college.

THIS SUCKSSSS. Lol                                                                             ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FA6AF2AFC743,"Dear state senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME and i am here today to talk to you about wether or not you should keep the Electoral College. In my opinion i thibk that it would be easiewr to vote for the president by the number of popular votes that he recieves. In this letter i am going to explain to you why i think that its easier if we do this so please make sure you can read through this whole letter.

The first thing we need to know before starting to read this letter is that the Electoral college is basically a widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democractic mehtod of selecting a president that ought to be rules. Many people in the United States and in other places all over the world always face difficulties wether or not they like the Electoral College. If you acually think about it, in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for the slate of the electors who then vote for the president. So the people that are voting for these electors are not getting the direct vote. They are not getting sufficent amount of power to vote for the person that is going to rule their life.

A very important key that we asll have to know is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters. Candidates dont spend time on states that they know have no chance of winning. People cant put the fate of the presidency in the hands of a state that only have candidates because the candidates know that they might have a chance on winning!! And i do understand that we cant change this because some people dont like it but that is because people do not understand what the Electoral College is in the first place.

So dear mr.senate please do something to abolish the electoral college. Its is unfair and irrational. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter and dont hesistate to call me whenever you need to.

83998F1D3F9F,"The Electoral College is a system of appointing electors. These electors vote upon who will be the next president. Citizens/voters believe that they should be the ones able to decide who will become the president. People claim that this system should be changed to the ""popular vote"" system. This system is based on the people's votes. Even the smallest of states get their say in who will take the presidency. This form of electing should be put into play. The Electoral College should be abolished. It is interfering with citizen's rights. It is irrational, and should be changed.

Untrustworthy is a word used to desribe the Electoral College. It can not be trusted. In some cases, the college is said to have chosen a candidate based upon themselves, not their state. An example of this appears in the election of 2000. In this election, 17 states were said to have never even seen the candidates. Voters said that they didn't even see campaign ads. This could have been caused by the college. The Electoral College is unjust.

A new case appears on 1960. In this case, Louisiana tried to recieve new electors who would go against J.F.K. Their electors weren't going with their beliefs. This is just one example of the injustice. Voters everywhere feel the college is unfair. They would like to have a greater role in the outcome of elections. They wish to feel more a part of this country.

Others say that the Electoral College should stay. They believe in five reasons for the acceptance of the system. One reason is the ""certainty of outcome."" The second reason is ""everyone's president."" This is saying that the college needs a presidential candidate to have appeal. This means that candidates need to not only campaign in popular states. Doing this makes the other states feel discouraged and feel as if their votes are not important. The next reason is due to the swing states. This is saying that they need to focus their campaigning on small, ""toss-up"" states. Next reasoning is due to big states. They say the college restores and manages political balance. The last reasoning is that the college avoids when no candidate gets a greater amount of votes. This is saying that the college is able to break any ties between candidates.

Despite the reasonings given by the opposing side, the college causes problems. It is limiting voters' freedoms and rights. The voters want to be a part. They want to help their country. They want to be there to partake in the election and to choose their president fairly. The college is unjust and confusing. With the college, you do not know if you are getting the candidate that your state had voted for. The accuracy of your vote could be questioned. For these reasons and more are why we should change the system. We should remove the Electoral College system and replace it with the ""popular vote"" system. With this change we are ensuring the accuarcy to our voters. They will be able to take full part in the electoral election process. They will be able know for sure who and where their votes are going to.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

B4D91520B347,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is widely awknowledged for serves a purpose as a method of selecting a president and vice president, not a legitimate college. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between having the President elected by a vote in Congress and an election by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This process of choosing a president needs to be modified into popular vote for the reasons that the Electoral College was established to actually vote a slate of electors, voters feel disenfranchised, and is unfair to voters.

To begin with, the Electoral College was actually established for voters to vote for a series of electors, which then get together to have the final decision. Stated in ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, "" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise...process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" This means that under this system, voters don't vote for the president, but for electors who then elect the president. The voters sometimes aren't told full front that they are chosing someone else and not always can they control who their electors are voting, leaving many puzzled. Voters aren't to be puzzled. They are to vote who they'd like because it allows them a freedom to express who they want because they are strongly awknowledged of the troubles of their society and how they should be handled.

In addition, the Electoral College makes voters feel discouraged and disenfranchised. According to ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, it is stated, "" No region...has enough electoral votes to lect a president...residents of the other regions are likely to feel...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" This means that voters feel that the presidnet they chose is their president because they believe their votes count.

Futhermore, the Electoral College is unfair and irrational to voters because the candidates they ""vote"" for don't spend time with them. Sizes matter to the candidates. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, it is stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates do't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" This quote conveys that because some states are small in population and size, they will not help the candidate succeed. This is immensely discouraging to the voters because they feel worthless for not being big in size. Candidates should not have an excuse to not thank all their voters because every vote counts, not matter how small.

Admittedly, the Electoral College allows a clear and certain outcome because it exceeds the popular vote, however, the method is actually turning off potential voters for a candidate. The popular vote allows every voter to express their opinions because the overall vote chooses the puopular president.

In the final analysis, a change is needed because with the Electoral College many candidates are losing potential voters considering that the qualified feel that they arn't doing much by voting considering they aren't voting for the president, but a gamut of electors to vote for them. They alos express the feeling of discontent and unfairness because they feel that they don't count and know they have no chance at winning.            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens. That should stay remain the same they should not be any change to the Electoral College system.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorals. When the electors have a meeting thats when they are able to for the President, Vice President that is running for office. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, majority of 270 electoral vote, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Each candidate that is running in the election has their own group of electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The voters help choose their state's electorals when they voted for the President, when they vote for the candidate they are actually votin for the candidate's electors. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the efforts the candidate put to win the election like the campagin.

The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner- take-all that awards all the electors to the winning presidental candidate. After the presidental election the state governor will prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" that which list all the of the candidates that ran for office, along with the names for their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winner of the presidental candidate of your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the offical records of presidential election.                      ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I think the best way to know who wins the election is by the majority votes to the candidate.

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The voting system should be done like specificly, because if you setup different things it's not going to work at all. It depends what kind of setups you are making. But I think it's not the good way to make voting system in setups.

Each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The singal best argument against theelectoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky for the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sysytem allows for much worse. Consider that state allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elecrtoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of the Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the singal representative from Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the representative from California. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's seletion can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say thsi, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral; votes by increasing his plurity in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable resuly because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicians in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by the popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

My only suggestion is to do the votes through the majority voters to the candidate because any kind of setups are not going to work. And the people are not likely going to believe all that stuff. It's kind of hard to do that but, it will going to work.    ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1F20EF428962,"The electoral college is a time worn system. Some people hate it, others defend it to their dying breath. The electoral college is no longer a good way to select our nations' leader because the power no longer rests with the people.

Through the electoral college system, we put our votes into the trust of strangers who may or may not decide to vote how they want and completely disregard our voices. Plus with all of the corruption in government as it is, it wouldn't be the most difficult thing to buy a voter off and potentially change the outcome of the election. Or the electoral college voters could end up clueless or untrustworthy, as Bradford Plumer, Source 2, paragraph 10, points out: ""Can voters always control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."", proving the point that the people are not in control.

Granted there are a few small benefits to the electoral college. It usually prevents the confusion of ties inside states, and, as Source 3, paragragh 20, Richard A. Posner says, "" Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""

The problem with the overwhelming power given to the swing states by the electoral college is that it does not represent the American idea: that no one group of people is in control, that everybody has an equal say in the matter. When a state like California votes for a candidate, that candidate immediately has an advantage from the start. And all the people in California who voted for the other candidate are not heard at all.

Corruption is, again, a major problem with most politics, including the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists nearly replaced all of the democratic electoral voters in Louisiana with voters who would instead oppose John F. Kennedy, and potentially cost him the election. But while a small group of people can be bought off and turned to vote against the majority, it is impossible to corrupt the American people. It would also cause candidates to have to pay more attention to the smaller states and the states that the candidate thinks they will win over automatically due to their current party.

The American people need the power to elect their leader back in their hands again. The electoral college was a good system years ago, but with time comes change.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

06A2C91F38FE,"Dear state senator,

After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not effecient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy. Although defying the people does not happen often there is still the risk of repeating history to a greater extent.

Continuing, the ''winner takes all system'' causes states with smaller populations to be ignored. According to source 3, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention. In contrast, it can be argued that no single region can shift a campaign greatly, nonetheless a single voter`s vote.

The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for canidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States.

Please take into consideration my proposal,

F146498328DC,"Is the Electoral College fair or not, thats is was many people are trying to figure out. The Electoral College is a process of votes that allows people to choose a president, but some contries get to vote and some dont even see a campaign ad. I believe the Electoral College is not a fair process because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president, also the winner-takes-all system doesn't rely on the states that have no chance of winning but relies on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

There are many things wrong with the Electoral College that can ruin the vote system for a long time. According to Source 2, under the Electoral College the voters dont even get to vote for the candidate they want, but have to vote to a slate of electors which is unfair. Voters sometimes cannot contol who they vote for so voters sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. It depends on the state to pick the slate of electors on state conventions, or even by presidential candidates themselves.

The winner-takes-all syestem can be very unfair to some states who want to vote for a candidate. The winner-takes-all system is unfair because the candidates dont spend time on those states that have no chance of winning, but relies on the states that can win. 17 states including  Rhode Island and North Carolina dont even get to see the candidate because they are states that have no chance of winning. Also 25 large media markets dont even get to see a campaign ad because the candidates dont bother to but one up. The fate of the presidency is in the hands of a few voters in ohio which is just unfair to other states.

I believe that the Electoral College is unfair because they have done many wrong things that can effect other states and the vote system for a very long time.              ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
678A6C5DE012,"Dear State Senator, I propose that we change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States rather than having the Electoral College. I say this because the Electoral College is unfair to voters in many ways more than one.

I'll start off by saying that Electoral College is unfair to voters. I strongly agree about this because under the electoral college system, voters do not vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors, who then elect the president. This system is unfair because you don't always know who your electors are and you can't always control who the electors vote for. If you can't or don't know who they are voting for, then how can we trust them with the fate of our country? Although us people don't always make the right decisions, at least with popular vote we would all know that our votes wouldn't be put in someone elses hands.

To continue my agruement, the Electoral College is also unfair in this way. Say if there was to be a tie in electoral votes, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. Then the state delegations would vote for the president and the Senate would chose the vice president. When this would happen you would then not know who they were going to vote for and what your government's fate would be. So again if we had election by popular vote this wouldn't happen.

Lastly, the Electoral College is unfair to voters by the winner-take-all system. Since there is a winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. An example of this is back during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't get to see the candidates at all. Some of the largest media markets didn't even see a single campaign ad. This is completely unfair and ridiculous to all potential voters.

In the end, I think that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and ridiculous. With all the valid points and arguments I have made, they make a pretty good reason to abolish the electoral college.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think we should banish the Electoral College becuse we the people decide who the president is not  Electorals. We should just go back to basics and have a normal vote system. This system is no working for our needs so we need a better and direct voting system. One big example for leting go of the Electoral college is the disater factor and it just unfair to voters.

The electoral college should be cancelled because there are too many things wrong with it. Like one is the winnner-take-all sytyem, by a couple of votes off and one canidate takes all the points in that state. So with that, canidates will use mostly of he's/her's attention on big states to get all the big points there. And little states see little to no campaign ads for any candidates because of the electoral college.

Then swing states help us in the electoral college with dividing the points to the cadidates.

Help with the winner-take-all system, it just the oppisite of it. Also the electors rarely betrayed the voting. Then the are times where the candidate wins the elctoral vote, then loses the national popular vote.

With all of this infomation the Electoral College should be descarded because it is a non-democratic method and it just an anachronism. And when you are voting, you are voting for electors, not the priesident. And which candidate wins the popular vote wins the election. its just unfair to the voters because they dont really vote for the priesident.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
07D075719A6D,"I believe that there should be no more Electoral College because it doesn't give people much of a say in who becomes President because there is just a commitee of people that are voting for the President. ""The Electoral College established by the founding fathers in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (Office of the Federal Register, Para. 1). The Electoral College only consists of qualified citizens it elect the President, so even when you vote the majority doesn't even matter because the President is only elected by those qualified citizens.

A lot of people prefer to have a different way of voting than we have now. ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but, still lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now"" (Bradford Plumer, Para. 9). This shows that more that half the country doesn't want the closed election, they want a direct election.

Some people still say that the Electoral College is a good thing because they think it is a fair way of voting for President, but even if their vote doesn't really matter they still think it is a good thing to have for our country. Also if they vote for a canidate who has the popular vote and still loses because the Electoral College voted for a different person, they might think that it is unfair, but they still think it is a good way of doing things.

All in all, we should do away with the Electoral College because it is an unproper way of voting for the President and also can be unfair. It is unfair because it doen't give people a say in who should become President. If the person running for office has the majority vote and still doesn't win, it shows that the people of this country don't really get a say in things that are important.

There is a big controversy between the issue of keeping the Electoral College or abolishing it. Some people say that we should abolish the Electoral College because it is unfair or outdated, and others agree with the idea of having electors choosing their party's nominee. The Electoral College should be abolished because it is unfair for the states with smaller populations, and the ""swing states"" don't get any attention during the Presidential Election.

If we look at the statistics about the Electoral College, we see in the article ""

What Is the Electoral College?

"" by the Office of the Federal Rigister, it states ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors"" and ""A majority of 270 electoral votes."" Your states number of electoral votes is based off of your states population, which isn't fair to smaller states such as Hawaii or Alaska. Hawaii has four electoral votes and Alaska has three electoral votes, while the larger states like California have fifty-five elecotoral votes.

The way that our country today decides our winner in the Presidential Election is the ""winner-take-all"" system that gives the all the votes to the winning canidate. In the article ""

6B0402639A88,"Dear state senator.

I think that the electoral collage should be changed because it makes voting unfair, more people would vote,and it would be more effective.

The electoral voting system is unfair because your vote dosnt really count if the majority of the votes goes to the opposing party. It would be more even if your vote counted directly towards the party rather than voting for your states electors. I also feel that more people would vote because with the state electors your vote wont matter if the majority of is oppiste of who you voted for.

Also, other people would vote for other parties more rather than just the democratic or republican parties because the majority of the people are just gonna vote for those parties.

If the votes were not for the state electors and for the president than George W. Bush would not have been elected and the majority of the votes went towards John kerry so that wasnt fair for him.

Also every states number of electors is different, if they are going to have electors per state I think it should be the same amount for every state because if more of the states voted for the republicans but the democrats could have had the states with the larger amount of electors and won the election. The tinier states wouldnt do much for the election if they only have three electors. Also without electors voting, there would be a less chance of there being a tie in the election. It might make counting the votes easier but voting would be more effective if it was without state electors.

Those are the reasons why I think that the way voting is should be changed and hopfully someday it will be.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
08CC837C9EC3,"The Electoral College is full of debates, but the biggest debate is if they should still have power. They should not stay in power becuase The United States of America is a democracy. Its is easier and more democratic if the candidate won by popular demand. What is a democracy good for if the Electoral college can change their choice of who becomes president. Many of the representatives in the Electoral College are unfair to voters and sometimes cheat the voting system. Would you want that running your countries choices? I dont think so.

The voters choose a canditate in the electoral college but they can always change their votes. For example, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" stated in source two. Basically, If you want a republican president to win you would vote for a republican represetative of the electoral college, but thats not always the truth. Voters can not control the mind of a representative, in a few seconds they become of member of the oppsoing sides and thus they have your vote. This is known as unfair use of your vote that can obviously not be taken back.

2000 was the the year many people realized the lies of the electoral college. Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Electoral College states that ""Al Gore . . . won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This means that the electoral college is cheating the voting system and lying to their voters. So, do your votes even matter? No, not really. ""Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now"" said by Plumer. This system we have for voting is basically useless to us and just gives the electoral college more power to run us.

The Electoral College does have some good reasons its still in power. In source three written by Richard A. Posner, he states that "" . . . the pressure of the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" In other words, when there is a run-off election or tie, the electoral college brings down this pressure making the choice so its quicker to make a choice on who becomes president. Sadly, very few people find the Electoral College useful but they do do a lot of things that help make the elections easier on the voters and putting less pressure on the candidates.

In the past few years people have realized what the Electoral College actually does. Its is true to believe that they grab our vote and change it last minute. They also can help in the process of the presidential election, but they make the voters confused and get called unfair adn cheaters, which is true. If this country was truely a democracy then the people would have complete ownership on who becomes president not the Electoral College.                 ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

If the Electoral College stays then what's the point of having the citizens vote if it means nothing? The winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote .

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to transregional appeal. There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. Democrates in texas and Republicans in California know their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.

12C119C37C62,"America's government was inspired by the Athenian republic, therefore giving the United States  their way of governing today. In a republic government, it is said that the people of the country hold the power of electing their leaders to make decisions for their nation. In the United States of America, the presidential election is held every four years. The eligible citizens in every fifty states are granted the right to vote for their desired president. The process of which these votes are counted is called the Electoral College. The way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate.

Initially, the process of which the president of the United States is elected should be changed from the Electoral College to the most popular vote because it will produce a more accurate percentage of votes. In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer states, ""And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured is a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Being that there is a lesser number of votes counted in an election due to the Electoral College, there is a highly greater chance of the outcome resulting in a tie rather than showing a clear winner. If the election was based off of the most popular vote, there would be a higher number of votes for each candidate, therefore reducing the chances of ending in a tie. Secondly, in the article, ""What is the Electoral College?"" the Office of the Federal Register wrote, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President."" This statement shows that the Electoral College requires more than just the majority of citizen's opinions. If  at least half of the population votes one way, there should be no question about who is the winner. The most popular vote system would award the candidate that was favored by at least half of the population, therefore providing a clear and fair election. Clearly, the most popular vote sysytem would significantly benefit the American Society.

Aditionally, the process in which the President is elected should be changed to the most popular vote because it will provide the opportunity to directly select and individual's desired candidate. In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer quotes, ""Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" Richard A. Posner states, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America.

In summation, the way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate. The Electoral College does not provide a fair result nor a clear winner. The most popular vote system would significantly change that for the better of the country.

This make people feel better to vote then doing it another way. So want u like you vote to go right in so you know your vote count?

The only con of doing this is we don't know who did it. You want think that really matter but it does because some can cheat for somebody. The state legislatures been picking electors since 1960. In Kennedy days when he was running he got cheated out his vote,so he lost but they done fixed all that things going well.

This is five reasons the keep the method of voting like that.#1 fact there is a certainty of outcome by that i mean it show the popular votes.

He/she can't play sides like her cant just do the most for the south havt to be fair fot all of them.#3 swing states by sayig that the winner-take-all.

There was a huge debate over the 2000 election where Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College destroys some of the integrity of the Ameican democracy. I believe this is due to the winner takes all system of the Electoral College.

The Electoral College says whoever has the majority of votes in a state recieves all that states votes. I believe this corrupts the system because so many peoples votes go unaccounted. If one party has 51 percent of the vote the other 49 percent of the votes don't count. This is why I believe that we need to abloish the Electoral College.

In a true democracy the people vote for a president and the ideal behind the Electoral College is that it eliminates uneducated votes. I believe that it doesn't do this very well and may actually harm the system even more. Peoples votes elect electors who elect the President in the Electoral College system. These electors are put in a spot of significant power. The question is who are these electors. It is very possible that they can vote for the opposite party of that which they were elected to vote for. Scandals like this have occured in the past what is stopping them form continueing in the future.

Another major problem of the Electoral College is with the winner takes all system if a state is known to be a majority one party or another there is no use for someone in the minority party to vote because they have no effect. This allows citizens who are supposed to help elect Americas leaders to be unable to have any say in the goverment. The ideal behind a democracy is that the people rule and the Electoral College is destroying the democracy because it is restricting people form taking active particiapation in what they are entiltled too as a citizen.

With the Electoral College, your voice isn't really heard. Votes should be counted individually and America will get the president that they really want.

For starters, there was a situation back in 2000 where Al Gore won the popular vote but didn't become president. That my friend, is unfair. The Electoral College doesn't really prove who actually won. Although, the incident happens back in 1880, I don't think it should happen again. Most of America wouldn't really think of the president as the president. I must admit, the Electoral College is a quick way to send in the votes on election day but it isn't efficient.

Like stated in paragraph 10, voters don't vote for the president, but for the state of electors. The electors are basically anyone who isn't holding office. State conventions, state party's central and presidential candidates can pick the electors. Votes can't always control whom their electors vote for which why you should get rid of the Electoral College. Plus it's a dumb name.

Another reason why is because the people of this country will be pissed if another Gore vs Bush situation happens again. Electors are really in control, therefor if they dislike who's running against their political party they have a shot at voting for whomever they want. That's unjust, and frankly unfair. Especially if a huge state is at risk.

One counterclaim might be that the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves the majority of votes cast.

I don't want to vote and wonder if my voice will be heard. I want it to be guarunteed because that's what the United States is all about. It's all about us being able to choose the president.

Many people think that this method is flawed becuase the people are not electing the president. On the hand people think that the Electoral vote keeps the race for presidency with a more clear outcome, than if they were elected by the popular vote. There are defiently two different arguments to this points with both sides involving good evidence.

There are many flaws that people bring up in regard to the electoral vote. One of these is that since the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, the electors could easily defy the will of the people. The most obvious fact about the electoral vote is that you are not voting for the president, but for a group of electors who then vote for the president. This is also unfair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they know will not win. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not even see the candidates, and people in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. In turn the elctoral college is unfair and outdated.

Electoral Colleges are very important and should be in every ""state"". Electoral colleges are where electors go to meet up and vote for president and vice president. This is a great help because they are more educated in politics than the average citizen is. With the knowledge in politics they can be trusted to make a good decisionon who to vote for.

The Electoral College has five hundred thirty eight electors. Each state has an elector for each of the members in the House of Representatives. Not only does each candiddate running for president have their own group of electors, but you will get two of your own. The electors are very hard working also. They have to count all the votes made by congress. If the Electoral Colleges aren't in Florida then who else would want to count all of the electoral votes congress. No one has the time to do that unless it's in their job description.

Although an Electoral College can cost a lot of money to build they are still worth it. The bulding of the college will also be beneficial because it causes more jobas for the unemployed. Electoral Colleges are fundamental and will help improve the state's current voting system.

In my opinion I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we should change because under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elects the president. for example, if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for John Kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.

nevertheless the electoral colleges dispute over its outcome is possible, it also nrequires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, its winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes does induce the candidates, the electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed on the constition, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

the electoral college method of selecting the president is and will turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. according to the gallup poll in 2000, 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election the electoral college is losing the little defenders it has and due to the spurious arguments the electoral college should be abolished.

Every one has a voice and they all want to be heard. The Electoral College is an unfair method of calculating votes for the population while voting for a president of the United States. States begin to feel like it is not worth it to vote because their vote could be neglected or it would not hardly count. Electing presidents by using popular vote gives states a better advantage at choosing their president because they know their vote is in and someone else will not be able to change their choice. Popular vote is when all the people are allowed to vote for the president and every vote counts because based on the amount of votes the president recieves from the people is who wins the election.

Electoral Colleges are when the people vote for the person they want to govern them and that vote goes to a person that could either decided to vote as the people choose, or vote for whom ever he feel should run. It lowers the peoples voices, they are unable to directly choose what they want because their choices could be changed. Electors don't have to vote infavor of the person you would like. The diffrence between the Electoral College and popular vote is that in the Electoral College their are electorrs that can choose to vote in favor of what we -the people- want if they agree with it. The elector doesn't have to choose what the people want. In popular voting, the whole population gets to choose who they want as president without worrying that their vote will be put aside. It makes sure that we -the people- get what we want. They could just change the vote and choose who they want to run as presidency. The Electoral College doe shelp the counting of the votes because there are only 538 voters; however, we are in a diffrent time where electrical machines can help calculate the total number of votes for a large population.

Citizens with the right to vote feel like it is not needed for them to vote because the have a low number of electors, while having a large number of population. It would benifit them if instead of having a certain number of electors that you have to ""trust"" and hope they vote for the candidate you are going for, they will be able to directly vote for them using the method of popular votes to chose the president. The citizens will know that their vote counts and that it can't be changed because they wont have electors voting for them.

Popular vote gives the citizens freedom and it helps to better calculate what the people want. The United States is a nation that is governed by the people and is runned based on what we want. It wouldnt make sense to deprive us from our voting rights. The constitution states that this goverment was created by the people, from the people, for the people and allowing us to vote by popular will help reinforce this because it will give us the freedom and liberty to choose as we -the people- want.

I would honestly choose the popular vote because it also puts a suspence on people about who will win.

0096700783B5,"To just put it bluntly, the Electoral College is a huge waste of time and pointless processing. It is completely unfair to the voters, who most of the time feel as if they're voicing their opinion for no reason since it doesn't even get taken into consideration. The whole concept of the electoral college in it's entirety is irrational.

Some people want to be part of this country and participate in one of it's biggest most known events, choosing the president but with the electoral college in our way like a stone wall preventing us from voicing our opinions makes it slightly impossible. Although I must state that the Electoral College does help avoid run-off elections according to source 3 by Richard A. Posner, parahgraph 22. This country is practically split into halves, meaning if two canidates won by popular vote but each had around the same percentage of votes the Electoral College would choose an obvious winner avoiding run-off elections and not complicating things further. That still doesn't change the fact of how unfair it is to the voters.

""Abolish the electoral college!"" said by Bob Dole in source 2 by Bradford Plumer. Yes I agree, abolish it, tear it down to smithereans, bury it into the ground never to resurface again. The electoral college is like planning a family trip, the youngest sister wants to go to Ohio while her brother wants to go to California, they tell the oldest sister of these two location ideas and the sister goes off telling the mom to go to New York, completely ignoring the other two suggestions. In this scenario the two youngest children are the citizens while the oldest sister is the electoral college, thus making the electoral college irrational, injustice, and unfair. It can be argued that the electoral college does help in some aspects like the certainty of outcome described in source 3 by Richard A. Posner, paragraph 18. But some certainty doesn't go a long way, there can be various faults in this certainty.

In my very argued opinion the electoral college is an outdated system usually old men like to stick to because they're afraid of change. Change is good, especially change that can pave the way to choosing better presidents and giving citizens more of a voice in our country, some of us just need a little nudging. Get rid of this annoying process, in with the new and out with the old.                                                                                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

ADA2D72FCD40,"Keeping or changing the Electoral College would be something to carefully process out. Since the Electoral College is ""regarded on a non-democratic method of selecting a president that to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner""(10), then there should be a change made towards it. If there is ever a presidential election then there should be a fast process to organize each votings. As Americans have the freedom to choose, there shouldn't have to be a problem going on. To keep any confusion from starting, whoever's encharge of declaring each voting method has to keep the rights of each voter. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politicial preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (23).

Making decisions can't be easy most of the time. People have to cautiously think about which will best benefit. Everyone goes through that stage when they are stuck on  a decision. It's normal. We all know that the most powerful people are stumped on any decision too. Freedom of speech, freedom of mind. Sometimes, each state will have different opinions on voting; everyone is different. What people have to remember is that America is a land of freedom and that they have to choose wisely on certain things or else the country will go downhill fast.

""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational""(14). It's not allowing the voters to actually ""listen"" to what each candidate is saying. People should have the right to vote based of what they think. It's almost like the feeling where someone is forcing somebody to do somthing that they don't want to do. As if they have no other choice. It will be best if the decision-makers start thinking about other people's thoughts. Not everything is based off of one certain process.

I believe that we should keep Electoral Colleges but massive changes to the system.  These changes would help prevent ties, avoid a large number of ""swing"" state, and also make elections easier.  For one to prevent ties, that is a hard thing to prevent cosidering we have no control over who someone votes for but it can be solved. If, in case of a tie, we due a tie braker as you will.  There will be a revotation process with 499 voters, these voters are picked at random in the city data base.  ""...for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him.""

Number 2 is to solve swing states, again this is something it is hard to prevent but can be solved.  There needs to be an equal number over information distributed among the states and so forth.  For the conclusion of making elections easier, we need to make the more convenient. It takes a long time to vote for you and could be faster.  Although the electoral system is slightly flawed we still need to keep the ""peoples"" president, and there are not manyn other ways to do this than to due the system we have now.  The only major problem is the the system is out of date.

0FADC137B8B7,"Dear State Senator,

I feel a need to adress that changing election by popular vote for the president of the United States over keeping electoral votes is, in my opinion, better for the people because it brings the U.S's people together in many ways.

The people of the U.S deserve to make great decisions like these, on account of the fact that us, the people, make most of what we have in America today, and though we work hard and may have fights sometimes, we still make choices together,voting being one of them, and this unifies us even more. Allowing this will bring a sense of unification . We already consider doing selfless acts just to make peace. Example: Our taxes pay doctors', polices', etc. salaries. We at least deserve to decide who enforces laws.

Another thing, to begin this reasoning let this question be asked: What is the government doing right now, this very moment? Who really knows, for sure? Not us. The people of the U.S really haven't an honest clue what's really going on behind the government, so it wouldn't be too wise for us to entrust the government into completely making every decision, decisions in which we could perfectly make ourselves. So it not only gives us, the people, a sense of unification, it also gives a sense of direction so that we feel that we are not being blindly controlled by the government.

To commence the third reasoning let another question be asked: First, say for example that you work a double-shift, full-time, day and night just to keep food on your childrens' and wifes' plate, clothes on their backs, and a roof over their heads. When the bills roll in, your paycheck isn't won't arrive for weeks and you still haven't enough to pay, so you may have to work overtime if possible or pick up another job. No one gets rich off the government clearly, and yet we work so hard to just make it. Now here's the question: Doesn't it all feel worth it when the paycheck come in? Okay now for the deeper question: What is the sense or feeling you specifically get when you see you happy families' faces? Now for the point: Our work pays off. We work for the government (at least most of us does) together, whether to put bread on the table or otherwise. Now wouldnt it give us that sense of freedom that us hard workers get to make great decisions like these? It would. All of these things bring us together more than we might even think, whether its families, friends, or just us as a nation.

To conclude all of the reasonings of arguing to change election to popular vote for the president of the U.S which are the sensation of unification, direction, and freedom, I'd be obliged to state that this is just one thing that finally unifies and brings the U.S's people together. Those three senses that this gives us is a seemingly small, yet great difference. And even though most don't realize it, it's definitely there.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The people of the united states will now have a bigger impact on the state that they live in. Doing this not only makes the people happy, but it also makes the people more involved. With this new rule in place many things can change and improve. People will actually have to do a little research before voting on a president.

Firstly, Changing to election by popular vote for the president can cause a chain reaction. With this new rule the people of the United States will be forced to do solid research before making a vote that will benifit them. Reason being that with this new rule in place your vote is much more crucial then it was before. Doing this stops people from voting just because they like how someone looks, or because how they dress. The people will be voting because they want a president that will help the country. Using this method will improve and shape the country in an wonderful way.

Lastly, this new rule will cause more people to come out and vote. Because each vote will be ten times more essential then it was before. People come out knowing that if they dont vote, it will have a much bigger impact then it did before. The people are forced to decisions. This make for a healthy country that is made for the people.

Dear Senator,

Im PROPER_NAME, writing you to ask if you could change the Electoral Collage, I'm sure I'm beside hundres asking for the same. Instead of voting for our slate of electors, we perfer to vote for the president himself. I have reasons, I will be glad to sure them with you.

In my opinion, I believe the Electoral collage is not fair. The bigger states get alot more electoral vote, So it's obvious if the president wins all the bigger states their going to win. The way I see it, is that the little states don't matter, or they aren't as important, since they got little electoral votes. For example, If I was running for president my main goal would be to win all the bigger states first, like; California, Texas, Florida. With them three states I already have 122 electrol votes, Thats when I'll start focusing on getting my other 148 votes by winning the little states over.

My other reason why myself, and hundres would rather vote for the president himself be, because of the mistakes of voting for the wrong canidate. Remember in 1960, Hawwii sent two slates of electors to Condress? What will happen?If you think about it anything and everything could go wrong!

Lastly,Voting for the president himself would be easier, You along with others in your range would not have to worry about the electoral votes. Not only that it may also be less stressful, and crazier. Voters like my parents would not get confuse for voting the wrong elector, and giving her vote to the wrong canidate.

In conclusion, I honestly think not having the electroal votes would be best for our voters. I'm sure the candidates would enjoy us the voters making the mistake and voting for the wrong elector, since at the end of the day the Canidate is the one getting the vote, that wasn't meant for him. Instead of voting for our electors, why won't we vote straight to our president?

Change is not always a good thing. The Electoral College being changed is definetly not right. Many may be persuaded by fleeting emotions into a strong desire for changing the Electoral College. This however isn't as good an idea as people may think it is. It's unnessecary to fix something that isn't broken.

The Electral College so far as been working extremly well. Its a benificial system that our founding fathers created. The Electoral College has kept balance and silenced the chaotic voices of the citizens. According to source 3, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" This is a fact because the human mind is fragile and tends to let anger or ego get the better of them. This will then be the cause of uneeded casualties.

A lot of people find the idea of changing the Electoral College to be satisfing. In thier mind's this will make things more ""fair"". Source 2 implies that, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Many will believe this because their not able to see the big picture. The Electoral college as stated in source 1, ""is a process, not a place."" It's not about being unfair or cheating. The electoral college is valid system that has allowed the election of a president to go as smoothly as possible and it is in every way superior to the popular vote method.

So let's be realistic and leave things as it is. Comparing popular vote to the electoral college is like comparing a newborn baby to an adult. The fact of it is that the electoral college is the more reasonable method to use whereas popular vote is unreasonable because it'll only give birth to more problems.

Electoral Colleges are big parts in the presidential elections, but I don't think we should use them anymore, I think we should elect our president by popular vote.

Why should Electoral Colleges not be used anymore? They should'nt be used anymore because as it states in paragraph 10, source 2 that "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Meaning that who you vote for goes through the system and then if all the electors felt like you did the electors would give the votes towards that candidate. But if they didnt feel the same way as the majority of the voters than maybe another candidate would end up with more electoral votes.

Another example is the 2000 elections, Al Gore recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266, it says in source number 2. If the majority of people vote for one person, why does another become President? It doesnt seem fair to me, if the people vote for what they want they should get what they asked for.

In the diagram in source 3, it shows the amount of votes each state gets if you look at the difference in the numbers you can see why this is not fair. For example Rhode Island has only 1 vote but California has 55, if the whole state of Rhode Island votes for the same candidate and only 51% of California votes for a Candidate, who do you think the upper hand willgo for? Oh yeah! California's vote. And that goes for a lot of states, half of the country can vote for the same president but they have a small amount of votes and California has 55! Its not fair at all.

Even though you're most likely aware of this, as the United States,we are currently using the Electoral College system as our voting process. This system should be abolished due to all of the factors that could go wrong. The Electoral College is a multiprocess system, which can confuse some of the voters. As an exapmle, there could be a case like this, ""Is it Robert Peterson that's the elector for Jacqueline Smith, or Peter Robertson?"" With uncertainty like this, we can't be sure if our leader was intentional or an accident. Some other confusion that can occur within electors is that they might say that they're going to vote for Jacqueline Smith, when in reality they are planning on choosing Henry Harrison. Another negative is that They often only visit swing states so they can over rule the large state. This isn't fair to other smaller states who may need the candidates motivation. Last, but luckly least possible, is that the number of total electors is an even number. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point of being a tie, but it will be a possibility for as long os the Electoral College is standing tall.

An alternative process to this current system would be Popular Vote. This would solve all of the problems listed above. If the election process is done by popular vote, there will be no confusion because it will all be done individually. An aditional plus of the direct voting being more straight forward is that the voters won't have to worry about whether or not the elector will vote for the candidate they want. With Popular Vote, the candidates will have to visit many more states in order to reach most potential voters, this is because they will see that the poeple of their party is spread all over the United States. There will also be less of a chance for there to be a tie becuase the voting is based per person, and with a bigger number there's less of a chance for the votes to be split evenly.

Hopefully after this being read, there will be a change to the current voting system the America.

I am writing to you about the debate on the abolishment of the Electoral College. I see absolutely no point in the Electoral College because all it is is elected people from a state voting on the president based on what the popular vote for the president was in their assigned area.

The Electoral College has 538 electors. The majority of them are from the states of California, Texas, New York, and Florida. Election Day is held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. I don't see why we need other people to vote for us. The Bill of Rights said that we have a ""freedom of speech"", but our ""freedom of speech"" is given to other people to change around. We need to abolish the Electoral Congress so we can just vote for who we want!

The popular vote means that the president who recieved more votes claims that the state voted more for him/her. The popular vote goes to our ""electors"" and they decide to vote for the President. We should just vote straight up because the election in 2008 was a huge mistake. Obama decides to do whatever he wants. Insurance prices have gone up due to ""ObamaCare"", and now there is a huge, long, and exhausting process to get te see a specialist especially if you need to see one. It is out of control and he needs to do something about it.

We should abolish the Electoral College because its just a waste. All they do is tally up the popular vote, and say ""OK, im going to vote for Romney since that's what my people want.""  Why can't we just vote for who we want instead of wasting our time! The popular vote should be the only way to vote. There shouldn't be a long and hard process to voting.

The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of electors where they vote fot the president and vice president. It also includes the counting of electoral votes by congress.

To begin with, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required for a president to be elected. The number of electors in each state equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One for each member in the House of Representatives and plus two for the senators.

I personally believe that not only our state, but our nation would be better off using the Electoral College voting.

Yes, some other citizens might go against this claim, but they don't know what it's all about.

The Electoral College voting system has been around for a while

What is Electoral College?

by the Office of the Federal Register states that ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" Which proves that it's been around since the beginning of America's establishment. The process of Electoral College voting consists of the selection of the electors (the people who actually get to decide on the vote casted.) Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution the District of Columbia is treated like a state, and is ""allocated 3 electors"" for the purpose of voting. The voting can be considered fair because ""each candidate has his or her own group of electors"", generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws can vary that determine what or who the party consists of. Some voters may believe ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"", from

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer Which brings me to my next point.

It all comes back to the voters. The represenatives from each state represent the voters from the sate they are chosen to do so. The voters vote on them. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, represnting 500,000 voters would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million"", also from

I'm sure the states don't just choose random people, because the people that are elected by the state to vote are also from that state, and they are normal (more thoughtful) voters, who deserve to decide. ""It can be argued that the Elecoral College method of selecting a president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope in carrying their state"" for example Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California, ""knowing that their vote will have no effect"" but that's their call the VOTERS call, if they don't want to participate in the voting it's partially their fault the candidate they favor doesn't get selected.

The Electoral college process consits of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consits of 538 electors. A majority of electoral votes is required to elect the President. The passage also states that under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. for this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia,

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a ""Winner take all"" system that awards all electors for the winning of thhe Presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a Variation of the ""proportional representation"". After the presidental election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" lisiting all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate also declares the winning of the presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of electors each year.

The electoral college is widely regartded as an Anachronism, a non-democraric method of selecting the president that ought to be overruled by delcaring the canidant who recives the most votes the winner. each partt selects a trusted elector to vote for the parties nominee.

04B2FF7FB176,"Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. If the people are indeed intitled to their opinion and they ahve the power how come the USA has yet to even talk about changing the electorial college process. If the people do infact get to vote for which ever President they want, then how come the people vote for someone to vote for them, not even considering that that person that they voted for just might defy the will of the people and choose the other candidate.

The single best argument against the elcetorial college is what one might call the disaster factor.''Back in 1960 segregationist in the Louisiane  legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the new Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote to Kennedy would not actually go to Kennedy)''Source 2. That saying the electorial college is very eassy to minipulate. ''Faithless'' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and caste a deciding vote for whoever they plaese. What that just means is the people who voted for that pearson might as well just vote for the opposing side if the electors are going to do that.

In Addition what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress again?''Vice President  Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so without establishing a precedent''Source 2. That could very well happen again, by mistake the stae could send two slates to congress and than we would be right back were we left off.

In Conclusion the electorial college should be no more instead of that we should be able to vote by popular voting . The people should have the power not the people voteing for someone to maybe or maybe not have the power for them.                                                                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I believe that we should let our nation's President be chosen by popular vote. The Electoral College is a wondeful idea don't get me wrong, but it seems as if with the Electoral College, the candidates running for U.S. President are just getting free votes and could defy the will of the people.

When a candidate runs for office, aka Presidency, it means that he also has to choose his electors, but sometimes the state picks them. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. So when a voter wants to vote for their choice of candidate, they would have to send their vote for a group of Democratic or Republican electors that are pledged to your candidate. If your candidate won the statewide election, then they would go to Congress and your candidate would get however many electoral votes that he recieved from winning. ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor,"" according to Source 2. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy, (so a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"", according to Source 2. Some electors occasionally refused to vote for their candidate and wanted to instead vote for some who they actually want to vote for. Another worrying factor is if the Electoral College had a tie. If that were to happen, then the election would be given to the House Of Representatives, and then the state delegations vote on the president, and the Senate would choose the Vice-President.

By the electors defying the will of the people, then the wrong President could be elected into office. If a majority of state voters wanted a candidate to be President, but the electors thought differently, then they could be unfaithful and vote for whoever they wanted to. Where would we be then? ""Most states have a ""winner-take all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate,"" according to Source 1. Some states, like Maine and Nebraska each have some type of ""proportional representation"". The reason I believe that we should have a popular vote is because you never know with the Electoral College. One minute they could be voting the way they should be, and the next they could be going against the will of the people and the state overall.

Overall, I think it we should rely more on ourselves than the Electoral College. It was a fantastic idea, but the electors could change their mind in a split second and who knows who could be going into office instead of the President we actually need and want to run our nation for the next four or more years.

52F671887530,"Dear Senator:

Over the years, people have been disputing over the Electoral College. Some people want it abolished while others want it to stay. The Electoral College is not working and and it needs to be abolished. For many reasons, the Electoral College has not worked. It is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. According to source 2, :""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The whole point of voting is so that you, along with many people, can decide who will be the next president! Voting for people to elect a president is just not right. It causes voters to not vote because they know that their vote really won't matter. Source 2 also states that candidates don't spend time in small states, ""focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" That is causing smaller states like Rhode Island and South Carolina to have less knowledge on the candidates. If I didn't know too much about a candidate, I wouldn't vote at all! Even though people in those states did vote, they might not have known a lot about the candidates and voted for the wrong person.

The people running for office want to win. Source 3 says that someone could have a higher popular vote but lose the election. Is that fair to the candidate? Winning the popular vote but losing the election? No, it isn't. Winning the popular vote means that more people want you in office. If the majority of America wants a certain person to be the president of their country, that means that the winner of the election would be the majority vote. The Electoral College denys that basic right of Americans by not letting them choose their president. That alone is unfair to the candidates and to the voters.

Now you might be saying that the Electoral College has worked for a very long time and shouldn't be changed. Although the Electoral College has been working for a long time, that is the only thing that America has tried. If America used the popular vote, it could've changed elections. The Electoral College hasn't been working because it is causing more and more voters to stop voting and it is making it where only the majority vote doesn't matter. Citizens of America should have the right to chose the president by majority vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates. As an American citizen, you have the right to vote. The Electoral College is taking that away and it needs to be stopped.

3188A9E2D162,"Some people believe that the electoral college should be abolished and some people believe that the electoral college has helped us throughout the years. But I believe that electoral college should be abolished.

The reason I believe that the electoral college should be abolished is because I don't believe it is benefiting any elections at all. And a lot of people do not believe in it either. In source two Bradford Plumer said ''what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce been trying to do, abolish electoral voting.'' I think that the electoral college makes the president elections to close to tie, and that could be a catastrophe. However source three has made some pretty good points on the electoral college. Saying that '' if there was no electoral college there would be no winner-take-all system.'' this would a terrible problem for the canidates and the voters, and would ruin the whole election.

Therefore sources two and three makes some pretty valuable and good points, but I still think source two makes more sense to me. In source three Richard A. Posner wrote '' it is the electors who elect the president not the voters. When your voting for a president canidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. I dont agree that electors decide what we voted for, because then whats the point of voting for a canidate if your not even choosing at all. America is a democracy and having someone choose your president for you is not showing that we live in a democratic nation. We need to choose so we can learn from our own mistakes and then we won't make them again.

This just shows that the House Of Represenatives and the government don't trust us at all and that we cant make good decisions. Source one doesnt say anything about being against or with it but it did point out some interesting facts about the electoral college. The office of the federal register wrote '' the electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.'' What their saying is that we might not have huge say on the election but we do have a pretty big say on it. I don't that we have any say on it what so ever, and that is because of the slate of electors.

In conclusion, I agree with what source two had to say because of the great points they made and the facts that led me to belive that the electoral college does not work at all. Read the sources and then tell me if you think i'm right or wrong.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
12BB75BB1FDF,"Dear, Mr. President

I need to get something off my chest, we need to change the way we the people vote. An Electoral college isn't the right way to do it anymore. We need to change to the peoples popular vote. Because this is a country for the people, we aren't voting for the president, and because electoral vote just isnt't fair.

Mr. President the first reason why we should change the popular vote is because this country is supposed to be for the people and in an electoral vote it's not. In the electoral vote its about the government and who they want as president and alot of people DO NOT like that. People of the United States of America should be able to vote and pick who they as a president of there country. It should be our right as Americans to be able to pick our own president not a bunch of old smart people in suits in Congress. I under stand that there is 538 as it says in the article What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register, but their is more than 300 million Americans.  So techinically we aren't even voting for you.

Which brings me to my next reason, we aren't even voting for the president. When there is an Electoral college we are voting for the slate of electors in congress that will vote for the president as it says in the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the systems are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer. So like I said before a bunch of old men and old women are they taking our votes away from us. For example, in 2000 Al Gore would've won the election but because the electoral vote beat him. He had the popular vote of the people but says the congress chose other wise he lost the election. According to the same article as it says above. Over 60% of people rather people's popular vote other the electoral vote.

Last but definetely not least, the electoral college just isn't fair at all. Maybe it's fair for the government befoore they can basically just pick the president that they want, but it's supposed to be a country for the people. It says it in the Constitution

We The People not

We The Government . Also the winner takes all system, the candidates don't pay attention to the smaller states they just look and the big states like California, Florida, or New York. So technically they are cheating the electoral college because they don't pay attention to all the elected slates of those small states. According to the article "" The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong"" by Braford Plumer.

In Conclusion, Mr. President if you care about what the people want you would abolish the Electoral college. Because this is a country for the people, we aren't even voting for the president, and because it's just not fair. It needs to be changed to the popular vote. I've been waiting to get that off my chest for a while.

I personally like the idea of having the people themselves vote because the electors could change their mind and because it makes more sense to just vote for who you think should be president. As of right now i dont really care if it changes or not because i dont vote for another 4 years.

First, ""Whats wrong with electoral college"". one reason to pick electors is because its less people to keep count of. Having these electors is another step in the voting procces but it keeps things going easier. In conlusion, i dont agree with this, there is almost nothing i can think of that is good about this, unfortunutely.

Secondly, The great points of having the people themselves vote (which i agree with). One reason, is that electors can change their mind and vote for whoever they want and it could completely change the election. Secondly, This requires the president to go to all states exculding no one! This way all states feel equal and they feel like all of their votes matter. Another great reason is that they focus more on toss up states where people tend to pay more attention. Another good reason, is that bigger states get more attention. This is important because he can reach out to more people rather than a smaller state.

In conclusion, I think having people do the elections themselves is the better option. I hope you can come to agree with me.                                                       ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

After reading this article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" I've come to believe that we should keep the Electoral College because, look at all the rights and goods we have establish untill now. What im trying to say is that the Electoral College do work, for example This method is widely regarded as an anachronism. Also that it can still be a elcetion, ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the election vote will not win the national popular vote,"" so I believe its fair on both sides. It happen in 2000, with Bush and Gore where Gore had more popular votes than Bush but less electoral votes, and we all know would won that year.

The Electoral College do has it cons for example, the voters actually vote for a slate of electors and not for the president. So if you live in a state like Texas for example, your votes goes to 34 Democratic electors that you don't know and this can create confusion about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The best argument about the electoral college is the disaster factor. It happen once in 1960 where ""Louisianna legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who oppose John F. kennedy,"" Which means that those popular votes for Keenedy would not actually gone to him.

In despised of the Electoral College cons, here is five reasons of keeping this method of choosing our President. Certainty of Outcome, Everyone's President, Swing States, Big states, and Avoid run-off elections. With these five reasons the electoral college allows us to ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution...""  also you can say that it has been working for as all as it has been here with us, so why abolish something if its working.                                                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College are the votes that elect the President depending on the majority votes.

To begin with, the Electoral College should be kept since it induces the candidates. for example, to many of candidates are running for President. People don't know on who to vote on. The Electoral College eliminates most of those candidates. "" Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates.""

Furthermore, the Electoral College should be kept since it restores some of the weight that large states lose. For example, since there are big states, there is political problems in what the people want. Large states have a lot of voters. The Electoral College should be kept since it restores weight to the large states.

Finally, the Electoral College should be kept since it avoids the problem in which the candidate recieves the majority of the votes.

Do you think that we should keep the Electoral College? We should keep the electoral college because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state ad shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascentainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Abolishing the electoral college! According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore,Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

The single best arguement against the Electoral College is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It's official: The Electoral College is unfair,outdated, and irrational. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachronism,a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular vots the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. The first reason is certainty of outcome. The second reason is everyone's president. The third reason is swing states. The fourth reason is big states. And the last reason is to avoid run-off elections.

It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election [source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our dispised method of choosing president].

A8683674019F,"Dear Senator

The Electoral College was created by our Founding Fathers. They put this in the Constitution to make electing the President of the United States fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. The Electoral College should not be changed no matter what. To go against the Constitution would be to go against the nation, for we were built on the leadership of our Founding Fathers and the guidance of the Constitution. This Contitstution was created so that the people have more power than the government. So I strongly believe that the Electoral College should stay the same. It is the governmet that needs to change. There is nothing wrong with the Electoral College, it is just the ones that run it. So if there should be any change, it should be the government that should change, not the Electoral College!

The Ectoral College is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and by the popular vote of the citizens. When the voting starts the electors come to a meeting place and vote on who they want as President. After the meeting, there has to be a majority of two hundred seventy electoral votes for the election of the president. The electoral College is as I have said it before is fair and equal to all the citizens in the United States. To take this away now would be a catastraphe, because that would mean that all the other presidents in the past would not have even been our Presidents, the history behind them would be rubish and not even true. Some states may have a ""winner-take-all"" sort of thing but they are together and voting together as on state. Some of them may vote for the other one but the majority of them is for one person. Some of the states believe that it is not even worth it to have a ""winner-take-all"", because they think it is unfair. Then after the presidential election comes the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which is a list of all those who ran for President and there respective electors.

The electoral college has been around ever since the Constitution was created. It may be unfair now, but if there would have been any changes to the Constitution it would have been done then instead of now. The Electoral College was probably a great idea when the the Constitution fisrt started out. Then the years have gone by and now we want change. Well I see that the Electoral College can be unfair but it is also fair in it's own right. Because of the fiasco in the year of two thousand about the abolishment of the Electoral College, it has left a scare in our nation about the government, because you guys are giving out the information on the candidates to late or not at all. That SUCKS, for most states because they may not even get one advertisment about the candidates any where or even a commercial on T.V. If the vote for the abolishment of the Electoral College does happen, then there is nothing that I can do about it, but you can still change your ways. You can make it fair and not irrational. Even send the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" earlier than you have done before now. This is a nation of freedom and peace, how are you trying to keep the peace with other countries if you can not even keep the peace within your own?

The government is the real problem, not the Electoral College. It may be unfair, because the majority of the people may have chosen one person while the electors may choose the other. Then when they add it together it is there vote that counts more than the peoples. If the government had only done the right thing and elected what the people wanted, then no one would have a problem with the Electoral College. It is stupid that the government is listening to what we have to say but not hearing it completly. The Constitution is a document of equality for the people. Not the government. If our nations democracy is a democracy then they should listen more to what the people have to say and not what the government has to say. If the government would do this then things would run more smoothly within our country and there would be less conflict.

This nation is a nation of freedom and peace. Not for a bunch of people who are power hungry. The Electoral College is fair and equal, it is the government that is not. If the government would only change for the better then there would be no problem. This nation is still young compared to all the other countries. They have gotten all there issues taken care of, but we have not. The reason is that some of the officials are power hungry and do things to take care of themselves and not others, but some are not and they want to make this country better. Those are the ones that should stay and not the power hungry ones. They make it fair. So I strongly belive that the Electoral College should stay the same, and that the government should be the one to change.

There is a lot wrong with it, such as having to trust people to be honest and vote the right way, or simply just discrediting a state because of it population.

With the electoral collage, you are to have state representatives. Your state is to take a majority vote and relay that information to the state representatives. Then the state representatives will then vote according to how the majority persuaded them to vote. However many things can go wrong with this they can simply vote their way or like paragraph 10 states, they can get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.

Due to the fact states have electoral votes based on size and population that one vote could cost the election. on the other hand, the electoral vote are very unfair. i believe everybody should have their own individual say so in elections.

Some of you may believe that this saves time, but in reality everybody has to vote anyway. in fact it takes more time by deciding state representatives and so on and so forth. i really couldn't think of any other reasons you would want such a corrupt system like thus one. this system is obscured.

Also America always preaches against discrimination however they still portray it. the have discrimination against some states because they lack people. however some states choose to lack people so the don't have to become an industrial state. they may want to maintain that farm state feeling. farmers tend to take up a lot of land pushing people away. frankly we still need farmers. just like we need a new system.     ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FB3004826640,"Many people have been asking themselves the same question, ""Should the electoral college stay or go?"". Having the electoral college is not a fair way of choosing for presidency. People want to vote for a president, not a slate of electors to have them vote for the president. Some people worry about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Changing the way we Americans vote is a fair way for citizens to see that their vote truelly does count.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Accoriding to

Source 2 , ""Having the winner-take-all system in each state, canidadtes don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focus only in the ""swing"" states."" Seventeen states didn't see the canidadtes at all during the 2000 campaign and some of the largest media companies didn't get to see ads for the campaign. That was a way for people to change their mind if maybe the canidadte did visit their state. Citizens in their state shouldn't be voting for someone else to go vote for president. People are into the idea of choosing the right leader for our country, so having the popular vote shows what people think on the canidadtes.

People do worry about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If this does happen we know that the House of Representatives will take charge, where state delegations vote on the president. Since having the electoral college, each state shows only one vote, so for example, 500,000 voters represent a state and then having 55 representatives from another state, who then represents 35 million voters is not a fair of choosing a president. And the House's selection can hardly be expected to represent the will of the people. Bradford Plumer states in

So maybe changing to popular vote instead of having electoral college is a good and easier thing.                                ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
AE3CD422AAF4,"The President should be chosen by popular vote. By letting the people choose who sould be their President they are able to get what they want, not what Congress thinks they want.

The Electoral College system is old news and now that we are in 2015 there are all sorts of new things going on. The Electoral College system is just too much and seems like a hassle that can be made easier by having qualified citizens vote for their President.

Under The Electoral College system voters are voting for electors who choose the President for them. I feel that the people should be able to put in their votes and the man (or woman) who has the majority of the votes should be the President. I am aware that choosing the President is a big deal but by doing this, things are much easier and more efficent.

What I am trying to say is that the Electoral College system is way too flawed and complicated to be good for us. I feel as though the Electoral College system is unfair, and irrational. Electors have been known to refuse to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever. Richard Nixon validated only his oppenent's electors as well. People can take this system to advantage easily and obuse it to get what they want.

By choosing the President through popular vote it is very difficult to mess up the amount of votes for one person. You can keep supervision on the voting stands and make sure nobody puts in more than one vote for one person and also monitor the people who sort the votes. People are very selfish and only think of themselves and thats why you shouldn't have other people go and vote for the party's canidate. The Electoral College system was made when thinking out of the box wasn't a good thing. The Electoral College system is unfair for voters and outdated.

9C6A5CA37B5F,"Dear senator,

Imagine it being the year for choosing for a new president for the United States of America. You cast your vote, for which president you thought that would be best to run our country. After, you hear the results you become very disappointed , Because the presdient won not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. You become very angry and fustrated because the president that will now be running for America will not better our country by the things he said. Reasoning, that  he won by the electoral college and not by popular vote, and you feel as if you dont feel as if it was not fair because you're not really choosing based on the state laws and how the electors are selected. How would you feel if you were in a situation like this ?

Furthermore, i think we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. My reasoning being said is because when the president wins by popular vote it's from what the american citizens want, not what the electors chose. When you choose by popular vote you also avoide many other things from occuring. For example, the electoral college is a method of selecting the president that may turn off voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. As explained in the text ""  voters in presidental elections are people who want to express a political prefrence rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.""

Moreover, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Canidates dont spend as time in states they know they have no chance of winning, and only focusing on the states that they do. As said  in the text "" In a 2000 campaign , seventeen states dont see the canidates at all, including in rhode island and south carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. Making that hard for the people to see what there president wants to do for the country they have no idea because of the canidate too worried on winning and letting the citizens choose.

To elaborat on my claim, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The disaster factor is what happened in the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis in a century , which allows the system for much worse. In the electoral college state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and those electors would effect the will of the citizens. sometimes ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever thet please."" Making another reason why the electoral college should'nt be here to stay.

Although, keeping the electoral college may not be a good thing to do.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Some people in the America are worried about the voting for the president. Some people are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, and other are in favor of channging the voting system to popular vote. Going in favor of Electoral College has only one good favor like in Source 1 it says that ""The Cerificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent oyur state at the meeting of the electors in Decemeber of the election year.""

In the Electoral College there is somthing a bit unfair, if on of the presidential cadidate went after the bigger city's like Florida,Texas,or California (as showed in the picture in Source 3) the would have a big lead in the race for one of the cadidates. If one of the presidential cadidates got all three of them then it would be like a win-win for them. After they got those three it would be that hard to go after which ever state he want to get to vote for him.

Even though Electoral College is a good way popular vote would give a clear vote on who would win the presidential election. If we went with popular vote it would just matter on the people's vote on who they woluld want in the White House. If there is a tie, then the should find one person off the streets and ask them who would they want to win the presidential election. All they would have to do is give him a piece of paper with both names and he would pick one. If the state went to popular votes then Obama and Romney would most likely had a closer race then what it was. In Source 2 it says ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct electin to the kind we have know.""

But know that you know some people in America don't like the Electoral College and saw what they had to say mabye just mabye you will consider changing how we the people ofAmerica vote to choose who we want in the White House.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I strongly disagree with the electoral college for many reasons. For one, if our votes can be over powered by the elctoral college, then why even bother having an election. Also, its all of our election we should all have a say without it being over ruled by a small group of people. And lastly, even if we were to have an electoral college. Mke all votes equal it is extremely unfair to make evry citizens vote equal to one vote and the senators equal to two votes.

First I'm going to talk about why theres no point of even having an election. Well whats the point if almost every U.S citizen takes time out of there day to vote and pay money to do so when at the end when they count these votes there only going to go by what the electoral college says anyways.

Secondly, who even came up with this idea... Having the whole country vote for somone then letting 200 something people determine if there votes are correct. Its an opinion and it should be majority rules.

Its is the dummest thing Ive ever heard and my baby cousin could of set up this system better then you guys.

And lastly, why the senators votes shouldnt count as two. Well unless ther super human or some type of god there just as important as anybody else who voted.

Therefore, I hope you take this into consideration and how after reading you know how unfair it is to keep the electoral college in the U.S.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

We should not use the Electoral College, because it causes confusion and mostly anger. Sometimes when the Electoral College elects one canidate, even though he got less popular votes, he can screw up the whole system.

Some people do not understand how the Electoral College works, and they become confused as to how the canidate with the least amount of popular votes could become president.

Most people get angry and then the crime count rises, because some people absolutely do not want a certain canidate to become presdient, because of the things they were told, and that they researched about the canidate. When the canidate they voted for doesn't win the election even though they had the most popular votes, they go on a rampage, and do things that they wouldn't normally do, out of anger, because some people are extremely political, and they cannot help but to start problems in their community.

For example, many people think that Barrack Obama in screwing up the American unity and way of life. Like trying to ban guns, which are legally gufted to us under the 2nd Amendmant of the Constitution.

On the the hand, sometimes the canidate with the most popular votes can be the worst if he became president. I believe that the American people should be given all the facts sp that we can at least help the Electoral College make the decision of who shall become president.

Sincerly,

54DE9CAB7083,"Sometimes things need to change but not in this case. Im in favor of keeping the Electoral College, normally in situations like this you have to choose one way or the other. Not with this, the electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote as stated in Source one. I know that wasnt enough to convince you so let me explain my reasons why i think we should keep the electoral college. My reasons are certainty of outcome and it can avoid run-off elections.

To begin I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us certainty of an outcome. One of the reasons why this is possible is because there is a total of five hundered and thirty eight votes and thats an even number so it can happen. Many people might say what are the chances of that happening. Well it actually happend a few years ago back in two-thousand. One of the reasons for this as stated in Source three paragraph eighteen is ""that the winning candidates share of Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote."" As an example from the article Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis. I hope that this information has been able to push you to my side a little more but were still not done. This is one of my reasons why I think that we should keep the Electoral Vote.

Finally I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it can avoid any run off elections. This is good because it solves the problem of elections in which no canadite recevies a majority of the votes cast. Some people might try to convince you and ask you what are the chances of this happening and has it ever occured before? Well I can answer both yes it can happen and it has twice, ounce in nineteen sixty eight with Nixon and a second time in nineten ninty two with Clinton. Both had a forty three percent pluarity of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. Also some people might argue that the Electoral college might turn down potential voters. But knowing the vote isnt going to effect anything, such as Republicans in Texas or Democrats in California they have less incentive to pay attention to a campaign then to care if there president were to be picked. As stated in Source three paragraph twenty three ""this is why voters in Presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote can decide an election. Hopefully this has convinced you to keep the Electoral College. This is my final reason why I think that we should keep the Electoral College.

I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it gives us a certainty of an outcome and also it avoids run off elections. I know there are alot of decisions to be made and many things to consider but without this Electoral College we are in big trouble and more problems than you can fathom are going to happen. But in the end this is your decison hopefully you make the right one.

ACC450A0C964,"The people, the people, the people that's all you ever hear presidents talk about. ""I care what's best for the people"" or ""It's the people's vote"", if that's true though then why do we still have the electoral college. The electoral college is a creation of our founding fathers and yes it might have worked then, but times have changed. The electoral college is now just taking away the people's votes, has the 'disaster factor', and because of the electoral college many canditdates only focus on swing states.

To start, if it's all about the people then how come our votes don't count. Instead of voting for the president we are voting for who the electors vote for, if they even follow what we say.  Although the exerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" disagrees with me, in paragraph 18 they give the perfect example to prove my point. In the 2000 election of Gore and Bush, Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but still had fewer electoral votes. In other words the people voted for Gore, but instead we got Bush! So if it's all about the people of this great country then why did we not get our choice of president.

Next, the 'disaster facter' is described in source 2 otherwise known as the excerpt from "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"". In paragraph 11 it talks about how in 1960 the segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature tried, and nearly succeeded, in hand picking electors who they believed would be opposed to Kennedy. So what if next time do they succeed and the vote doesn't go the way the people want. As if that isn't enough reason, also in 1960, Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress! Luckily, President Nixon saved the day or that could have been yet enough fiasco the electoral college created.

Lastly, when canidates know for sure they don't have a states vote or even that they do have a states vote they tend to not visit those states. In source 3 it says that it makes them a more successful president because they don't only have regional appeal. However, it also makes it so they aren't connecting with every regional only the swing states so what about the states that are for sure to one canidate do they just not get to hear from their future president? The idea of an electoral college is making it so only certain states get to talk to the canidates and that's not fair.

In sumamary, why do we need the electoral college if all it does is cause problems. You could say that there's less of a chance of the larger states over powering the ones with less population, but at least then it's in the peoples hand what happen. The electoral college takes away the peoples power, has the disaster factor, and the canidates ignore certain states. All in all the electoral college is causing more problems then we need, let's finally make the election the people's vote.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
C2A49B846D05,"Dear Senator,

Every four years, citizens of the United States ages eighteen and up, gather at local voting locations to elect the President, our government leader. From Washington to Obama we have always elected our leaders as such. The Constitution has given us our way to vote- the Electoral College. This process, of course, consists of our 538 electors, the place where they meet to vote, and the counting of said votes. But how effective is this process? Honestly, I believe the Electoral College should be diminished.

Statistics show that direct voting is preferred by the majority of the citizens in the U.S.. According to a poll taken in 2000, 60% of voters would rather direct voting over the current system. With the current ""

winner-take-all

"" concept in most all states except Maine and Nebraska, many people find that even if 45% of all the votes in the state are for one party, all of the votes go to the opposition. Citizens may as well not even vote under this standard if they wont even be represented.

Although not one vote will decide an election if we had direct voting, many single votes can. Take the 1.4 out of 3 million people in California who voted one way and got all their votes thrown the other because of the other 1.6 million people. With that 1.4 million, mixed with tons of thousands of voters, one party may actually win the election rather then the canidate who would have won with the Electoral College process. For example, in 2000, George W. Bush won the election and most of the Electoral College votes. However ,

Al Gore got the most individual votes. How can that be fair at all?

When ""we the people"" vote for the president, we are not actually doing what we have come to believe. In reality, we are actually voting for representatives called

Electors to vote for the canidate. These electors cast their vote depending on the votes that we (you and I), cast. These electors that we choose are generally very trustworthy and reliable, being the reasons we choose these government officials to elect our government leaders. Sadly, however, not everybody is who they say they are, as we all have flaws and sins; occasionally one of these electors will be unfaithful and vote for the canidate they deem fit, instead of who we have chosen ourselves. Although this is rare, the possibilities would be negated completely if we simply had direct, individual voting.

To wrap up, I vote that we abolish the Electoral College and allow the citizens of the United States to vote for ourselves. It would make the majorty of the U.S. happier, it will make us better represented, and we will be directly electing our own government officials. I believe that we should amend the old ways and evolve and adapt to newer, better ways, as we always have in the past.

Thank you,

CFA59480F8C5,"One method of chosing a President is having an electoral college here in the U.S.A.  That means, the people vote for a group of electors. Not the candidate running for President. In that group they count in the votes and elect witch candidate would win.

There are many people that do no agree with this method. One should be able to put in there vote straight to who wins at an election not send it off to a group of people that one does not know. It's part of the list of rights the people should have. Any one can be a elector. In the past, an elector has change there candiate. so instead of who a person's vote going to who they voted for... it would go to the other candidate. Not everything hat should be right in this world is.

The ""winner-takes-all"" system is when all electors are awarded to the winning presidential candidate. This helps when it comes down to what is fair and what isn't. When Obama got 61.7 percent and Romney only had 51.3 most electoral votes were on the ""winner-takes-all"" basis.

Yes, it's true. Not all state has the same number of electoral votes. But that is just because not every state has the same population as one and other. If every state got the same amount of electoral votes, them it wouldn't be fair. North Carolina doesn't have the same populations as Texas. it wouldn't make sence to give them both just 3 or both 38.

There should be a change in the Electoral College. It should be changed to electing presidents by popular vote. It is our right to vote for someone who would actually make changes in our society and make our lives different. The fact that we have to vote electors for those electors to choose our president, it seems unfair. Also, the purpose of voting for president is for everybody to vote not just citizens. Therefore, there should be some changes for voting.

To continue, election of presidents by popular vote should be used in the United States. If we are voting for presidents, then why should us ,citizens, vote for electors in order for them to vote for our president? As stated in source 2 ""The Indefinsible Electoral College"",""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state,candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing""states."" In addition, it states in source 3 ""In defense of the Electoral College"","" No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them.

Furthermore, everyone should be allowed to vote not just citizens. The fact that not everybody are qualified citizens to vote, then the amount of votes would be vague. This process is similar to not having enough electoral votes. The votes would not be popular or in a great amount for that specific place. For example, as it mentions in source 3, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average..."" There should not be any thoughtful voters deciding on the election. It makes it unfair for those who want to vote but are not allowed.

On the other hand, Electoral College could have benifits. In this process it is easier for the electors who are voting. If there is a tie in votes, then they can pass it on to the House of Representatives in which state delegations take care of the voting. At least with this process, they have their own system set up and if any problems, they know in what way it can be fixed. Unlike voting by popular vote, it can cause some problems because not everyone is allowed to vote and there could be few votes for candidates which would have a negative outcome. However, it would be the same for the Electoral College because there would be not enough electors in regions.

In conclusion, election by popular vote for the president of the United States should be used. It could change society and it will allow us to have a better living. This could give us a chance to vote and feel part of the election. As mentioned in source 2, ""Abolish the electoral college!""    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I also agree with Bob Dole, ""Abolish the electoral college!"" It is unfair and irrational to our country.

What if those three people are going for Republicans? and the majority of their state that they represent votes for Democrats? it would not be fair to the rest of the state because they all wanted the opposite of what the Electoral College wanted, so the Electoral College basically gets to make the final decision of who they want in office.

The Electoral College that is used when electing the president is a flawed system and should be replaced by and election by the popular voted. The Electoral College does not always show what the people want and it is unfair to voters in certain states.

The Electoral College should be replaced with an election by popular vote because it is not always a fair representation of what the voters want. This means that if most of the popular votes can be for one candidate, but the other candidate wins the majority of the Electoral votes. This is shown in the article

In Defense of the Electora College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. In thsi source the author states,""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral voter will not win the popular vote. ... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but fewer electoral votes""(Posner, Line 16). This shows how what the mahjority of the people want to happen, will not always happen in this flawed system.

This system is also unfair to voters in certain states. Candidates usually campaign in what are called ""swing states"" that could vote for either candidate, but this means that many states that candidates are confident of winning in or states they are sure of losing in, will not be campaigned at all. This unfairness is shown in the article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. This article says,""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning ... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad""(Plumer, Line 13). This unfairness causes voters in some states to be uninformed about the candidates which could cause them to vote for people they wouldn't if they had seen some campaigning.

The Electoral College is a flawed system that is unfair to voters and does not always reflect what the citizens want.

Many say that the Electoral College so not be used anymore, but some will come back and argue that it should be used.

Many people dislike the Electoral College because the say it is unfair or irrational. The Electoral College is way different than popular vote. Popular votes are actually done by the people and they pick who they want for president, but the Electoral College is done by a person picking someone of their state's goverment and then leaves it to them to pick their president. Te electorial votes are unfair because it deoends on how big a state's population is. Some states only have 3

Electoral votes, but if that state used its popular votes it would

A LOT

more than just three votes to one president.

Many people on the other hand do like the Electoral College. They like the Electoral College because the stae will have voted and not leave it to the people to. In 2012 only about one-half of elgible voters did vote. The Electoral College is said to be the most effecient way of voting by some people. People like the Electoral College more than popular voting is because in popular voting you will have certain people ote for cerain people not the best candidate, but in Electoral voting the person has nothing to do with the outcame so there will be no arguing on whos fault it is.

451D81265E8E,"The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system, and that the Electoral College fosters a presidency campaign that appeals to multiple regions of the United States. This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.

Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary. According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", Source 2, argues that a term called 'disaster factor', or the possibility of immenent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished. The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in Lousiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, ""faithless"" electoral voters would vote for the other side. These are strawman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system. The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a ""winner-take-all"" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, ""..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.."", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress.

In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign. Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The ""winner-take-all"" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests..."", and so having a trans-regional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens.

Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided.

248BA02C6B96,"In my opinion, I do not think that the electoral college should be abolished, but I do agree with some of the points that Mr. Plumer claimed. Mr. Plumer stated, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" While it is somewhat unfair and outdated, the electoral college is needed in a sense of today's society. Everytime someone who is African American is murdered or killed, people always think it's a racial matter. Take a look at the incidents that were going on in Ferguson. Michael Brown, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by an officer, who was a white man. The people of Ferguson were literally rioting in the streets over a matter of a cop defending himself. So if that kind of society were to directly vote for our next president, it would be extremely biased. If another African American were to run for president of the United States, most Blacks would vote for him and say things like, ""If he doesn't win presidency, then this country is racist!"" To me, that's how American society is and that's why we should keep the electoral college.

In addition, the electoral college is needed to keep balance and fairness among the country. If there was no electoral college, and the votes came straight from the people, there would be problems regarding the states and the population of those states. For example, California would have a huge advantage at deciding who the next president is over a small state like Maryland. The electoral college is meant to keep balance among most, if not all, the states.

Another reason to keep the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, according to Mr. Posner. He states, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If there was no electoral college, the votes would heavily swing one way or the other, because of regional culture. People in the South would generally vote for someone who is white and Republican, where as the North, or states like Florida and California would vote for someone who is democratic, and since race is a exponentially large matter in today's society, people who are African American would vote for the runnning candidate who is African American or of black descent.

A vote straight from the people could work if racial perspective wasn't a huge factor like it has been since the civil rights movement. But right now, this country needs an electoral college because without one, votes would be based on race, state size, and culture.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I believe that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of theUnited States. If we are a democracy, then we are a government for the people and by the people, so then why dont we elect directly by the people. Popular vote is what the all of the eligible citezens want. Aren't we supposed to be elected by the people that we are going to represnt. This is not an oligarchy, ruled by the electoral college.

Well some people say that the people vote for the electors who are responsible for voting for the candidate they have pledged to, as it says in source 3 : In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. But, some of these electors are not faithful and go against what they are supposed to do. And, why turn down thousands of voters. If a state such as Florida for example voted for electors by popular vote, and 200,000 voted for the democrat elector, and 100,000 voted the other way, then thoses 100,000 people we be canceled out. If there was no electoral vote, and the whole voting system was by popular vote, then everybody would have a say and no one with be canceled out. That is the true way of democracy.

If we are a democracy then why not give the election to the citizens insted of the ellectors. The President is the leader of our country, so he should lead the way we want him to. And, the only way to make sure of this is by popular vote, so the people directly vote for who we need to lead at that time. The Electoral College has made many mistakes, and stired different prblems before. People also say that a tie is a very unpredictable and risky situation. If it was voted by the Electoral college there would be a higher chance of a tie then by popular vote. if you do the math 538 to1 is a higher percentage chance of a tie then 300,000,000 plus to 1. Popular vote would be a more efficient, less risky, and a moral and ethical system.

So, overall it would be better and we should change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. There are many reasons, and these are just a few. It is a more efficient, less risky, practical, ethical, and moral system that is better than the Electoral College.

As you know every four years a president is elected. In order for that to happen the candidates go through the process of an Electoral College or the people vote. An Electoral College is when the congress gets to vote to pick who the president and vice president will be. And the other way is when the people of that state get to vote.

First, some disavantages of doing an Electoral College is if the president is bad the congress will get blammed. Vandalism, riots, breaking laws. Who knows how far people will go to get their way. And there are many more mistakes that happen. As said in the article

What's wrong with the electoral college , the voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Now there are some disavantages for the people voting but not as many and not as bad. Yes people can still get angery and do bad things, but due to the privacy when we vote there is no one to speicficly blame. There are way more of us then the congress, so mistakes won't always affect things as bad.

Next, even though there are many many disavantages and mistakes about the Electoral College there are a few advantages. Like it takes less time for the congress to vote. But to be honest why rush to fail. But by letting the people vote it gives everybody a fair chance to say their oppinion and it has so much less conflict. I admit the congress does know alot but the decesion on the president is going to mostly affect us, the people.

Everybody has the right to have their own oppinion. But sometimes some make more sense then others. In my oppinion I think the people should vote. Yes, we live in a free state but there are very few things we can do to change things. The congress has power over so much and it it feels like the most people can do is say what we think, even when we know it can't change anything. We the people don't have the power to change much but by letting the people vote it can make a big differnce.

Lastly, the United States is a great place and no one wants to see it go down hill from one wrong mistake. And the solution is very simple, let the people vote. The people's oppinion are very important and need to be heard!

Unfortunately we may not always please everyones needs because that is impossible, but it is a smart decision to maintain the U.S. president election style. Electoral College is not as time consuming as a popular vote, most of the time the outcome of the electoral vote is certain.

Keeping the Electoral College in order to elect our president every 4 years is certainly the best idea. You see an electoral vote is technically a voice for the people of the state depending on the population of the state. Many states are large in size meaning that opinions, beliefs, and needs are not all the same. That's where the Electoral College comes in, they voice the votes. Majority rules most of the time, now it may not be what some people want but if it is what most want then I believe its fair.

Only the 2000 election was disputed over. Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet Bush was elected to presidency because of the Electoral College. Even though this election was disputed it has only been one out of 50 elections. If our presidents were picked directly by the people (popular vote) there would be a dispute because of needs and what the people want. Not only that but peoples favoritism would show. Even though the Electoral College vote depends upon many peoples vote towards one president it is smarter.

Last but not least elections as it is already are time consuming, can you imagine if instead of looking at those ""4"" electoral votes we had to look at each persons vote per state. Instead of knowing within a year or a couple months we'd know by the time the presidents term is up. Americans don't have the patience to wait all that time, ""Time equals money."" Electoral votes are much quicker and the certainty of the outcome of what you as a civilian want living in a certain state is very likely.

Therefore Electoral College should be kept instead of Popular vote, because it is time consuming, it is good for big states, and it is less likely of a dispute. Even though this method is not liked by all it is the smartest and most efficient.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
57142A16C1E0,"I agree that changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be a better choice than to continue Electoral College. You may ask yourself why. Well, it's not fair to have to pick a random person to do something you should be the one doing. It's like saying you pick your neighbor to clean your house. Your house is still being cleaned, but not by you, instead, a random person you don't even know. Thus, continueing Electoral College is the same because in this case, the elector you pick and don't even know is going to make choices that at the end of the day you might not even agree on and you can't do nothing about it at that point.

During Elecoral College voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. This means, there is too many names on the list that you most likely have never even heard in your life, therefore leading you to voting for the wrong candidate. Some electors aren't even faithful, instead of going for their party's candidate, they rather decide voting for whomever they please. Most likely leading to alot of conflict because the candidate is not even on their party and the voters would hate to have to follow someone else's rules, yet again, can't do nothing about it.

Voters would always love to control whom their electors vote for, but this will never happen with Electoral College. The whole point to me for the Electoral College is so that the people voting for the electors won't have any power against anything. So that the government continues to have power over the people. That can be great at some point, but sooner or later will cause confict because some people don't always agree with what the government has to say or do. Therefore, changing to election by popular vote for president of U.S would be much better than to continue Electoral College.

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong

"". States that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now right there is a perfect example of electors being ""unfair"". Electors want people to keep voting for them so that they can pick the candidates, yet, they always skip the part of showing who the candidates are. There is no why people will randomly guess how their candidates will end up being if they never even hear a few words from them.

In conclusion, I strongly believe changing to election by popular vote for president of U.S is a wiser decision than to continue Electoral College because it'll be fair to the people who are voting. People will start to get together to try and get to know the candidate, and most likely agree more to the idea than anything else. Mean while, Electoral College is a very unfair system because they have no idea who the elector is going to pick as candidate, and if they pick someone who they don't even know at the end of the day they will be stuck with a total stranger.                        ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Sources from source 2: The Indefensible Electoral college: why even the best - laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumet. Reason 1  explains that many electors could ruin the president campaign and Reason 2 states many elector go for big states to cast in more votes other than small states.

Many may not realize but when they vote they're not voting for the president, they're voting for state electors, for example ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated "" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)"". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems.

The electors want to cast in more votes from big states other than small states. Source 2 quoted "" Because of the -take- all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" The author explains that many electors don't even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states.

Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,  many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.

4F6084AE3A42,"I think that keeping electoral college would be a great idea for many reasons, we have had the electoral college for many years now and it has been great it has many good benifits to it. but many people are against it they believe there vocies aren't  being heard but it is just be revised by that people that know what is best for the country.

One of the reasons the electoral college must stay is that the will be a certainty of the outcomes, they will know exacty what will be coming out as a result instead of being uncertain for example(source 1) Obama recived 6.1 percent from the electoral vote and 51.3 percent for the poplar votes. It was an uncertain vote because the college don't know what the people would pick as a result. but many people think that it should be like that because they are voting for a slate of elector and not for president.(sourse 2)

Another good reason why the elctoral college is a good idea is that it balances the state votes. The states that are larger such as Texas and california have a much larger population so the votes would be larger but the electoral college balances out and the smaller states such as new jersey and main have a small population so the votes wold be smaller. The larger states get more attention from the presidential candidates than the smaller states, so the electoral college balences it out.(sourse 3)

Also the electoral college avoids run-off elections. The electoral college give more for a cleary response, for example,(sourse 3) nixon in 1968 and clinton both had 43 percent plurlity of popular votes but the electoral votes gave them a more accurate result of 301 nixon and 370 cliton. the electoral college gave a more accurate result of who sould of win the election.

That's why I think that the electoral college is better it gives certainty of outcome, balances out the big states, and avoids run-off elections. While popular vote does give us the same certainty.                                ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College has so much room for error. When you vote, you dont vote for a president, instead you're voting for a slate of electors. Electors can defy the people, it isnt rational, and it just simply isnt fair to voters.

When you go in to vote, you really arent voting for a president. Instead you are voting for a slate of electors who will then go a vote for the president. A state can choose their electors differently. Some are party centeral and some are not.

The states legislatures are held accountible for the electors that are picked. Those electors can defy the people and choose whomever they please. ""Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F.

Many people want to have a popular vote so that they are counted and heard.

237E08ECC729,"How does the Electoral College affect the selection of the presidency and is it a positive force? Many may answer ""No."" or ""I don't know."" to these questions, only doing such because that's what they've been or what they've heard others say. While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its certainty, its transregionality, and it lets ""the most thoughtful voters"" (Posner Source 3) decide the election.

Swings states let candidates to campaign where it really matters. Being a voter in a swing state means you have to have extra close attention to the campaigns and the candidates, leaving you to be more thoughtful than voters in states that aren't swing states. And in turn voters in these states will definitely receive ""the most information and attention from the candidates"" (Posner Source 2). Voters from these states at the end of the campaigns will no doubt be the most informed voters in the nation, giving them the right to decide the fate of the election for the future.

A successful president must be voted for across the regions of the United States to fufill the wants and needs of its diverse people. While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, ""residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests.

The use of the Electoral College allows for a more certain winner over popular vote, therefore avoiding election crisis. Although there was one ""fiasco"" in 2000, as Bradford Plumer calls it in Source 2, the chance of this happening is very small since ""even a very slight pulrality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (Posner Source 3) For example, in 2012, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote while he recieved only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.(Posner Source 3). A 1.3 percent from a tie is much, much more close than the 11.7 percent that that the Electoral College gives us.

While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.                    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

My 3 reasons what is a(n) Electoral College is : Why do we need a Electoral College, Whats wrong with it, and 5 reasons why we choose a president. We have to find out whats going on with this Electoral College. If we don't something might happen. We will find the truth about the Electoral College.

Whats wrong with Electoral College?

Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president ,

according to paragraph 10 . Again they said if you live intexas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. All the votes that people vote for really aren't voting, there just voting for the slate electors. The electors choose which one they will vote for, but is that any fair, for the people, they make a choice to vote, there not being forced to vote by command. People like to vote because they want a new leader or, for instance, somebody like President Barack Obama. He is going into his 6 year as president.

Why do we need a Electoral College?

The Electoral College consists of 539 electors, according to paragraph 3.

A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the lection of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

What are the reasons why we choose a president?

The reasons why we choose a president is because of the swing states, and the big states. Swing states is a winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in [2012's] election to focus their campaign efforts on tht toss-up states. Next is the Big States, the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virture of the mal-apportionmentof the senate. The Big States are like : Texas, Californina, and Florida. But this doesn't annoy me because people still have a chance to vote whether or not, the votes don't to the congress.

In Conclusion, Electoral College is a well-known thing when to choose a president or vice president or even governer. Elecotral College is important, you can say that because maybe you agree to it but i still don't because the votes aren't really going to the votes to the congress, the votes really go to the slate of governers or the senate but the the senate or congress are really the real people that can choose the president or vice president.

3A0B15335CAE,"Dear Florida Sentator,

It is in the interest of your state and your nation that you insist the keeping of the Electoral College system of voting. This is overwhelmingly clear because it allows the presidental canidates to focus on the country as a whole in their campaign trail instead of relying on a single region to win the presidency for them, it has been present in this nation  since out founding fathers, and the system also shows a clear winner in the end of the election.

In order for the presidental canidate to have a reasonable chance at winning the presidency, he or she has to appeal to the country as a whole instead of just focusing on a particular region. This is all due to the Electoral College. A canidate who is practically assured to win in a region, such as the Northeast, would not campaign as much in those states. The article

In Defense of the Electoral College highlights that if that canidate were to becaome president of the United States, ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised...that their votes do not count...that he really isn't their president."" Just think about that. Imagine having a president who got elected just because he won over the South. It would be as if he or she had only that region's interests at heart and did not care for the rest of the nation. The Presidnet is suppose to be the leader for the whole nation, not just a section of it. If this were to happen,the nation would be fractured, all because we got rid of the Electoral College. Some might argue that that probabably would never happen, and it might not, but we always have to keep in mind the worse scenarios to ensure the best decisions for the United States.

The Electoral College is arguably an old method of voting. It was established by our founding fathers and has been quite realiable over the couple hundred years it has been in service. Admittably, there have been a few blips in the system, but what system doesnt have kinks that need to be rolled out once and a while? It was intended to be ""...a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" as explained in

What is the Electoral College?

Why should this system be outed because of a fleeting feeling of anachronism? The intention of this system is meant to give equal votes to both the people and Congress.

The Electoral College system of voting has been under scrutiny lately. It has been a controversial issue. The system has had its share fo faults, but no more than a new system of voting would have. The Electoral College has served its country well and has given voices to the small states, given canidates a broader spectrum on their campaign trail, has been around for over 200 years, and shows a clear winner when all the votes are counted.

""given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.""if the vote is more popular it is not right to change it because the electoral college thinks differently.

We should keep the Electoral College but should change some of the rules. We should have a Congress that knows best about what we should do to make our country better. They should be wise with age and should know better than to elect someone who is no good for this country. The votes should be runned by the people and they should have a say if the person running to be President or Vice President should run at all. The people have the majority vote, so they should be able to have a say. It does take longer but it is what's right.

We don't need to get rid of the Congress but we need to be better about who we put in the office to run our beautiful country. They need to come and show us who they really are. Visit a town and get them your vote. The Electoral College has done some good things in the past but we should change it. The Congress needs to be made up of people who know what is right and which canadite to choose as our President.

If you are going to be in Congress and are voting for a specific party, then you need to stay in that party. The canadite is going to feel like you betrayed them after everything they have done for you. Just because your rich doesn't make it okay to betray what's right for this country. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our  despised method of choosing the President, Richard A.

B396296EF19F,"Dear senator,

I wanted to write you this letter to say that we should keep the electoral college. Because they tally the votes fair to elect the goverment and president that the people of this powerful country have elected to be their leader. The electoral college was one of the rules that our founding fathers made for our country which has kept our country stong in the past so why would we want to take away that cause that would be like erasing our countrys past and our fathers rule. The electoral college consists of 538 electors for the electoral college so if we take away this process cause its not a place then we are putting 538 people out of a job.

First things First, we should keep the electoral college cause it is a great process that lets our people choose a leader of this brave and powerful country fairly by having the electors read the votes and tally them up and pick the leader the most people voted for but sometimes its not the most cause if bigger states with more powerful people vote for a diffrent president and the one president has the most votes but if the other one has the more votes from bigger states and cities like california then he gets the popular vote. The electoral college has never technically failed us it has gotten close in the John F. Kennedy election when state legislators were technically responsible for picking electors and that the electors could defy the will of the people so say like if John F. Kennedy got the popular vote then it could possibly not go to him cause the electors could get replaced with new ones that could oppose him. The mistakes were never to the point that it messed up our country just little mistakes that got fixed by a direct election which we have now a day so that these little mistakes cant mess our whole voting system up. We should keep the electoral college because it is proven that people have out voted electors in the Gore vs Bush election cause Bush got the electoral votes but Gore got the popular vote by the people.

Second of All, we should keep the electoral college because it was one of our founding fathers rules and processes and they were the people who founded and discovered this brave, powerful, and beutifal country so if we throw that away then we are betraying our fathers and our anceistors. Another thing is electoral college has of america and they aint running for president and they are aloud to vote which is fair cause it's everyones president not just only the people not appart of the constitution. The great rule that our constitution made for the electoral college was the mal-apportionment which means even if the large states has a bigger population they still could lose by virtue so if we dont have an electoral college that will not be possible then we would just get out voted by heavier states and electors. The electoral college is a great process for fair voting for our goverment and president and if we keep that running then we keep our country running as a healthy country.

To Wrap it up, I think we should keep our electoral college for many of reasons. one because its the fairest most strongest process of voting. two because it lets everybody vote including the electors. and last but not least it keeps our founding fathers rule going and keeps us loyal to our brave and powerful countrys leader.

There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College,  the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state.

To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""  Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote.

Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370).

It would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman. Imagine all the wonderful things you can learn about congress and you can have your own personal experience. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requried to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in the Congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Taxas, fpr instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democatic electors pludges to Mr. Kerry.

It would look good on your reputation. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. I know your would wat that because that would be great, and really helpful. The presidential election is held every four yoears on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential  election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official recors of the presidential election.

To me, it is only fair that we rid of the Electoral College and change it to an election by popular vote.

When I am old enough to vote, I would like to see that my vote counted for the President and not a group of electors. One main problem with the Electoral College is the fact that the trust can be betrayed. What about what happened in Hawaii in 1960? When Vice President Richard Nixon luckily precided over the senate, validating only his oppenent's electors, but made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent."" What if it happens again? You are voting for someone that could be anyone not holding a public office.

If you really think about it, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Think of it like this, you're in a class of 30 and you get to vote on who is your new class president. You all vote but the teacher only counts 10 of the kids' votes that have a higher ranking. It is not fair to the other 20 students because they all voted too, but their votes didn't really count.

The Electoral College can be thought of as unfair, outdated, and irrational. It would be so much easier if we just counted the votes from the citizens of the United States in a majority rules fashion. This way, everyones' vote counts and we wouldn't have to worry relying on someone to make the vote for us.

I am writing to you State Senator to show you how we, the United States of America, really feel. Isn't it true in Amendment 1, that we as the people have a freedom of speech? Well I think my speech should be heard and I want you to listen.

3D6EFCCB4DFB,"Florida Senator-

I had not known much about the electoral college until now, and I am appauled that this election process has been used ever since the establishment of the Constitution-decades ago.  The electoral college is unfair, raises dispute, does not provide an accurate representation of the country's vote as a whole, and the process is simply not logical.  I feel like we, as a country, could avoid a great deal of dispute that arises, regarding the electoral college voting system, if it were changed to election by popular vote.

First of all, when the electoral college voting system is used, while people may think they are voting for a presidential canidate, they are not.  Voters are actually choosing a group of electors that then elect a president.  Shouldn't something that has a great impact on our country, such as electing the president of the United States, be chosen by the people living in the country under the president's decisions?  Anyone would agree that the people should have the power to contribute to these decisions, yet somehow the electors are taking this huge responsibility into their own hands.

Another issue with the electoral college is that it gives canidates different motives for their campaign.  I believe that in an electoral campaign, canidates should be advertising their views equally to all parts of the country, if all parts of the country get to have a say in their voting.  However, most of the time, entire countries are skipped over by canidates, as if they don't matter, so that the canidates can talk to states that they find more important to get a vote from.  In the election of 2000, a seventeen whole states didn't see the canidates at all, and some of the larger states didn't see a single campaign ad.  If the presidents know that they are practically guaranteed the electoral votes by a state, why would they waste their time trying to persuade a state that is already persuaded?  It makes sense for the canidates to see ""swing states""-the states that are more divided, and whose electoral votes are not guaranteed one way or another.  I don't blame the canidates for their methods, but the electoral college itself for bringing about these techniques for campaigning.

The last problem with the electoral college that I would like to address is how the electoral college discourages people from certain states from voting.  For example, a Rebulican in California or a Democrat in Texas are obviously aware that their vote isn't going to count towards the majority of the state's votes, or to which canidate the state's electoral votes will be going to.  People are definitely more likely to vote if they know that their vote will be heard in some way.  The ""winner takes all"" method is eliminating any representation of the opposing party's vote and discourages the minority of the state from voting.  Everyone says that being a good citizen requires being aware and involved with government decisions, and voting whenever possible, yet in the 2012 election, one-half of Americans that were eligible to vote, did not.  I'm sure that a good portion of non-voters were influenced by the unfair ways of the electoral college.

As you can see, the electoral college brings about many issues-issues that could be easily avoided if the electoral college was changed to the much simpler and straight forward popular voting system.  Our country would be accurately represented, people would feel as if their vote actually makes a difference, presidential campaign would be consistent for all states, and we would actually be able to vote for the specific person we are trying to vote for in the first place.  With all of these reasons been said, I think it is pretty clear that the electoral college should be abolished, and that government should change to election of the president of the United States simply by popular vote.            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I am writting this letter on behaf of my feelings on changing the election by popular vote.

The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)

""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state.

Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational! Some of the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality

The Electoral college can be greatly described as a pedigree. The Electoral College being around for so long as the time of our founding fathers- quite a long time, now having doubts? ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anaschornism,"". Can't say that anyone shouldn't be surprised just like anything in this life everything comes to an end at some point. Agreed that it is unfair something like the Electoral College to be around especially in this era, it craves more rights than it feels it's been restricted from. Yes, it has a history that truly lights the room of American development, but already many things from the government have changed, Would it really hurt to change the Electoral College?

America has always been about the people? With the Electoral College it's the people's choice with a twist. ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors,"" it would be much simpler if the candidate you voted for would just be elected, and also democratic to choose that way...totally giving your vote to a group of people. Although their hasn't been numerous situations in which the Electoral College vote will dosen't win the national popular vote...It still happened and also a possibility that it can happen again! Why have two different types of votes when you can easily have one vote? ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population)"" the vote is America broken in one whole breaking up the population in each state, which is equivalent to breaking us up in 13 colonies. We should be considered one!

""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November."" Example that everything is in order and exact, and has not changed just like how over the years we have found that some things that our Founding Fathers did were ""wrong"" why not put doubt in the electoral vote? Yes, also true the electoral vote keeps other parties who are not sufficient enough to run the country, but their aren't many voters usually not voting for either a republican or democrat, proof that the electoral vote simply is an anachronism. A winner-take-all basis dosen't seem like that big of a deal after all only one person has to be president, but the electoral vote dosen't affect that...at all. Any rebuddle going against a non-electoral voting society dosen't seem to make a valid reason.

I read all these articles about some states having to vote for the president's electors. They say basically when your voting for a president, your voting for his/hers electors. My opinion is there should be no need for electors. It should be easy and not too complicated. A presdient, a vice president, and a secatary. No electors or nothing. I think a president can do alot of his own work and think of ideas alone. If he need help than instead of us wasting our time with voting for people to give the presdient ideas and help him out. Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America. Yes, I think the candidate with the most votes should win. But, If they say that their going to do something for our country than they need to keep their word. Make it a better place not for himslef but for everyone. For instance, Barack Obama. What's the need for this unessarcy work that he has done. America is loosing their mind and doesnt know what's going on. Why is he doing this? The president is to make smart decent relevant choices. And if he listen to the voices of Americans than he would have lots of ideas lots! Instead he listens to who? His electors. People complain saying to themselfs, Where does he come up with these ideas? Well if you payed close attention to the presidents background and know what he really wants to do than you would know why. Honestly to me I dont think the Electoral College should keep going its just a bunch of mess that just doesnt make sence. Elelctors dont matter to most American's. Take the electors and the Electoral College away we dont want something we dont need. All we need is a President, a Vice Presdient, and a Secatary.

9ED4B21C6CC4,"Florida Senators,

The Electoral College is an unfair process. With multiple presidents winning the popular vote and losing their presidency, it is nondemocratic. Myself, along with many other people across the state, believe that elections should be based on popular vote rather than the decisions of 538 electors. Although the Electoral College has its advantages, I believe that a majority vote by the people of the United States would be more accurate as well as fair.

The Electoral College is a winner-takes-all system, meaning that candidates spend lots of time campaigning in the ""swing"" states rather than others. In 2000, seventeen states didn't even get to see the candidates. This means that almost 34% of voters didn't get a real feel for who they will be casting their votes for. Even though presidents should focus their time on big states with larger populations, it is unfair to the smaller states who don't get any visits from their candidates.

With the Electoral College system, voters vote for a slate of electors, rather than the presidents themselves. This means that when you cast your vote for Barack Obama ,for example, you are not voting for him. you are actually voting for a certain number of electors who contribute to the candidate's electoral votes. Electors can be anyone not in public office and they are usually chosen by the state. This is a corrupt system because the electors could be anyone, and change their ideas to not reflect the views of the people. In 1960, Louisiana legislature segregationists almost replaced all of the Democratic electors electors with new Kennedy-opposing electors. The errors and problems in this system could be much greater, and goverment officials must be monitoring it at all times.

In the event of an Electoral College tie, the president election decision would be given to the House of Representatives, and the vice-president decision to the Senate. This doesn't seem too terribly bad, but one representative from Wyoming would be representing 500,000 voters, and would have as much say as the 55 representatives representing 35 million people inhabiting California. This is not fair because of the widespread views of people in each state. There cannot be one candidate that the whole state agrees on, as people's ideas differ across the states.

There are many reasons to keep, as well as dispose of the Electoral College. The negatives outweigh the positives and a popular vote would be more democratic. We are supposed to be a democracy, and democracies thrive on the views of the people instead of electors.

DC4C58A0643D,"Forida senator, I argue to remove the Electoral College and replace it by changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Voting is not fair to the people because they can't vote for the President, only for the state electors, and even if the candidate that won the most popular votes, may not be elected. Also, the winner-takes-all system is not fair to voters because the candidates don't spend time in states they cannot win in or small states and mostly in swing states.

""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The passage stated in paragraph 10. Voting has changed over many years, but I think that people should be able to vote for the President and have that candidate win the election if they get the magority of popular votes. If the people want to have that candidate as the President, so be it. Although the Electoral College may help by not having a tied election and have a ""Certainty of Outcome"", but it should be what the people want and vote for. In my opinion, it would be better to not feel like you're putting in a vote that isn't what you wanted. The vote from the people go to state electors for them to choose and that is not truely fair to the people.

The candidates should spend time in all states to try to get their vote instead of the winner-takes-all system; therefore, it should be removed. There are people in the state that have voted for that candidate but they don't go to the state because they only focus on the swing states. I understand that they do go there to try to win the election and become president, but they should at least spend some amount of time in other states. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" As stated in the passage in paragraph 13.

If we keep the Electoral College, then even if you do earn the most individual votes, you might not be elected president. If you have earned the most individual votes then you should be elected president because you have the majority's vote. If we keep the electoral College then if you are elected president but do not recieve the majority of the individual votes, the president elected by the Electoral College will not be a popular president to the people who voted against them.

Source 2 says, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" So with the Electoral College, the electors that are chosen might not elect those who they said they would. But with election by popular vote, the person elected will always be who the majority of the country wants as president.

If someone who is running get more states to vote for them, it does not mean that they will be elected because they have to get more votes overall from the electors.

1A4DFD122114,"Dear Senator of Florida,

I am a 15 year old concerned citizen and I would like to address a serious problem. Our country's process of electing our president, the Electoral College. I beleive there are certain aspects of this process which are both good, and bad, but still need to be revised. To fix this unfair system of election, we just need to change a few details of it, in particular, the states' ""winner-take-all"" system.

Of course there are people who agree with this method of voting, but i am not one of them, and neither is Bradford Plumer. In Bradford's excerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"", He explains to us the injustice of the electors that we vote for. Most of the time electors stay with their party's candidate, but sometimes they can be persuaded to switch sides. How would you like it if you and the majority of your state voted for a certain president through your states electors, and they went and stabbed you in the back(figuratively) and voted for the other president. You have just been cheated out of your vote! That doesnt sound very democratic to me.

People do actually believe in this system of voting though, hard to believe, I know, but Richard A. Posner's ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" gives us a pretty good reason of why they should. Richard explains to us the method of how a larger state with a large population, which would have a larger popular vote, has more weight than a smaller state with a smaller population and a smaller popular vote. He also tells us how there will always be an outcome, no matter what. Like how Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote and 51.3% of the popular vote. Cutting it a bit close there? Enough of that percentage of popular votes lost during the ""winner-take-all' method could change the election of the president.

So dont you see? ""Winner-take-all"" method just gained someone more votes than they deserved! Essentially robbing the other candidate of his votes! Once again Bradford Plumer hit the nail on the head with his description of the ""winner-take-all"" method. He understands the system and we are lucky enough he explains it to us in such easy terms. Instead of a candidate making his rounds to each of the states and raising his popularity, he ignores certain states that he knows he will get all of the votes for because he already owns a majority, 50%. It could be as little as 51% for him to gain all the votes of that state, and depending on the population of that state, lost more voters for the other candidate than an entire 's sum could give him. So candidates spend time in only a select few states trying to win the vote. Wouldn't this make you feel left out? Unimportant? Nothing but just a blip in the course of your country's history? I wouldnt want that feeling.

All ready a few states such as Maine and  Nebraska have realized the stupidity of this system and have decided to change their voting method. This is why I write to you as our senator to help our state correct this process so we can fairly and justly choose our president, but what do I know, Im only 15.

7247BBE354B9,"Many people question why we use the Electoral College instead of the popular vote.  They think it's outdated irrational but we have been using this system for 100 of years.  The Electoral College is a fair way to elect the president.

Certainly, the Electoral College has some flukes.  Using the Electoral College system ""your not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors,"" asserted Bradford Plumer, author of The Indefensible Elecotral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of system are wrong.  Instead of voting directly towards the future president; the citizens are voting for the states electors for that party.  What if it's a tie? ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,"" Plumer claimed.  If it's a tie it is no longer up to the people, but it moves on to the House of Representatives and they decide.  In the contrary, both parties select a slate of electors in trust to vote for the nominee and the trust is rarely betrayed.  Also, there hasn't been many times of when the vote comes down to a tie.  Therefore, the Electoral College should not be changed.

Above all, the Electoral College is fair and doesn't spark up as many disputes as popular vote.  Richard A. Posner, author of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President remarks, ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000- but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.""  It is less likely because the winner-take-all technique even the smallest range of votes turns into a landslide.  ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, but it is highly unlikely.""  Even though the Electoral vote consists of 538 votes there is a possibility of a tie.  The overall vote for each party would both have to equal 269 votes.  Proof shows the Electoral College is fair.

Furthermore, the Electoral College doesn't have a majority vote.  Plumer claims, ""the Electoral College avoids the porblem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.""  This exemplifies why the Electoral College has more fairness then the popular vote.  If there isn't a majority vote the people are voting on what they truly believe.  ""Voters  in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who thinkg that a single ovte may decide an election,""  Plumer asserts.  People voting don't just vote for the fun of it.  They vote because they want a president who can make their lives better.

In final consideration, the election of the president should be casted by the Electoral College.  It is clear that the Electoral College is the better choice because we have used it ever since it was created.  Why change it now?         ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I dont truely have a major problem dealing with the electoral college, its just that i believe that changing it to a popular vote of the president would be easier. Its kind of unnecessary to have as many elctions for all these different levels. It all takes far too long to decide which candidate would better suit this country. I understand it all has to be fair but its better having the popular vote.

When the past leaders of this country were trying to abolish the electoral college, i dont think they were wrong for that. If you believe something isnt right, and your not the only one who believes the same as you, than there must be something wrong. It isnt fair if you win the popular vote and end up losing because of the electoral college. If you really think about it, the electoral college really has the say so of the entire election. So why involve the citizens of this country if what they say dont mean anything at all.

Another important thing is that, the electors that are elected by the state could always defy the will of the people(paragraph 11). For example: the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy. This is absolutely outrageous that someone could lose the opportunity to be president all because of the electors not approving. Its like when your says you can do something but the principle says no.

The only time an electoral college is necessary is if the presidential race is at a tie with the number of votes and its all on the electoral college. The electoral college shouldnt have to be involved if the race isnt a tie and is going smooth. Its like sticking your nose in someones business, or getting involved in something that doesnt concern you. The electoral college is just a big insigator.

So in conclusion, there is no need for the electoral college. It causes too much controversy and shouldnt be brought into play unless a tie has occured. The presidential race should run smoothly on popular vote.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

89039D21E960,"Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out. I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for many reasons. One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite.

To start this off, if our president was decided by a popular vote, our president might not be the best thing for our country. As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign effors on the toss-up states."" As you know, toss-up state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group (Democratic or Republic). Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the canidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place.

Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might simply win because he (or she) is a regional favorite. As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winner-take-all"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president.

Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the canidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.

In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.            ",6,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1ED477F0A412,"Electoral college votes are used to elect the new president, It consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 must be won by a canidate to be elected. The ammount of electors is the number of memberis in its congressional delegation; One for each member in the house of repersenatives, Plus 2 for the senators. There is also a pouplar vote which is used to see what canidate is the more pouplar one, But this is not used to select the winner. I think the pouplar vote should be used because if the pouplar vote for one canidate but electoral vote is higher for the other the one with the pouplar vote is clearly the one people want more.

I think that the way someone is elected as president should be changed from who has the most electoral votes to who has the highest pouplar vote. For example say you were and 16 other people were sitting at 8 different tables, 2 people are at all the tables, Your voting on which is better mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes, you all have different numbers, and say yours is the highest, which ever you voted for would would basically win unless no one voted for it, Which isnt fair in a real election. In a election the candiates focus more more on the stated with more votes such a california or florida, And if they get the bigger states vote they've pretty much won.

All in all the electoral college isnt fair, the pouplar vote is how we should elect our president, so lets change this and see what happens, Maybe it wont work out that well, we'll just have to try and see.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

For example , In the article "" Does the Electoral College Work?"" source 1 ,pharagrapgh 15 , it states that ""Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense,""when the people vote , their voting for a slate of electors.

A dispute over the outcome of Electoral College Vote is possible- it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. in pharagrapgh 18, it states that the reason is that the winning candidates share of the Electoral Collge is invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.

what is the callage electoral ?

the electoral collage is a compromise between electing a president by voteing in congress and election of the president by how many popalar vote for qualified as to be a president.

teh electoral has many process such as meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.

oto be elected for president u need to have a majority of 270 electorals votes cause the electoral callage consists of 538 electors under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbai is allocated 3 electors and trated like a statte for purposes of the electoral collage.

pretty much each candidate running for president in any state has his or her own group of electors.

any president thats running for election is held every fore years on the tuseday after the first monday in novermber.

most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winninfg presidential candidate.

elctoral collage they're not alone according to a gullup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage won the popular.

the problem with electrola collage is that under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.

thje singel best argument against the electoral collage is whtat we might call the disaster factor. we consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electtors.

perhaps most worrying thing is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. and the election would br thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, the electoral collage is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in eavh state, bcandiadates dont spend time in state they know they have no chance of winninf-g, focusinfg only on the races in the swing states.

collage method of selcting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a sinle vote may decide a n election.

in my conculesion we should change the election by who has most popular votes for the president of the untied states, because it make more scence the election always go by votes and who ever have the most votes is elected for the president of the untied state. the eletoral collage system wasnt that good to many things going on i mean like it was kinad of good but not better then election on popaler votes.

D6D0E7AD9AC0,"Mr. Senator, the United States should keep the Electoral College process. This process makes sure that there will be a winner. It also makes sure that a candidate doesn't have a regional appeal.

The Electoral College process is certain that there will be a winner. There are 538 electors.

A tie is possible just because 538 is an even number; most likely it will never happen. The big states get more electoral votes than the small states therefore if a presidential candidate gets the attention of most big states he has a higher chance of being elected. This process avoids run-off elections. There will be a certain winner.

The candidates have no regional appeal using this process. If a candidate has a regional appeal they are not likely to win. No region (South, North, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For example Romney was in the South and the South has no incentive to campaign, so he gets no electoral votes.

Despite the Electoral College having some problems, if we get a new process it will possibly have more problems and will be more difficult to control.                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

DAD11E157730,"Election after election, candidates are winning the popular vote but are losing the election. The U.S. is making a terrible decision on keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors, but only need a vote of 270 electoral votes to elect a president. It would probably be best to elect a president with a popular vote to make the election fair.

When voters are voting for a president they are really voting for a slate of electors. The problem with the Electoral College is that they are not giving the U.S. citizens a chance to vote for who they want as president. In 2000, with the Gallup poll, Al Gore had won the popular vote, but had lost the election  do to having over 60 percent of voters prefering a direct election. It is not fair to people that if the president they like is winning that the Electoral College can change the election by making a mistake on choosing the other candidate or take the majority vote and elect that president. In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states did not see one candidate at all. The Electoral College has been named ""unfair, outdated, and irrational"". As for Bob Dole (lost election do to the Elector College), he was correct for hiw words ""Abolish the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is a anachronism(a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the declaring the candidtate who recieves the most popular votes the winner). Even though it is true that the Electoral College elects the president, and not the people, the citezens would still want a word it electing the president. The parties selected are trusted to vote but they can make a mistake and nobody will know. In the Gore vs Bush in 1888, Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but Bush had a few more Electoral vote that Gore which made Bush win the election. Also in the Obama vs. Romney election in 2012, Obama got 61.7% of the Electoral College cpmparing it to the 51.3% of popular votes between him and Romney. Which Obama put the USA in to deep dept. By which almost all states were with the votes on a winner-takes-all basis.

The winner-take-all method is used when to focus the campaign on toss-up state. The voters in toss-up states pay more close attention to the election. In Florida in 2012 election, Obama had won the state with a 29 electoral vote. Just like in Wyoming with only 3 votes. About 1/2 of the eligle American population did vote in 2012. They are the people that wanted to express the political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. People can argue that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canditate who has no hope of carrying their state which is unfair.

To add it off, the Electoral college can be quite unfair to an election. They are still going to make bad decisions on which person to elect. So I would want to change the Electoral College to a popular vote takes all.                  ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

It is the peoples right to vote on who represents our country, but why vote if you cannot choose the the direct candidate you want? I demand the electoral college to be abolished, it is a violation of the peoples right to vote for who they want. It is enough nonsesne of voting for someone to vote for you. Popular vote is the fairest way to vote, in lines 24 though 31 of the text, it exclaims that state committee's and candidates pick the electors. So candidates choose the electors that the people vote for? How do we know the candidates or committee's aren't sabataushing their power and picking the people they opinionly want, as opposed to whomever? We don't!

With the electoral college exsisting we are giving our power to other poeple that can vote for us. We are handing them free votes, so they can vote for who'm they'd like. That is not fair! They say that the most powerful person in the world is the people, but with the electoral college it has partially been robbed. In lines 26 through 27 of the text that supports the electoral college it states that ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" That sentence proves to you that the people are incontrol of voting for their president.

Yes people may say that without the electoral college favoritism may appear in certain states and places. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that! There may be more voters for one candidate in a certain place, but as long as the people voted for whom they want there is no injustice.

In lines 17 through 18 of the text that supports the electoral college it states "" that trust is rarely betrayed."" RARELY? Meaning wrongful doing has happened between the lines of the electoral college, and are likely to happen again...Do not be blind to the electoral college's purpose.

339048408CDE,"No I think that the Electoral College does not work, and it has no meaning. One reason is each running canidate for president has its own has his or her own group of electors. The electors are usually picked by the canidate's political party. Which is good that they have there own because then the votes would just be a landslide on the outcome of it. Then the citizens votes come in and thats when the votes start to seperate in total, because theres more citizens voting for the other runner than there are electors of those running presidents and vice presidents. Now every state has there own amount of electoral votes.

Now there are some bad things about the electoral colleges, for instance under this system you vote for the electors, who in turn vote for the president. And for instance you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for someone, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors that pledged to that person, then he would get all those electoral votes for the state of Texas. And voters can't always control who there electors vote for but they can sometimes, if they know who there electors are voting for. And they also sometimes get confused about the electors and sometimes vote for the wrong canidate.

So pretty much at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Canidates dont spend time in states thet know they dont have no chance of winning. And it doesnt really give them a chance to vote for who they want to vote for the electors do that part.

The most worried outcome of the votes is a tie in the electoral vote part. If that happens the election would be decided by the House Of Representatives, where they will vote on the president. And the senate would choose the vice-president. Because each state gives out only one vote. But the House's selection will most likely not reflect on the peoples choice.

Well thats what i think of the electoral college, its unfair, and outdated. I think we should get rid of this system because its reallly bad towards voters, and it  would make voting have more freedom other than leaving your voting up to the electors,  instead of yourself. And the winner-take-all system is dumb also because you have really no control over who wins if that system is available.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Have you ever thought on keeping the Electoral Vote or change it by popular vote for the president of the United States? I think you have.

On my opinion the Electoral Vote should be changed in order for people to vote for the president they want.

To begin with, the Electoral vote has a job to do. For example,if someone wants to run for president and the electoral vote has no voice in the selection there is a probability that the person doesn't get a change to talk to the people. As stated on

""..... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.""

I was writting to inform you about a topic that has been talked about for the past year, the Electoral Collage. This process has its pros and cons, but i'm more in the con side; you see the reason why the Electoral College needs to be abolished is because people dont really get to choose who their president is, the people who choose the president are the people in the Electoral College. How the Electoral College works is the state has electors and those electors have to be won by the president for the president to have how many electoral votes he gets from that state depending on how many electors that state has. The trick here is that sometimes the electors can deny the will of the people since the election is based on electoral votes not on popular votes, don't get me wrong people's votes do influence electors in deciding which president won their votes. Overall the electoral college is unfair to everyone because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states that they have no chance winning over so they got to the ""swing"" states since they have more chance of winning them over depending on their campaing. I don't think we should be trusting people to vote for us because as we have seen some electors vote for the candidate they want to win and not the candidate their state wants to win.

As a student learning more and more about the world we live in I understand that there has been problems deciding weather or not congress should continue to use the electoral college the elect our nationals new or future presidents.

But some people probably don't even know how to use it which is why the problem was arroused.

Taking aways the electoral college is like playing a game that have no obsticles nor opponents to challege you. Nothing in life is fare or cheep and by only using popular votes is to cheat the candidates of the true experience of running for what they want. If you or me were to run for president I'm sure we would want to have the oppertunity to use the electoral college to our advantage.

I believe the electoral chollege should continue to be used and nothing hsould change about how our stong nation selects our leaders because with change comes new obsticals and with those leeps and jumps comes errors. To change the way something has been done for such a long time would be like asking to distroy something and rebiuld it all the way back from the begining.

I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the President of the United States instead of keeping the electoral college. The reasons I think that we should have it changed to the popular vote is because I think the people should be able to choose who should be our next president instead of having the electoral college also voting for the president of the United States.

Its not only me senator, but also these important men of our country all agree with me that we need to abolish the electoral college! These men are Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerse.''The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.'' I just find all of this unfair because its not just the United states giving there opinion on who should be there next leader but some other men who have favortism for the opponets also vote too! One example of how i think the electoral college voters are unfair is back in the election of President Obama and Mr. Romney the electoral voters had 29 electoral votes for Obama and Romney only had 3. So, that election could have been more fair if we didnt have so much favortism for one person to another. When we could have had a fair vote from the people and had the opinions on who should be there next President.

Now, in the defese of the electoral college it does help situations in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast which can be very helpful when examples happen like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 when they both had only 43 percent of the popular votes and the electoral college helped not make those elections as complicated. But, they still had a say so on who should be president and who shouldnt be president. I think that question should be answered by our own people!

Thank you so much State Senator for reading my opinion on the electoral college versus the popular vote for the President of the United States.

Source3 of the article 'In defense of the Electoral college"" states that ""The Electoral college is wildely regarded as an ""anachronism"",a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

The soncond reason is that electoral votes might chose the wrong person to run in office. source3 part five of the article ""Indefense of the electoral college"" states that,""it can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the presidedent may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""

The last reason why is because theElectoral votes are not fair. Source3 part 2 states that ""no region...has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" also source3 states that ""Electoral college method is not demovratic in a modern sense ...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. And source 2 states that ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

In conclusion the electoral vote is un fair in many many ways. not only it chaets for others it does not let the people chose who to be president. POPULARITY votes are better than Electoral in many ways. and its modern.                                                                                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
0114B2C51347,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College is very outdated and confusing. Most American voters believe their votes elect the president even though they really don't. In truth, American voters are electing electors that instead go to the District of Columbia and vote the new president instead. As infuriating as this sounds, seeing as most Americans want a direct vote so a president is elected by popular vote, it's not entirely bad, but it isn't the best election system. The Electoral college is a system that should stay.

Most Americans that are angered and upset when they realize their vote doesn't have as much say as they though are usually the ones who fight to abolish the Electoral College. While this is true, it is also accurate, most people don't even know that they aren't even voting for the president, and their vote is only electing their state's electors. As upsetting as that is, it's mostly just like choosing a new senator or representative to represent the state. This is the same idea, our state votes for a number of people to vote for us. If we win the democratic side, democrats will vote for the democrat (they rarely betray us) candidate.

While the winner-takes-all system is unfair to those who do not agree with the side the state chose overall, it provides a clear system to clearly elect a new president. Candidates always try to persuade states, oftening visiting them to sway them to vote for electors that will go to elect them instead. Looking on the results, it's safe to say the Electoral College, as upsetting as it can be,  is a voting system that should stay until we can find a better one. Abolishing the system might make it more of a direct vote, but the Electoral College is organized.

Sincerely,

A student.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
492936A290D5,"The  Electoral College is a process which occurs in the United States to help determine the president for the next four years of the entire nation. It is a very controversial topic and a plethora of people want to disregard the Electoral College. People want to vote for their president, but ultimately they are voting for the electors of the state who represent the president in the end. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It makes the voters feel like they have less power when they are voting and when people of a nation feel that way, they lose interest and lose the desire to vote for their country because they feel like their vote will not count or have and affect.

At the end of paragraph 10, two questions are asked, ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" and ""Do voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?"". The answers were;not always and sometimes. If a system or process confuses people enough where they vote for the wrong candidate they desired, then that system needs to go. That system is the Electoral College.

The single best argument against the electoral college is the disaster factor. With a name like that, you know this system cannot be good. Also, 3 high ranking officials and a couple of them that opposed the electoral college, were former presidents. They were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. The electorals confused system works like this. Voters vote for a slate of electors who in turn are the ones who elect the president. Is'nt the whole point of the election to vote for your candidate that you would like to win, and not his employees'? When a state votes for a president and has their majority vote, then the amount of electors in the state are what counts towards the voting polls. The state electors could be anyone not holding office at that time. Furthermore, electoral votes can possible end in a tie due to the fact that there is an even number of electors, 568, which is a big worry in the result of the election. Compared to electoral votes, there is only 55 representatives in California, but there is 35 million people in the state. A tie almost guarenteed, will not happen with that comparison.

A winner take all system is in play with the elcectoral college process. The system consists of when a president wins an election then all electors part or even somewhat representing that candidate are now with the president. Also bigger states have more representatives and the candiates focus more on those staes to try and win them over. it leaves the smaller states like Wyoming and South Dakota, for example, to be left out of the equation and not be focused on too much in the process.

All in all, the elctorall college and process needs to be abolished and is not fair to the people of the nation voting and being taken advantage of.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
3F1900C42C55,"""Do voters really control whom thier elector picks for""(9)we should switch to a direct voting system. With electoral college going voters dont always have control on who the electors from their state pick. In some instanses the electoral voters vote is more valued than the peoples vote. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct vote not an electoral vote.

the electoral vote weighs more than the popular vote, this in unfair because if a mass of people vote for one president and a few electoral voters choose the other president the people dont get the president they wanted, the electoral voters do. So we could expect that a popular vote winner couid yet again lose presidency to the electoral vote. But electoral votes blance out the states say in the vote, if a big state all votes against a small state the big one will win the electoral college balances that, but the popular vote is everyones say not a couple of peoples say.

60% of voters would prefer a direct vote. a direct vote would give the people more voice in the election instead of the few in the electoral college. If we abolish the electoral college the popular vote will be the main vote counted and there will be not more electoral college. Using a direct voting system the people will get the president that they want and voted for(ex. Al Gore)

If the elecrotal vote goes to a tie then it goes to the house of representatives and there each state has one representataive, that one person is voting for thousands of people. That one representative can go against their states wishes and vote for whom ever they choose,So this could lead to bribing the rep into voting for some one else. So the popular vote doesnt help the president get selected.

This is why we should swich to a direct voting system. So the people have more say in who gets to be their president for the next four years. The popular vote cannot be bribed or altered. And the popular vote is everyones vote, not a few or even one persons decision.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5C503E0A2A01,"Dear State Senator,

Sir I would like to point out the fact that the Electoral College is a flawed, outdated system that serves no real purpose in today's world, however it is beautifully American. When the Electoral College was first established it was because we wre a country divided, not in idealogy but physically. We wre a great nation that didn't have electronic voting, the Electoral College was an institution of the people by the people. The folks that were chosen to pick our next President could have been your neighbour or your doctor or even you, yourself. In today's modern, connected world it may seen unnecessay but this established intstutitution of voters voting for voters is still needed. If we switched directly to  a modern vote the wait times on a new POTUS would be unbelievable. Losers could claim fraud because of the electronic voting. Every election would now seem like the fiasco in 2000. It would make 2004 seem like a fair election and 1888 wouldn't even be remembered.

I do believe that the ""winner takes all"" system could be tweaked a little to catch up to modern time and that states like Maine and Nebraska are on to something. Minorities in bigger states such as Republicans in California and Democrats in Texas need a voice. An uneven number of votes is also needed to end the possibility of a tie. There needs to be more clear cut rules on what to do.

Ultimately Senator I do not believe that the total disbandment of the Electoral College is neccesary, a reform may be needed as technology progresses. Something that does need a total overhaul is Floridad's new Common Core and gratuation requirements.

B94E4F75BA1D,"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College is filled with electors that people from different states voted for. They are the people who vote and elect the president and vice president. Their votes are more imprtant than everyone elses because they are higher people than everyone else. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. They need 270 electoral votes on a president before the elect one. Every candidate the is running for president had their own group of electors, so of course they gonna vote for them and thats not fair.

I think that each candidate shouldnt have their own electors because it wouldnt be fair if one candidate had 20 electors and another candidate has like 10. Bascially the candidate with the most electors has a better chance of winning the election. Each state has a group of electors that vote for their state and thats not right. It shouldnt be up to the electors to vote for their state, everyone should just be able to vote for who they want to be president and see what happens from there. Not everything is up to the electors.

We shouldnt keep the Electoral College because its not fair that their votes matter more than the communitys. Everyone in the world is able to vote for who they want for president. Then finally when a president is elected most people are angry because the Electoral College picked who they wanted and didnt pay much attention to the communitys vote. Instead of the Electoral College voteing and choosing the president it should be up to the community. After everyone has voted, we should just add up who got the most votes and whoever did should be elected as president. It shouldnt be up to the Electoral College. Just because they are higher then everyone else, they shouldnt just be able to choose who they want for president.

Also not everyone is able to vote, and thats not fair. The Electoral College adds there votes to everyone elses and then elects the president they want. But what about the people who didnt vote? Everyone should have a chance to vote. It wouldnt be fair that the Electoral College elected a president when theres people out there who didnt even have the chance to vote. In source 2 paragraph 14 , it says,

""its offical: the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational""

. That is true, they arent fair because they make it so that their votes are more important than everyone elses. Most people dont even vote for president, they vote for electors in the Electoral College so they can vote for president. I bet that everytime the Electoral College voted for a president people from different states yelled and screamed at them.

So the best thing is to pay attention to who everyone in the United States is voting for instead of the Electoral College. If we keep voting like this sooner or later everyone is going to get fed up with it and do something about it themselves.

FF489A3E4041,"The Electoral College is America's current method of election. A process created by our founding fathers that consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Many Americans believe that this method is crucial because it's certainty of outcomes and the way it avoids run-off elections. However many people believe it creates more of a problem than a solution. Problems created under the electoral college system include, big states recieving more attention than small states, the disaster factor, and the winner-take-all method which causes unfairness among voters.

Each state has a different number of electors based on the number of members in it's congressional delegation. A lot of the time bigger states tend to have a larger amount of electors, for example the state of Hawaii has four while the state of texas has 38. This causes more attention to go towards the big states. Another example of this dilema is shown by an excerpt from Bradford Plumer whcih says ""each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, represetning 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to represent the will of the people"".

The current system of election leaves room for multiple disasters to occur. Disasters such as the 2000 fiasco in which Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Another issue caused is a question of the electors loyalty to their candidate. Perhaps the Elector of a certain state decides against the election of their party and casts a deciding vote for whoever they please. This creates an unreliable system they could change the fate of an election in an instant. Even more serious issues could arise such as a state sending two slates of electors which Hawaii did in 1960.

Lastly, the Electoral College is a faulty system because of it's winner-take-all method. Most states have this method in which the winning presidential candidate is awarded all the electors. Due to this the candidates don't spend time int he states they know have no chance of winning, and only focus on tight races in the ""swing states"". As stated in an article by Richard A. Posner ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, icluding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single ad.

All in all, the Electoral College is an unreliable system of election. It causes many issues to arise and is all around unfair to voters. Many important people such as Richard Nixon, and Jimmy carter agree that America should abolish it all together. The issues caused such as unequal attention on states based on size, unfaithfulness of electors, and an unfair winner-takes-all method prove the the Electoral College undeniably, causes more problems than solutions.                                        ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
BA117C57D525,"To the State Senate,

Addressing my ultimate opinion, I believe should change the vote of the Electoral College into a popular-based vote. Examining a large number of articles which has fufilled my understanding of the Electoral College including the process and diverse opinions of the Electoral College. This essay will propose the counterclaim the opposing side of why we should not change the process of vote in the United States and address the counterclaim of why the Electoral College should be changed to a popular vote. In order to understand each side, we must first comprehend the process behind the Electoral College. Posner stated, ""...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"" (3). This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" (Office of the Federal Register, 1). This lets us put down a foundation of the Electoral College as well.

According to Plumer, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (2). This indicates how the tie could carry the vote to the House of Representatives, where the federal judgement takes place of voting for the president. Not only this, but Plumer also stated,""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"" (2). This statement from Plumer strongly imposes the knowledge that this tie carried to the House of Representatives would hardly reflect the will of the people due to census of the population. This article highlighted that the vote in 2000 where the system actually seemed to flaw when Gore recieved a higher popular vote than Bush, however, Bush received a higher electoral vote. In this situation, is this truly fair? This example dipicts how the vote is truly determined on a group of people from the population rather than a vote depending upon the entire nation itself. Plumer stated, ""...the electoral college is unfair to voters...swing states..."" (2). This brings us the idea of the swing states and how the candidates in the winner-take-all system do not bother to go to states they know that they have no chance of winning, which harshly reveals that some votes may be biased from the electors ignoring other states. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer,2). This concludes how biased the Electoral College can be when it comes to ties, representatives, the disaster factor, and a great multitude of concepts and situations where the Electoral College has flawed.

Now, I have also read articles that contained letters that emphasized why the Electoral College should not be changed in any way, due to the ""...Certainty of Outcome...Everyone's President...Swing States...Big States... Avoid Run-Off Elections..."" (Posner, 3). These subtitles are points that Posner focused on that he believes can persuade why the Electoral College is somewhat efficient. In each of these points, I can counter that the certainty of the vote is false due to the fiasco of Gore and Bush in 2000, as well as the concept of the House of Representatives that I mentioned earlier as well. In the factor that Posner mentioned in his point of everyone's president, I do not find this very accurate due to the reason that our vote relies on a slate of electors, not us entirely, as it would in a popular vote. In swing states, it mentions in the article of Plumer that a winner-takes-all method is unfair to voters because electors ignore states that they do not have confidence in winning the vote. A major point that I disagree with would be the point that Posner pointed out with Big States, where he mentioned that,""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" (3). In this, I would argue that this is unfair, because of the inequality of representatives due to population, which is not the voter's decision. In the statement of Avoid Run-off Elections, Posner states that, ""The Electoral College avoids that problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" (3). I find this false due to the reason that the Electoral College is based on a different amount of voters and electors in each state, which in turn is viewed unfair because there is a factor of the swing states once again, explains that some electors choose states over another which lets us show how unfair the Electoral College is, generally speaking.

In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President?    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

But if it was by popular vote then the people that don't vote will make a big impact because you will need more votes to win the election.

I also see it as unfair because the people that voted for one person and the majority is for another person their votes won't have any affect and will be pointless. All the people that vote for one person are useless if the other person wins the majority. With the Electoral College some electors could defy the will of the people and vote for the opposite of what most people voted for. Say the 35 million people in california and 15,000,001 million people vote for one person and 14,999,999 people vote for the other those 14 million peoples votes are pointless with the electoral college and its not fair that the canidate doesn't even get one of those votes.

In conclusion i say just get rid of the electoral college because of all the votes that won't count and all the people that voted and not a single one of their votes goes to who they voted for. If it was by popular vote one person could get majority of the electoral votes but less of the popular votes and if there was no electoral college some of the presidents might not have been president.                                    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
94B72A7C1E6B,"Dear State Senator,

Ever since our founding fathers established in the constitution that the president and vice president votes were determined by electoral college, the founding fathers made a good decision. Electoral College is a process where electors gather for a meeting and count the electoral votes to determine the new president and vice president. The United States should keep Electoral College to determine the president and vice president rather than a popular vote because Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote.

To start off, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than popular votes because electoral college avoids run-off elections. If somebody was running for either president or vice president and they recieved thirty percent in popular votes, nobody would know if the person with thirty percent popular vote would win the election. Electoral College prevents confusion by producing a clear winner. For example, in source 3, the text reads ""Richard Nixon in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992 had only forty-three percent of popular votes but both had three-hundred and plus electoral votes which made them win the election"". The president and vice president make sure our country is running well and that we as a country have no problems. If we were to determine our president and vice president by a popular vote, whoever could kiss up more to the voters would win the election even if the person running doesn't meet up to the qualifacations of the person they are running against. Avoiding a run-off election is very important because no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Also, if a popular vote was how the president and vice president were decided, not as much people would pay attention to voting because voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign of the people running for president and vice president.

Furthermore, Electoral College should continue to determine the president and vice president voting rather than a popular vote because Electoral College is more fair than a popular vote. In 2008 when Barack Obama won his election to become the 44th president of the United States, he didn't win by being the popular canadite, Obama won by his passion to make this country better than it already is. For example, in source 1, the text reads ""The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president"". That way of electing the president is more fair than a popular vote because you need 270 electors to say yes to make you president rather than people making you president by if your popular or not. Electoral College is what keeps our elections fair. There is no other way to elect somebody president becuase no other method will be this successful than Electoral College. After all, Electoral College has been the way to elect the president since the constitution was created. Popular Voting is a bad method if were used to determine the president and vice president because somebody who is running for president can manipulate people to think he or she is a good canidate for president when they really aren't.

To conclude, Electoral College should continue to decide the president rather than popular votes becuase Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than popular votes. Why should we change the way we elect president if this method has been working for over 200 years? Electoral College should continue to decide the presidency for years to come because it works so well. That's why Electoral College will stay as the way to elect the president.

The Electoral College is widley known as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by delcaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not Democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate your actually voting for a slate of electors. Perhaps there is a tie in the electoral vote, then, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives, where state delegations vote on the president. If thats the case then i definetley think we should overthrow the Electoral College because then the election is now in their hands which means we have no control over who is elected at all, it is an unfair process that needs to be taken care of. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and thos electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Yet, the Electoral College still has its defenders. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Now that i have made my point, I would like to add that my opinion isn't the only one that matters but I am positive there are plenty of other people around that agree with my decision. I believe that we should overthrow the Electoral College because it is the most unfair way of voting for our presidential representive and we have no way of controlling it.

DC1DA01985EF,"Dear Mr. Senator,

Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our priviledge to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President and, although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurance of a run-off election, run-off elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods.

Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government. According to Source 2, ""state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?

Unquestionably, the Electoral College is not a sound system for presidential election in the United States. In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is obsurd to remove Americans' right to vote. Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a run-off election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overly-cautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved.

You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. Thank you.

Sincerely,

A67A947BBFB7,"Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? ""of course it will make a diffrence."" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets?

When getting down to the nitty-gritty bits of the Electoral College voting system it is a bit unfair in the ways it works in a whole, but that doesnt mean we have to abolish it and start over. The Electoral College voting system has worked for many years. In stead of just getting rid of the Electoral voting system maybe we should tweek it in a bit that makes everyone happy and makes it completly fair. Each state picks how it gives its Electoral votes, but in most states its a ""winner takes all."" When a state desides its going to be a ""winner takes all"" state, that means when voting all the Electoral votes will go to the canidate with the most amount of elector votes. Instead of using the winner takes all system each electoral votes should be given fairly. When electors votes for its canidates by the people that single Electoral vote should go to that canidate. When doing this people are in-tern voting for there canidate.

Now that they Electoral votes are being distubuted evenly there is a smaller problem we face. Electors are the people who actully vote for our presidential canidate. Very rarely do these electors not choose the canidate based on the amount of votes they have been given, but it does happen. The electors are in a way chosen randomly but most of the time are chosen by the presidential canidate. Often these canidates do the right thing and vote based on votes gifen to him by the public. When these electors vote they are not well regulated. What we should do is have a sort of security system that alows us the make sure our electors do the right thing. instead on relying on someones trust worthyness we should have a system that counts the publics votes. When the elector is done with his final vote we would then see if he voted based on public votes.

We the people are faces with another way of voting. We can vote for whatever canidate we please and when done with we will see how many people voted for each canidate, and whoever has the most wins right? This system would most likely give one the canidates an unfait advantage. When Romney and Obama went head to head in 2012 obama won because the amount of Electoral votes, but if we did it by the number of votes it would have been almost completly tied in votes. since Romeny was born in the south most likely each state in the south would vote for Romney. Since Obama was born in Hawiia there is no state near Hawiia that would have the same oppinion. So when using just plain votes one canidate would most likely have an unfair advantage based on the size and populating of each state going for that presidential canidate.

When suming it all up the Electoral College voting system is in a way a bit unfair, but when using the method given each Electoral vote would be given fairly instead of a winner takes all system. When going for just plain voting it would most likely turn out unfair or a lot of tied runnings. When given the facts the Electoral College is fine as it is but can be unfair and that is why we should use this method in the next following elections.                         ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FF0FCC95E73F,"Dear State Senator ,

The idea of a Electoral College sounds great at first. In all reality you have to look at the facts. People of the United States should choose who they want to for president. Only having a few hundered out of the billions of people doesnt really seem fair to everyone's opinion, I agree that not everyone's opinion is satisfactory to others.

Each candidate running for President in a certain state has their own group of electors. These electors are chosen by the political party of those candidates running. The state laws get involved by only selecting electors by their responsiblilities. So this means not every elector is involved with the process.

We voters help choose our state's electors when we vote for President. When we vote for the person of our choice we are really choosing the electors in that candidate's political party. The ""winner-take-all"" system used in most states, gives the electors to the winning presidential candidate. this system is used in all states except Nebraska and Maine which have the variation of ""proportional repesentation."" The number of electors chosen for your vote will representing your chosen candidate.

Again with the fact of having a Electoral College, the people are not really voting for the President, they are voting for a slate of electors. Then they in turn elect president.

If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for 34 Democratic electors for Kerry. Off chance that those 34 electors won statewide, they would go to Congress and Kerry would in return get 34 electoral votes. These electors can be anyone not holding publice office. Electors have their own opinion rights as well.

Our votes dont always control who the elctors vote for. This causes confusion and arguements that it is unfair in the Electoral College's ways that the people are not always voting for their president because they are giving a slight chance for electors to change that vote.

Popular vote allows the people of the United States to choose what out of the majority is best for the United State's Presidential candidate. Unlike the rules and rights of the Electoral College, the popular vote allows the voters a absolute vote. Everyone's thoughts are put in concideration instead only 270 people out of like I said billions(and growing) population.

The facts show that popular vote in the long-run will be better for the United State's state of government than Electoral College. Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. We should abolish the electoral college.

With Concideration,

A United State's citizen    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1B69CFC93153,"The state senator that is reading this should understand that in my favor keeping the Electoral College is the wise thing to do. It will avoid run-off elections and how it always has a process if something happens and that the process is fair-hence Electoral College would be the best.

To start off, the Electoral College helps with elections be cause it avoids run-off elections. In other words it keeps us from running into problem where neither candidate gets the majority of the the votes cast. For example, in 1968 president Nixon and Clinton in 1992 each had 43 percent of the popular votes but because their electoral votes  was 301 to 370 it does matter so this means it was a run-off election until the percentage of votes changed. The Electoral College soon produces a clear winner. This is just solving a problem where no candidate recieves the majority of votes. Now there is only one con to the Electoral College and that is that it may turn off people from voting because they believe that their vote out of everybody who votes isnt enough to do a difference so they dont even vote. So voters in presidential elections are way better than just one vote deciding an election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College is consisted of 538 electors. The candidate needs atleast 270 to be elected. If they have atleast 270 and there and they are not tied, but they have the same popular votes, also known as a plurality. The Electoral Colleges 538 electors will decide. This is 100 percent fair because those electors study this, they do this for their job, and they understand. They make up for the people who didn't vote. So just think, wouldnt you want 538 professional electors deciding whos president or 538 people who dont even want to vote and dont even know about the campaign to decide whos your president. All the lying about the Electoral College that it is an anachronism is false it is a success. This is common sense if you ask me.

To conclude, the electoral college has been good to us for a long time because of how it handles situations when they go wrong-hence it is the best, why change it now?                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
620419154DDF,"We should go with changing to election by popular vote for president because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century,the system allows for much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousisiana legislature nearly succeded in  replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In the case, the election would be thrown to the house of Representatives, where state delegations vote for president. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode island and South Carolina, and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad.

ED321E901AC7,"The system of the Electoral College is a widely argued debate as to if it should be continued or if it should be gotten rid of. The electoral system shouldn't be used as a system of voting, who honestly wants to vote for someone who will vote for you, and if we are truly a state thats votes for its own president then why doesn't the popular vote count as the offical vote?

The Electoral College is a system that is rather unfit as a system of the people's voting. When you vote for your president, you're really just voting for who you think should vote for them. The article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" states, ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for you candidate's electors."" The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation's properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it's how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."" talks about how you can't control who the electorals you chose vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American. Don't let someone else detain your freedom of speech, let you personal voice be heard by the people.

While the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn't really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don't always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn't really matter, it's like saying you voice doesn't matter to the government. They took away the right as an American they gave you in the first place. Popular vote should replace the Electoral College. There have been instances where the popular vote reined supreme, but the Electoral College didn't agree. In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it mentions an election where Al Gore lost even though he won the popular vote. ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency..."" This helps show the people that it seems our vote isn't what is truly important, it's only what the Electoral College does that makes a true impact on choosing of president for the next two years. It's even stated in the very same article that, ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" If our vote truly matters then why not vote on keeping the Electoral College in play or getting rid of the flawed system once and for all.

The Electoral college is claimed to keep the voting system in line and prevent major mess, however this is not truly the case. There will still be flaws, but this is not the correct way to fix it. Listening strictly to the people's vote is what Amercia was built on and as an American I would like to see a change and let my voice be heard. If I want to vote I will vote, I don't want to vote on someone voting for me.

The Electoral College is unfair, unjust, and unamerican. The system takes away our right to vote for who we want not who we want to vote for us. If you are a true American you will understand why I know this is flawed. The Electoral College is not a proper way to handle our votes it must be a vote decided completely by the people of Amercia.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Knowing that its someone they voted for ad not someone in which the electoral college votes for and decides to make the president. some presidents win the popular vote but still lose the presidency because they didnt get enough electoral votes.

D447CD5A0C67,"Americans throughout the country believe that the Electoral College isn't fair and believe that they deserve a more direct voting syste to the president, other than voting for electors. These reasons are made by the people because they want more and more power in the government. What the people want is almost always the risky option, especially when the topic is government. I believe that the Electoral College should be kept as the way it is now, and not a direct voting system for American citizens.

As said in the previous statement, Americans that want the Electoral College gone are lurking for more power when it comes to rules. Unfortunately, if the government's decisions were left in the hands of the people, the country's state would be in anarchy. On the other hand, the electoral college offers Congress and the Senate a share of the power, and the American citizens a share of the power as well. For example, if the Electoral College began to diminish, then became wiped out immediately, the government could do nothing less but to watch as the people choose the president that they want. Sometimes, what is wanted by the people may not always be the right thing.

Moving on, almost 60 percent of all American voters stated that they would rather have a direct voting system, putting aside the Electoral College. What most people are not seeing is that the direct voting and Electoral College system are very similar. The difference between the two is, that when Americans vote in the Electoral College, they are voting for electors that go towards the president, and when Americans vote directly to the president, those same amount of votes go to the president as well. If the voting system was based off of a direct route to the presidents side, then there would be too many votes to count, which is why have representatives towards each state is one of the glories of the Electoral College.

Finally, the popular voting system is very flawed, considering that there are states that have millions more people people than others. Some states even double the size of other states according to population. For example, New York's population most likely doubles the population of Florida's, but thanks to the Electoral College, the representative and population ratio weighs out, giving each state an equal amount of votes toward their president. Now, if the popular voting system was in place, then states like New York would outnumber states like Florida's votes by millions. It would not be as fair as it is now if the popular voting system replaced the Electoral College.

In conclusion, the Electoral Colllege has many positive outlooks like keeping the voting system fair and not giving too much power to either side when voting is the subject. Although many Americans believe that the Elecotral College is causing the wrong presidents to win, it does not make a difference either way because of the way that the Electoral College evens out the votes.

That is a lot of people who just want a more trustworthy and direct voting process. The Electoral College should be abolished because you can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all.

Having your trust in people who you only see campaigns for on television is pretty hard to do. Honestly that is quite ridiculous for them to ask of us. In source 2, paragraph 11, Plumer tells us about how sometimes ""faithless"" electors disregard their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please.  So is it really worth going through the trouble of electing poeple who might not even do as they said they would. Posner on the other hand explains that the trust in the elector is rarely betrayed (source 3, paragraph 16). But is it really worth risking four, maybe eight years of our lives to trust poeple we really do not know. Not to mention how it could affect our jobs and lives at home if this does happen.

Did you know seventeen states didn't see any candidates at all in the 2000 campaign. In source 2, paragraoh 13, Plumer talks about how candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win. This leaves many states who do not get to see any candidates at all. This makes those states feel like their votes do not count and worry if they their new president willl have any regards for their interest. In source 3, paragraph 19, Posner says that this is a good thing that candidates do not visit states they know the can't win or states that they know they will definintly win because then that candidate can focus on the states that may be undecided or swing states. He believes this is a good thing because a candidate with appeal in only a few states is unlikely to be a good president. But you are leaving out a big proportion of the United States population who would love the expiernce of hearing a cadidate give a passionate speech about why he\she should be elected.

We can come to the conclusion that the Electoral College should be abolished because you really can't trust the people you elect, and many states do not even see any electors at all, which then makes them feel worthless.

Taking away the electoral college would make alot of people angry. Having an electoral college makes it ten times easier for the government. Having an electoral college makes it more fair for citizens and having the majority people agree, alot its alot easier for the governement to see who the people want to lead us and lastly there will be alot less arguments from citizens because if they dont agree they cant do anything about it because majority rules.

Having an electoral college makes it alot more fair for citizens to vote. The electoral college is a process that consists of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president. Choosing a president and voting for him/her make sthe citizens agree. When it comes down to voting day the citizens have to come to a majority to rule. Having the votes sent to congress and them deciding is very fair because they can decide the final dicison for the citizena dn who tehy think the citizens want more.

The electoral college has 538 electors, so its not like 2 people can decide the president. Having an elecotral college makes it alot easier to decide for the government. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. One for each member in the house of representatives plus 2 for you senators. The presidential election is held every 4 years so people have time to decide if they want to re elect or to keep the current president.

Electoral elections have less argument between the citizens. If you took electoral college away people would be starting riots about who to choose. Having this system is very organized and prepared, if you just take away and start something new its going to be a mess. Electoral college is a very mature way in electing president. Citizens dont have to argue because the majority rules all so they cant fight someone because they didnt pick who they wanted

THose are the reasons on why they should not take away electoral college!!It makes it more fair! its makes it easier to decide! Lastely its less arguments with citizens about who won!

5AC1F5990079,"Dear senator,

Many people argue that the electoral system is unfair to the voters but it's actually the opposite of that. I mean for starters most voters are easily manipulated and indecicive, If we choose the vote by popularity method it'll cause more of a problem then what we have now, and lastly not many people actually care for voting.

""The mob is stupid"". This is what my 7th grade civics people told everyone. People are easily tricked. Just got a nazi germany for example. People belived in his philosophy and led to Germanys down fall. Anybody could appeal to anybodys needs. All you have to say is what the people want to hear. How you conduct yourself and how you talk is all you need to make some one on your side or to catch a vote. The electoral system is basically a back up defense in this type of a situation.

In addition, a ""popular vote wins"" election it'll cause' way more chaos than you could imagine. Like during the 2012 election obama only recieved 51.3% of votes. Can you belive that? Just 1.3% short was the opponent and you actually belive not only the people but Mitt Romney would accept his loss? He'd obviously demand for a recount and possibly even be calling so and so for being corrupt and it would be a wild two months if not four years .

Lastly, many people do not care for voting which not only decreases the number to manipulate makes it harder for an election to be one sided. About half of americas population actually vote on elections which actually increases the odds of tight races.

To wrap this up i belive the electoral system should be kept not only does it safeguard against the manipulation of the people it also helps keep elections smooth and run properly and prevents chaos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
DCDE1C43C218,"Every 4 years, the first Tuesday in November. When its time for it, president elections is one of the most hectic times of the year. But what should the winner depend on? Electoral College should be removed by the government and just have popular vote be responisble. Electoral College can have electors go on the opposite canidates side so they lost a vote, which is just wrong. This argumentative essay will argue why Electoral  College should be taken out by government.

One may say that Electoral College is the best system for voting, but then again that may just be the cheaters. Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..""(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

Even though there are people who support the Electoral College, there are many people who are against it. In source three, Posner states ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.""If one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?""""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.""(Plumer, paragraph 11). Not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. For example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. Electoral College also may not be fair to those in a small state. ""a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does..."", as said by Posner. Its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won't really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. Electoral College is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote.

To conclude the argument, Electoral College should forsure be removed. Citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. Candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. Why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. Citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. Take out Electoral College, and let the voters vote, actually count.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
A49E1A5FA91B,"Dear State Senator,

I am writing you a letter in regards of the electoral college. I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. While it is a good system, it is not reliable and does not let the people truly decide who their representative will be. It does bring some certainty of outcome but not as much as it should.

The electoral college must be abolished because it does not let the people truly decide who their president will be. While it does allow them to vote for a slate of electors who then elect the president usually based off of the popular vote, they do not always vote for who they are supposed to. The slate of electors that the people vote for are supposed to be trusted to vote for what the popular vote says, they do not always do so. A good example of that is in 2000, when Al Gore ran against George W Bush. Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide over Bush, he still didnt win the presidency because the electoral college did not stay true to their word and voted for Bush. That is because, as shown in Source 3, paragraph 15, "" When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference, it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate.

Although the electoral college does bring better certainty of outcome than a popular vote, it does not have the certainty it claims to have. In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.

So because the electoral college is obviously unfair, it should be abolished. Because the voters are told they decide who reopresents them, yet they do not. There is a possibility, while slim that a president could win the popular votes, yet lose the election because of the way the electoral college is set up. So because it unfair to the presidential candidates, it should be abolished and we should have elections controlled by popular votes.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1471E7AA9035,"I claim that it would be better if the Electoral college would stay the same .And the reason why it should stay the same its because the the way its been going but it has been also having some small problems but they are also reasons hwy it should stay the same.

The problem is that if you want to vote for president you can't because you are going to have to vote for aleast 34 Democratic and they elct the president,not you. And the electors are the onnes that are not holding public office. the other promble is that it also depends on the state you are living on because that is it dependson who picks the electors. The ones that mostly pick them are states conventions,party's central committee or even sometimes the presidential candidates themeselves.

I claim that it should stay the same because of these reason, Certainty of outcome , in 2000 it was possible that the dispute over the outcome if an Electoral College vote and around the 2012's the election , obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to oly 51.3 percent and that was alot. also the college had to restores some of the weight in the political blance that large states lose by  virtue of the mal apportionment, wich the senate decreed in the consitution. There wasa method that the Elecotral college use and that was that to select the president that will turn off the potential voters for a candidate,there are five reasons for retaining the electoral collega despite its lack of democratic pedigree.

In passage 3 it says that the Electoral College has consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president and  one for each member in the houseof respresentatives plus two for your senators and the presidential election mostly is held or four yeas on the tuesday after the first monday in november and i think that is doing a great job one elctions,electors, and on picking the president. also thats why i think its better if the electoral college stays the same.

If they we'er to ask me, I would absolutly say ""Yes The Electroal College should be removed."" But many people ask ""why?"", to me it's simple.

They always go to people who decide weather or not they should be approved, wich abviously the should if their whole or majority of the state voted for him/her.

59819F0DAB63,"Dear senator,

I think for electing the president of the united states we should use popular vote because, sometimes certain presidents got more popular votes but the electoral college voting gave them president with the least popular votes with the election and they became president.

In the election between Gore and Bush, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush still became president because of the electoral college voting system it needs to be changed. States with smaller electoral college voters don't have as much say in who's gonna become president,most of the states don't have more than 10 electoral college voters for them but, in the bigger states like califorina,texas,and florida have the most electoral college voters so they bascilly control who's gonna become president.

This is why I think the electoral college voting system should be removed because of its bad way of helping the united states in picking a president and sometimes it can help a bad person become president and ruin this country since it's mostly polticans who are the electoral college voters and they could just pick the person they want to be president and that person could be a horrible president.

9EF0CA47A564,"Dear Mr. Senator,

It has caught my attention that "" The Electoral College"" may not be the best suit voting system for our nation. The people expect a Democracy were every single vote counts. Unfortunetly that right is being stripped away, for the goverments own good. We go to vote for a fellow canadite, not a slate of electors. Electors in which are not guarenteed to to vote for your desired canidate. The states seem to over look the fact 60% of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind they have now.

Under the electoral college system, we the voters do not vote for president we vote for the electors,based on popular vote we choose the electors that repersent our state, that elect the president for us. The people involoved in the elections are those with political preferences, and it is not fair to strip them of there right to vote directly for the leader of the free world. For example many men and women follow the election when it comes time every four years, to see who is going to be the best head of house, he best comander and cheif, and the best leader of our country. The president should be a person the people respect and trust with everything they have. But unforutnetly the Electoral College does the deciding for us, all the devotion of politics and reaserch for our favorite candidates goes to waste.

In additon the next vaild argument against the electoral college is what many may call the disastor factor. Consider the fact that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors who could always defy the will of the people. For example in the 1960's the Loisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors that oppposed John F. Kennedy. And in the same cercumstance other electors have occasionally refused to vote for there party'd candidate and vote for whom ever they please. Yet perhaps one of the most worrying things is the situation in which the electoral vote becomes a tie. In that case the election would be given to the house of representatives. In which, the state delegations vote for the president and the senate elects the vice president. Beacuse each state only cast one vote, the single represenetive of california represents 35 million people. Hardly able to reflect on the will of the people.

To conclude, the electoral college is unfair, untrustworthy, and bias. This great nation is a democracy, the people choose . Not the representitives of the candidates who do not always express the will of the people. I must agree with my fellow 60% of voters in there desire to iradicate the electoral college.

EC145DC83EBE,"Dear state senator

I think having popular votes would be better 3 reason why I say this is because Electoral Colleges has selection of electors witch makings them vote for the President/Vice President. The second reason why i pick popular is because when it is Electoral Colleges voters vote not for president but for slate of electors and thats who picks the president. The last reason why we should vote by popular is because Electoral College is unfair.

To start off with why we should have popular votes is because Electoral Colleges process consists the selection of the electors and has a meeting with the electors where they vote for the President and Vice president. Electoral Collegeonly consists of 538 electors but majority of 270 is required to elect the President.

Another reson why i picked popular voting is because with popular votes the citizens are voting for who they want to be their President and who they want to be their Vice President but in Electoral College electors pick and vote for who they think would be the best President for instance if you lived in Texas and want to vote for John Kelly you would have to vote for slate 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kelly in Electoral College but in popular voting you could  vote for anyone you wanted to and not someone who pledged that person.

The third reason why popular voting would be better is because Electoral College was unfair, outdated, and irrational and had lack of democratic and is also a turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states like them knowingtheir votes will have no effect witch makes them pay less attention to Electoral College voting.

This is all the reason why the state senator should choose populae voting over Electoral College voting.              ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
00B2AE3212D2,".

Senator i believe the electoral college should be consider changed by congress because of the many people in this great country wouldnt trust electors for voting. I think every single confirmed vote should be counted and registered because that is the true meaning of voting for something or someone .Out of the 538 elector it would be a lie not to think one of them had a favorite or been bribed or rigged elections i think its hard to trust a bunch of men and women who a majority of the states no nothing about. Ialso think swing states should be considered like every other state there is instead of calling them ""toss-up states"" that anyone could over take .

Even as the text says Who are the electors, they can someone not holding a public State office, who picks them , and we cant even vote on who the electors should be.

The system is a disaster in it's self why are we taking a million public citizen votes and only letting one man or women ""Turn it in"" its non-democratic and it has no real use this off i completely disagree and do not feel that the electoral college is needed it seems like a waste of our U.S money and puts us in debt by paying these 538 people Tons of cash to vote on something a simple as Voting. now there is only one thing i believe is right in the voting system is that big state (size and population) does deserve the bigger ammount of electoral votes then smaller states like Florida, New York ,California ,Texas and many other states Since the population is so dense

By changing the voting system to popular vote i think makes people feel more involved in whats actually happening instead of just one measly vote. people complain about other people who dont vote well thats one of the reasons why 1 person out of a 4.5 million population state no one would care cause then those go right to the electoral college then thats what actually matters so at the end of the day people could careless who ran the nation. But at the end of the night anyone who knows about the electoral college wants it to be changed                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

How that works is when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate elector.

After the elcetion has ended your governor takes it time for the ""centificate of Ascertaniment"" for all the candidact ran for the preisdent .

College voting method is the most easiest method to use. All we have to do is vote and who ever gets the most votes win. I think its just a fair method to use. I feel like the other method is just to complex so we should stick to the college voting method. almost half of the time to president we choose is the right president for the US.

Another reason we should keep the college method is because it wouldnt take that long. All we really just have to do is vote and in no time our president will be in office.

E03ACCEF14C2,"It isn't fair to let someoe vote for someoe and then for said someone that that they voted for swing and vote for someone else that the person didn't lean to vote for. In my own opinion, we should get rid of the Electoral College, because we sometimes do not get what we voted for.

Why have electoral votes that may not get the president you want? In paragraph nine of Source Two it states how over sixty percent would prefer a direct election. So the question is, why not do it? Sixty out of one hudred percent would prefer it, so why not atleast give it a try? Having a whole state have to decide what party to choose from doesn't seem fair. Ifwe had a direct election, then the President with the most votes out of the whole country would be the rightful President. It seems as if the Electoral College isn't quite acurate.

Getting rid of the Electoral College would change the U.S. a lot. It hopefully would be a good change. If it was gone, we could all hope that we would get whom we wated in office by a direct election. In paragrapgh four-teen, Source Two, it says that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" The outdated part of that sentence is true. The electoral College was enforced in 1888 and has since been used by voters today. It's time for a change and a direct election should be that change. What is so bad that could happen?

The Winner-Take-All method would be gone. Voting in an Electoral College is like voting for your vote to have the most votes, like in school, you want to pick what game you play so you vote and whatever has the most, you play. Except in voting for Presidency your vote goes to whatever your state has the most of. Which seems unfair. You basically just vote to vote, so It's only a big win for you if what party you voted for is what your state goes with.

The staes determine who is the President during an election. The electoral votes have an effect on the state. 538 electors throughout the whole country. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. According to Source One, your state is entilted to how many members in cogress you have, plus two for each senator.

46527BA000FB,"In every presidential election, thousands of americans vote for their most favorite candidate, however, most voters feel that their votes don't count because a process called the Electoral College are the ones who are voting. I have heard that since people have been rioting in protest for a change, you the state senator will ask the government to abolish the Electoral College. Unfortunately, we can't let that happen, the Electoral College is very important to presidential elections because provide the certainty of outcome, allows the presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states,and avoid run-off elections. Without the Electoral College, the elections would be a mess.

First, the Electoral College is important because they give the certainty of outcome. For example, the Electoral votes of a winning candidate exceeds the popular votes he gets. While both votes have disputes on the outcome, the Electoral votes very rarely get disputed. For example in 2000 Al Gore had the most popular votes but lost because Bush had more Electoral votes. If there was no Electoral College, the winners of many campaigns would be their opponents.

Next, the Electoral College is important because it requires the presidential candidates to have transregional appeal. For example if a president decided to only do his campaign in one region, there wouldn't be enough electoral votes to give him the win. This means that the candidates have to spread their campaigns throughout the country not only for enough Electoral votes but to have the people in the other regions feel that the president will have regard of their interests.

Next, the Electoral College is important because Allows the candidates to focus their efforts on the toss-up states. For example, in toss-up states, the voters are more likely to pay attention to the campaign. Because of this, the voters will pick the most respectable of the candidates. Since the Electoral College allows this, people in toss-up states will listen to the candidates, review the information about each one and decide on which one to vote for. If it weren't for the Electoral College, the candidates would be clueless on which states would rank up the popular vote.

Finally, the Electoral College is important because it avoids run-off elections. For example the Electoral College avoids the problem of all candidates not getting a majority of the votes. If there is a run-off election, it would complicate the entire process, but since there is an Electoral College, they provide a clear winner.

If there was only popular votes, the change of run-off elections would go up causing problems in the election.

Many people in this country also believe that the Electoral College is important, however many others do not. I am a person that believes that the Electoral College is needed because of certainty of outcome, requiring the candidates to have transregional appeal, focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states, and avoiding run-off elections. I write this letter to you, the state senator to not give up hope on the Electoral College.

F374D1361BBB,"Dear state senator,

It has come to my attention that there has been some debate on whether or not our nation should continue to use the Electoral College to elect our presidents. Despite the claims that this method is outdated and unfair, I believe that we should keep it in use. The presidental election is held every 4 years and has addressed all issues that may occur.

One such concern would be if a candidate won the popular vote but did not win the presidency as shown here "" This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.""(source 2). This does seem rather odd considering the seemigly non-democratic nature of this process however, there is a explanation for this. When a person votes for a candidate using the Electoral College, they are actually voting for a slate of electors who in turn vote for a nominee. The reasoning behind this is that a larger state such as California, has a much larger population that a smaller state such as Utah. If we were to chose by popular vote, California would have a very unfair advantage over Utah. While some might then say that the system is still very biased, no one group has any advantage over another as shown here, ""All are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" (source 3).

Another concern was what the outcome would be if both candidates had equal votes. This problem can again be solved by using the Electoral College. While this is very rare it can also lead to pressure for a run-off election which would make the election process extremely difficult. Electoral College is an efficient producer of an obvious winner. If you still do not believe that the Electoral College is truly ""fair"", we have even allowed Columbia to vote as shown here, ""Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College."" (source 1). To close off, I would greatly appreciate if you would consider this letter.

EB901EEC8E98,"Dear Senator,

Its official, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, ans irrational.  A direct election would make it fair to most states and it wouldnt matter on the amount of electors.

The electoral college depends on the popular vote so the you are only voting for the electors not the actual canidates if you think about it.  Each states gets a certain amount of electors depending on the population of that state.  For example,

California gets 55 electors while Florida only gets 29.  So the presidents wont eben care to show up to places Alabama with only 9 electors.  They would only go to the bigger populated states and try and win their votes and not worry about the rest of the country.

If we had a direct election more of the people vote would count and it wouldnt matter about the electors in the states.  The citizens would actually be voting on the canidates.  This is a much more fair system to include everyone into and have an accurate election.

In the end, you should realize how uneccessary the electoral college is and how the direct election is a more fair way to get accurate results.  This way we would have much less issues and the elections would take place in all states and not just the ones with more electors.

3D7740BCAA23,"State senator.....Keeping the Electoral College would greatly benifit our country.  The electoral process is a very important process that is needed.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.  With majority of 270 votes are needed so there is a good chance of getting a fair shot to win.  Each candidate running for president in a state has to have there own group of electors which eguals out the odds.  The electors are chosen by the candidates political party.  In most states they have a winner takes all system but Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportion.

The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidate in the state and shows which electors will be representing your state at the metting of the electors which helps us to know who had won the presidental election.  Voting for a state election of who will turn elected for president. When voting you would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors to pledge for Kerry.

Voting for a president is like voting for a state elector.  Even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it has only happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate shares the Electoral College invariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.  The Electoral college requires an apresidental candidate to have transregional appeal.

The residents of the other religions are likely to feel disenfranchised and that their votes does not count and that the new president will have know regard for their interests.  That he is not really there president.  The winner of all methods of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates like as seen in the election of 2012.  They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate as the most thoughful voter should be the one to decide the election.

The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constituion.  Having the electoral College avoids the problem of electiong in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potental voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example or Republicans in California.

Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.  As some would say the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are most likely assertions without much basis in reality.     ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

043E9B5AFC5F,"Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens. I think that we should change the way we vote by changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. I feel that this is a good idea and a good way to vote, let me tell you why. It's a good idea because it benefits the public, everyone knows exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it doesn't mess up the votes and or voting. Let's continue, shall we?

It's a good idea because it benefits to the public. The public wants to know exactly who and what they are voting for, they want to know exactly what their vote means to the election. More than half of the time they don't notice what kind of an impact a vote can make or what exactly they are voting for. Also when they do elect a President, the end up getting mad over their finances or taxes because the President trhat they voted for affected it in a negative way. They wanted to elect him because they wanted a better economy, to benefit them, not to restrict them from not having what they want. This is only my first reason, I have two more to go.

Another reason of why I believe that it's a good idea is because it let's the public know what kind of impact they're exactly making on the election. We all don't want to vote and not know what kind of impact our vote can make. We want to know that we can make a difference on who we're voting for, or who we vote for. They want to know and be sure if they vote for lets say ""Billy Henderson"" that he will lower gas prices and boost the economy, make this world a better place and help all the needy, instead of ""Robert Metinguey"" who will maybe to this and maybe do that. We want to know for sure what we're voting on and how much of a difference it can make. Not to be worried about if it won't happen.

The last reason I have to give for why this a good idea is so that it does not mess up the voting process. According to the Gallup pole in the 2,000, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popluar vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what im talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote.

Well, there you have it. My reasons are final. I feel that we should change the voting process because it would benefit the public, so everyone can know exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it does not mess up the voting process. Don't do it for the government. Do it for your own sake. If you wanna make a difference, be on my side, and we can. Together. Now my only question to you is, are you willing to make a difference?            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
0E8939D81B95,"Dear senator,

I think keeping the electoral college is pointless. What is the point of having us vote if the electoral college are the ones who get too decide based on our votes. I defend the idea of allowing the popular vote to decide who our president is. I am in agreement with Bob Dole so he says, ""Abolish the electoral college!"" Like stated in the article, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

As read i the passage, ""knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..."" Which brings be back to why the electoral college is irrelevant. The more we feel our vote doesn't count the less were going to care. If majority of us want a democratic president or a republican president, let that be our decision. For all we know the electoral college could just be in favor for a republican president rather than a democratic president and vice versa.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states, as stated in the article. We voters dont even vote for our president, we vote for a slate of elector, who actually elect the president. SO then again our vote doesn't even matter, which makes us upcoming voters not even want to vote. Knowing that my vote doesn't really count.

214A19342774,"The Electoral College is a easy, yet hard way of a candidate becoming the President of the United States. The Electoral college was created by how ever many majority of the electoral votes will become the new president. This brings many issues within the U.S. . The popularity vote does not matter in a situation like this and is not likely relied on to decide who the president will be. The Electoral College is not right, it's unfair, and is very controversial. The argument though is that with the Electoral College the votes which are dominant have a better chance of the two nominees not having the same amount of votes rather than if it was relied on by the popularity votes. This still though does not resolve nor question that the Electoral College needs to be replaced.

Initially, the Electoral College is not right at all. The electoral votes in the U.S. combined throughout all the states equals 538 votes. Popularity votes which are votes that have an advantage of the election are more than tens of thousands if not more. This is an example on how the Electoral College works. An example of this is in the source by ""Reasons to keep our despised method of chooosing the President"" it states, "" Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 42 percent of the popularity vote but won through the electoral votes because they had bigger states voting for them making them win that election"". This shows how the Electoral College is not right and should reverse the value of electoral and popularity voting(Poshner, 22).

Additionally, the Electoral College voting is very unfair because many sources giving have shown to people that many candidates have had less popularity vote but have won through the majority of the electoral votes. This is unfair because popularity votes mean popularity votes which are votes that are of the majority of all votes. Unfortunately, the popularity votes do not count. As said in the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states, "" if you wanted to vote for John Kerry and you lived in Texas the vote would go to 34 Democratic electors that pledged to Kerry"". This is why popularity vote should be the deciding factor of who becomes the next President. If every election would be based on popularity vote the candidate won each of those elections would probably all change due to the fact that so many elections have won based on electoral vote(Plumer,10).

To end with, the Electoral College is so controversial. Out of more than two hundred years of elections many have been close and many have been a mile away from each other. The electoral vote decides it all though. The main problem with this process is how it is set-up. The electoral vote is dominent over the popular vote, but it shouldnt be. The electoral vote has made bad decisions yet good decisions throughout the hundreds of years its been around and the main reasin for electoral votes are to keep the candidates running not have the same number of votes so that they won't have to have another election and voting cast. ""It is also really controversial since the voting also might rely on the political party that the candidate is running for"", as  stated by ""What is the Electoral College"". This Electoral College seems to go by how big the state is, the bigger the state the more electoral votes that state has; the smaller the state the less electoral votes that that state has(Federal Register, 5).

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unaccurate, lazy, unreasonable, yet successful. This process by many sources of evidence have concluded that there are in fact many holes in this system. Yet some sources have proved how the Electoral College has helped decide the outcomes and have stopped run-off elections. The Electoral College is unfair, not right and controversial and has also proved that it has pros to all these cons as well.     ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Because small states only get a small number of electoral votes canidates do not visit the small states that often. So how is that fair?

My second reason is why not just let the poplar vote choose who is the president? After all the poplar vote is the only honest way of doing things. The canidate that has the most votes in a poplar vote should win every time. That way is fair.

65FC63395709,"Dear Senator,

Keeping the electoral college would be a disater just waiting to happen. It is old, out-dated and irrational. Are we really going to keep using the same, old method that our founding fathers used hundreds of years ago? The method itself is unfair to many American voters. It is also unjust to the canidates who won the popularity vote, but not the electoral vote.

The canidates running for presidency usually focus on the bigger states with more electoral votes or ""swing"" states. This makes the voters in smaller states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina feel like their opinions and voices do not matter, that the president will not care for their interests. Having the electoral college gone, means that the winner-take-all system will also be gone, and will insure voters that the canidates will spend more time in their states trying to win their votes as an individual and not as a whole.

In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gone recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush, but lost the presidency, because he did not recieve the majority of the electoral votes. This is unfair to the canidate, knowing that you won majority of the populations votes, but lost the presidency. In an article called "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" Mother Jones stated that after the 2000 presidential race, a poll was taken, over sixty percent of voters would prefer a more direct election than the one we have now.

In another article ""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", they argue as to why we should keep the electoral college. The author of the article, Richard A. Posner, said that there is a certainity of outcome, that the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. That being said, it shows that the voters' vote do not really matter, because it all comes down to the electoral votes.

Despite the numerous amount of people who disagree with the Electoral College and all the agruements against it, we still keep it. Why? What is so bad about getting rid of the Electoral College?

Around my community, there has been a lot of talk about how the president should be elected into office. Whether it is from the electorial college or by popular vote. This is a very important matter to me because it can change how our country is. In my opinion, it should be by the electorial college. I'm not saying the elctorial college is the right way but I would really like if you can look into it.

My question to you Mr. senator is why you wouldnt want to take the process of the electorial college to pick a president? All of the pieces seem to fall into place. So isnt it the obvious choice? See, the person who gets the most ammount of votes gets to be the president. Thats as simple as it can get. And in my opinion, it is as fair as it gets. It is also not a democratic method of selecting the next person in office.

So Mr. Senator, all i want you to do is look into the elctoral college. It is obviously the right choice. So please, make the whole community happier and use the better way.

807D6A3A679D,"America was built upon the foundation known as democracy, yet we have been desecrating on what we believe in for years. I am talking about the elctoral college, the process of picking a president or senator through voting for what an elector decides on and acts as a representative for what a certain region decides to vote for. From the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the elctors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral vites by Congress."" I do not believe that the elctoral college is a wise decision as it being the process of voting for our next leader.

Many people disagree with my opinion and there are a few reasons why, that even I support. From the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president,"" by Richard A. Posner, he states that the outcome is certain when applying electoral college to a vote, while a dispute can be more likely to occur using the popular vote method. However, thye elctorial college can even decrease the percentage of voters in the country. There are Democrats in Texas while California has Republicans. This means that there are elctors who already know what they're voting for and the candidates only visit ""swing"" states or states who have no preference on what party they are voting for. This will decrease the chance of voters to vote in a state that already knows what party the electors of their state will vote for.

I agree on the basis that vote by popular election is more applicable to the situation of voting rather than by electoral college. One reason is the mess-up that occured on the presidential election voting in 2000. The problems of the electoral college is the reason why Florida screwed up and George Bush became president rather than Al Gore, who won the popular vote. Taken from the Article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer,""Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

Another reason as stated by Plumer's article,""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What would happen if there is a tie on the votes the elector gets? Would the elector simply choose one or the other or might not even vote at all. I also believe that it is unfair that each state gets the number of electors based on the population of the state. If California was Republican while Idaho could be for Democrats, then both do not have an equal value because California has more people. Overall, electoral college seems sophisticated but whatever happened to being ""plain and simple?"".

Voting through the popular vote method seems much easier and much better than voting within a certain region counts as one vote. It would be much simpler if every vote of every single person counted as it's own vote for the president, not for an elector. This makes your vote not seem that worthy and is the cause of discouragement of voting. From the Office of the Federal Register it states that, ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" There is proportional representation or statistics involved, simply who gets more takes it and it would be unfair to each person with this method.

In conclusion, the elctoral college is an out-dated process for electing a president and should be changed to whoever, wins the popular vote because deep-down, the people are the key figure in voting.

The first reason is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now. The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The last reason is because the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters.

The first reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes,is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the Electoral College still has it's defenders. That was the first reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The second reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes, is because under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, butr for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So the Electoral College usually wins since the votes go in to the House of Representatives first, which is really unfair to the other people that are doing the election. That was the second reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

The last reason why I think that they need to change the Ellectoral College to election by popular votes, is because at the most basic level, the Electoral College is unfair nto voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. But it's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arrguments in favor of it are mostly asserstions without much basis in reality. That was the last reason why they should change the Electoral College to election by popular votes.

State senator i'm writing you this letter so you can hopefully change the Electoral College to election by popular votes. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. so the only last words that I have to say to you are: Abolish the Electoral College!

13D83C05F4D8,"The Electoral College is not a place, but a process. It was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The college consists of electors, which vote for President and Vice President. The College consit of many electors, about 538 that is. There is a certain number of votes that is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president is his or her own group of electors. The candidate's political party usually chose the electors. Election is held every four years in November on the first Tuesday. There is usually something called a ""winner-take-all"" system, it awards the winners of the presidential candidate. People should agree of keeping the Electoral College because without it, countires would not have presidents or vice presidents. Most people don't understand the use of the Electoral College. I think that there should be someone going out to jobs and schools talking to the the new generation and the people with jobs about this Electoral College. Under the electoral college system, voters vote, not for president, but for a state of electors, so what do you think our country would look like without this? For instance if you lived in Texas, and you wanted to vote for David Mark, you'd have to vote for about 34 Democratic electors pledged to Mark. People always seem to argue about this Electoral College, we calll it a disastor factor. American's should consider them selves lucky for the big election crisis that happened in a century. Some people think the electoral college is unfair to voters, only because of the winner-take-all system. During one of the campaigns, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. People say that the electoral college is unfair; outdated, and irrational.

Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee.

There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College;

1) Certainly of Outcome- A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible 2) Everyone's President- The electoral College requires as presidential candidate 3) Swing States- The winner-take-all system of awarding the electoral votes induces the candidates 4) Big States- The electoral college restores some of the wight in the political balance.

5) Avoid run-off elections- The electoral college avoids the porblem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

People still continue to argue about the Electoral College method of selecting the president. that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state Democrats. The Electoral College is a good thing. Vote for President and Vice President and your country will be on top.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

He did not become president because the ellectoral college voted for the other person. That is unfair because no matter what the citizens say, they are not even completly sure that the president they voted for was going to win. For example, in the year 2000, a little bit after Al Gore, they won the popular vote, but they did not win the presidency because they did not win the electoral vote, according to Source 2. Citizens of the United States should be allowed to a direct vote because in 2000, 60 percent of voters voted that they prefer a direct election, and because the voters are not voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors.

To begin, according to source 2, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" This quote from Source 2 is explaining what your vote couts for when you go to elect for a president. Those electors are anyoen who doesn not own a public office. Who elects the electors is the state.

In addition, this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet, the electoral college still has its defenders, states in source 2.

Large bulleton board's towlering above the city streets and towns a smiling face firmly drawn on them with the caption, ""Vote for me for President."" Television's fills with compains and speeches.  How is it we come to the conclusion of voting a president? and which way do I favor? Among our rapidly growing population and country every 4 year's ""we the people "" cast in our vote for president and who might I ask count those votes? The electoral college, which some think it's a place but acually it's a long process to chosing our next president. The electoral college consists of electors, there meeting is where they voe for he president and also vice president by counting the electoral votes by congress. When you vote for president you are really choosing your candidate and actually voting for your candidate's electors. I strongly disagree with this mythed because I favor more that the president chose be chosen by popular vote  not by electors we chose.

What's wrong with the electoral colledge? You run into multiple issues with the electoral college as you slowly go into it's process and how the president is chosen. One big issuse is the Disaster factor. Considering that state legislatures are technially responsiable for picking electors. If we chose the president by popular vote like we should, it would be more resonable because it's a way so that the people of our country are happy. The eclectoral college is unfair to voter's also.  With the ""Winner takes all"", system is each state candidates don't even spend time in states they know have no chance is winning, there only focus is on the swing states and the ones who have a more lickly chance of winner with there voter! This is highly unfair to the people! Our votes should count more then what electors chose. This is our nation, our country, our home and we should get to decide on who will lead it in a fair way, electors should count all the votes and then chose  the president by popularity and better man.

The elector collegde is said to be a non-democratic method to be overruled by declaring the most popular votes for the candiate the winner. When your voting you acually voting for the slate of electors who will chose the president and vice president.

Chosing our president should be up to popular vote, electing electors who will chose the president is a unfair priocess and the electoral college is very out dated and it's system and ways should be over thought about. Counting our votes on president and chosing the president by popluar vote is the best way to go. Firstly it allows for the president most wanted to become president. Second it's a easier process then having to vote for a elector, wait for there votes, and then wait for there decesion on president. Think about it? We the people, should chose our president souly on poplation votes.

To conclude, the electoral college is a unfair, outdated, and irrational way to chose our presendent. We the people should be able to chose the present by poplar vote not only because it's our chose on who should lead are country but also it's a easier and better way to chose our president. I highly agree that we should be able to chose our next president by poplar vote and rething the electoral college.                       ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
2689E413844D,"To the senator of florida,

I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. The system is unjust and prevents we, the people to have our individual voices heard. When americans vote they're supposebly voting for the next president, when indeed they're votes only sway the opinion of the elector.

Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.

Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president (according to source 3), there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. This occured in the 1960's with hawaii and louisiana, and when vice president nixon validated only his opponents electors, he made sure to do so without ""establishing a president"", though it can happen again.

We should all agree with Nixon, carter, and dole on the fact that this system isn't fair. Our voices as individuals aren't heard, and we just vote for the state of electors. We, the people of the united states of America wish to do away with the electoral college.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

why does a state person can pick are next president. when the people cant choose and the state vote are more powerful then the people. the people can choose the president.

for example Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percsnt purality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the Electoral college (301 out 370). These is a reason why people right need to count more the the state.

3A9F1E5CEF61,"Dear State Senator,

We all know that the presidental election process is very important to our nation.  Many believe that using Electoral College is not a democratic pedigree, and that using the popular vote method is better.  I believe that we you keep the Electoral College in electing our nation's president.  There's a less likely chance that there will be a dispute, and we'll avoid run-off elections, with Electoral College.  During a presidental election, it is possible to have a dispute over who should be our next president.  The Electoral College helps reduce that issue.

In addition, the Electoral College voting method is better than voting by popular vote.  With Electoral College, we're less likely to have a dispute.  A lot think that a dispute over an Electoral College could not happen.  According to ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", a dispute is possible.  A dispute happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College rarely exceeds his share of the popular vote.  The third source gave an example of the Obama and Romney election.  Obama recieved 61.7 percent and Romney recieved 51.3 percent of the electoral vote.  Making a certain outcome of the election, and not resulting in a dispute.  Also, with Electoral College we avoid a run-off election.

To continue, the electoral college avoids a ruin-off election.  It avoids the problem where no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  The third source stated above, gave an example using the Nixon and Clinton election.  They both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.  When no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, it complicates the presidental election.  The Electoral College reduces any complication involving that.

Although the Electoral College is the method in which we select our president, it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.  Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California, have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign, knowing their vote would have no effect.  But, no voter's vote swings a national election.  Which means about one-half of the Americans eligible to vote, did not.  People that vote are people who want to express their political preference, rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  The Electoral College method is the choice to pick.

I believe that the Electoral College is the method we should continue using when electing our nation's president.  We're less likely to have a dispute, and we would avoid a run-off election, with the Electoral College.  This method has been working and should continue to work for our nation.

I'm in favor of the Electroral college because ""the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense"". There are five reason's im in favor of the electrocal college, One reason is the certainty of the outcome you wont win if you have more popular votes but less electoral vote ""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"".

The second reason is Everyone's President ""The electroral College  requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.""

In the 2012 elections Romney was popular in the south ""no incentive to campaign heavily in those states."" He doesnt have to have to campaign that much in the south because he knows those states will vote for him. The third reason is the Swing States ""The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012-to focustheir campaing efforts on the toss-up state."" Voters in the toss-up states have to pay close attention to the campaign because they're the ones that are going to decide the election . The forth reason is Big states, the bigger the states the more electoral votes they have and the presidential candidates pay more attention to those states ""a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in campaign than a small state does...""

The fifth Reason is Avoid Run-Off Elections ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the preisdential election process, reduced by the electoral college, which invariably produces a clear winner..."" that was my last reason i hope it stays the same to elect presidents.

The Electoral College has 538 electors, and majority of 270 electoral votes that is required to elect the presedent. Also, under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the distric of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for this reason, the word ""state"" also refers to district of columbia.

Plus, the presidential election is held every 4 years on a Tuesday after the first Monday of in November, and when you choose your states electors when you vote for president, you also are actually voting for your candidates electors. After the presidential election, the governor of your state prepares a listing of all the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors called, ""Certificate of Ascertainment"".

Your state also sends a Certificates of ascertainment to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of thee presidential election. The Electoral College is also a widely regarded as an anachronoism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the candidates who recieved the most popular votes the winner.

This positions are correct in arguing that the Electroal College method is not democratic in modern sense, but it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When people vote for the president they are actually voting for a state of electors.

Next, There are problems with the electoral college system voters vote not for a slate of electors, who inturn electthe president. Imagine if we had electoral votes it would be much easier and fair for all the people, than just rather have senate or House of Representatives have to pick, or Congress. At the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters.

Then, Some of the problems that we have, Because of the winner take all syste, in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning and that's a big problem focusing only on the tight races inthe ""swing"" states. It is informing us that During the 2000 there was a campaign that seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all,including states Rhode Island and South Carolina. and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voter, they have yetto make it.

Last, It almost obvious the electoral college is unfair, outdatedand irrational. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this butBob Dole was right he said to Abolish the electoral college. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. In 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election then, In 1976,  a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe

In conclusion, we voters have to stand up for our rights achieve our goal making this a better country and society to live in. Electoral votes should be made it is a much easier system. Changing the election by popular votes for the presidents for the United States is fair right? It is fair because it makes our country muche easier and better place to live.

81E6FDB0A4BB,"What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? The electoral college should be diminished because it is an unfair direct election, and the disaster factor.

To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system because as noted by Richard A. Posner, ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.""  By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections.  What we dont know is if it will permanantly work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk? The electors are the ones voting for the president, so we should question whether they should have control to help avoid these run-off elections.  The writer notes, ""... the pressure would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by electoral college..."" (Posner).  Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and olne benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college.

Moreover, the disaster facor has a huge impact on the electoral collage.  The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"" (Plumer).  This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.  According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.  The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plumer).  This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.  The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.

Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.  As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors."" (Office of the Federal Register).  This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.  That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer).  Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.  The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer).  This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.  Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?

All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.  Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?  By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard- working government we know it can be!

Electoral College is defined as a process. The Electoral college was founded by the founding fathers with the Constitution as an agreement between election of the president and by the popular vote of qulaified citizens. imsure you already know all of this , therefore i am here to inform you why Electoral College shouldnt be kept and popular vote should win. This is the citizens country so why should we have a leader that we dont even like? We all have the right of speech and of speeking for what we believe in. Last but not least why would the Electoral College get to choose our choice for us?

The United Sates is an independant country , therefore we should have the majority of the say in who we want to lead our country. say you're at a restraunt and they ask what you want on your hamburger your not just going to tell them to put what ever they want on it because then you wont like it, same situation just not with food. why would you want to live in a world with a leader you dont like, making choices you dont like eighter, everyone obviously wounldnt get their first choice because there has to be a winner and a loser. even if you lose thats better to say that you got a chance to say what you wanted it just didnt follow through.

We also all have the right of speech in the United States. What i mean by this is, we were all given a mouth by God for a reason. ""A closed mouth wont get fed"" so how would a closed mouth country get the correct leader they wanted? exactly they couldnt thats my point. if we speek were going to get a chance of getting more thought of when the decision is made, so if we were to all speek up the decision would be in our favor.

We all have a choice for diffrent things, some people like peanut butter, some people dont like peanut butter, some people are alergic to peanut butter. so say you hate peanut butter and you told the waitress your order and she said no youre getting a peanut butter sandwhich, you, hatin peanut butter, obviosuly wouldnt like that at all. Same sitauation here. Why would they let you say your choice in what you want then just tell you what youre going to get? its just not right and dsent add up.

Therefore i am a firm believer that it should be popular vote not by electoral college, and if you dont beliee that well you are making the wrong choice and letting other people make the choice up and speek for you.

We should keep the Electoral College because thats what we've used since the beginning of our nation. Many people dont relise it but it does help us a lot when we have to decide who we want for president. My few reasons on why we should keep the Electoral College are, what happens with your vote, why we use the Electoral College.

Firstly, when you cast your vote it goes directly to an office to be counted and store for later. The Electors who cast the Real vote for the state look over the balets and decide who to vote for their state. Billions of people cast their votes but really only 270 count and those are the representatives for the states. You many think your vote doesn't count but in reality it does to the Electors of your state. We need to keep the Electoral College for our voters and to keep our tradition.

Secondly, we use the Electoral College to guid our electors on who the people want to lead our country and to help lead our country. Many people don't vote cause the lines are too long or they claim they don't have time but we really know that they don't care. Everyone should care cause we need everyone to vote and help the state electors choose who we want for president or who we want for other helpful positions.

My names is PROPER_NAME. I am 14 years old, born and raised in the beautiful city of LOCATION_NAME and I am writing to talk to you about the Electoral College. I've done my research, and according to the article

What Is the Electoral College?

by the Office of the Federal Register, it was first established ""in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What I understood from that text is that it was made to keep equality and fairness between the government and the people. If that is so, why is it that the people have no say in it? I believe that the election should be based on the popular vote because the people should get what the people want.

The Constitution says ""We the people, by the people, for the people,"" yet the people have limited power. I understand that in order to form a more perfect union of our nations, their must be laws and rules and people who govern, as well as enforce, these laws and rules. All I'm asking for is a bit more freedom and power as a citizen of these United States of America.

I'm not the only one who thinks this way. ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Their has been several cases in which the candidate has ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency"" (Plumer). For instance, the election in 2000 with Al Gore, where his opponent, George W. Bush, received 271 electoral votes and he received 266, eventhough Gore won the popular vote. Instead of voting for a group of people who vote for us, what's the harm in letting the people choose our nation's leader?

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, has a section titled

What's wrong with the electoral college in which he questions ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"", to which he replies, ""Not always."" If ""we the people"" are supposed to be the one's with the freedom, then we should have the freedom to at least choose who we're going to have as our President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" (Plumer). Take Mitt Romney, for example. He ran for president in 2012, and, knowing that campaigning down South, where he would already be receiving the votes, would not gain him any electoral votes, he didn't campain there at all. This is why they focus on the ""swing"" or ""toss-up"" states, and make the other states feel left out, like ""the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."" (Posner)

To prevent the states to feel left out and to prevent an injustice such as this one, we should end the anachronism that is the Electoral College. ""...The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all agreed on it at one point in time: ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" (Plumer).

As many of you guys know many people vote, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. They all say that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

B43C1055C489,"Dear,

Senator of florida is send you this letter to tell you why we need to keep things the way they are. Electoral college is a process in which we decide who will be our president of the United States of America. During this process the Electoral College consist of 538 electors in which 270 of those electoral votes is required to elect the President. During this presidential election you vote for you candidate but what your actually doing is voting for your candidate's electors. All though the electoral colleges have things wrong with it they do have have some positive things that counter the negative out. Like certainty of a outcome,avoiding run-off election,you have to have trans-regional appeal(everyone's President),Swing states, and Big states.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 200-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. Winning candidate's share the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney.... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner- take-all basis. A nationwide electoral vote is possible because 538 is a even number, but its  highly unlikely. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election to focus more on toss-up states. As the people of these states are very thoughtful in deciding who they will pick because they are the people that pay close attention to the campaing.

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchonism. People believe that it should be changed to who ever gets the most popular votes. People only believe it should be changed because of what has happened in the past with other elections. Like what happened in 200,1960 segregationists in the legislature nearly succeded in replacing the demacratic electors, and the worst being that it ends up in a tie. Things have happened in the past.

We dont need to change because of things that happened in 2000 or 1960. Its 2015 and we dont need a change to our way of deciding the president. Theres no reasonto changing it to popular vote.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
B4D70523689C,"Keeping the Electoral College is not smart for the united states voting system. First, many citizens all over the country don't agree with the voting system. Second, the Electoral College may be swayed by bias. Third, citizens do not really have control over their vote. The Electoral College system should be changed.

Many American citizens do not agree with the voting system. Citizens have grievances about the system being unfair and unreasonable. The Office of the Federal Register states, ""It's official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" (source 1). If American citizens are persistant with the issue, and continue to argue, then why is the government keeping the system? Why doesn't the government come up with a more rational voting system?

The Electoral College's vote may be swayed by bias. How can we trust total strangers with our vote? Bradford Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states (source 2). Voters do not get the full effect of voting because they are voting for other ""qualified"" people to vote for them. How is that possibly effective?

Citizens do not have control over their vote. Once citizens vote their vote is out of their hands. The Electoral College chooses the president for them and there is nothing citizens can do about it. Bradford Plumer states, ""Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election"" (source 2). The government has full control over how the election goes, not the citizens who voted.

The entire Electoral College system is completely irrational. The government needs to come up with a new way to vote for future presidents that is more fair. If we find a solution to this problem the government will not only gain favor of the American citizens, but also keep the balance that is established by the constitution. The American citizens will have control over their vote. The Electoral College should be abolished.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
C5F0A4F3B583,"Dear State Senator,

I think we should get rid of the Electorial college because they are unfair. There are only a few reasons to why we need the Electorial college. I think we should get rid the college because it is a non- democratic method of selecting our president. It shoule be overruled by declaring the candidate who got the most popular votes. Its the electors who select the president not the people. When you vote, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

Another reason why would get rid of the Electorial college is because of the winner takes all system. Canadiates dont spend time in the states they know have no chance of winning. They only focused on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 capaign, seveteen states did not see the the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not see a single campaign.

It can be argued that the Electorial College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, demo crates in texas, or reblicans in California for example. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incntive to pay attention to the campign thean they would have if the president were picked by popular vote... The voters in presidential elections are people who to want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

Whats wrong the Electorial College?

When we are under the Electorial College system , voters vot not for the president, but they vote for slate of electors. For example if you lived in texas and wanted to vote for [John] kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off chance  that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electorial votes. These electors could be anyone not holding public office. Plus voters can not control who the electors vote for. Voters end up getting confused because of the candidates the electors vote for.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

In my opinion i think that the election should be by popular vote by the American citizens. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair to voters and irrational.

The first reason why the electoral college is absurd is because it is not fair. It has a winner- take- all system in each state. Candidates dont spend time in states that have no chance of winning. Into that, the article ""

The Indefensible Electoral college

State legislatures are currently resposible for choosing the electors

"". So technically they give us a category of presidents to choose from!

The last the second and final reason is it is irrational. Although the founding fathers of the countries establlished the electoral college, that doesn't mean its still valid. There have been many mistakes and disasters in the previous years. In the same article it says ""over sixty percent of the vote would prefer a direct election over the one we have now"". This proves that im not the only one who dissagrees on the electoral college.

It makes sense why people will actually like the electoral college. Considering that it is an easier way for us to vote and takes less time.

This system did work in the 17th to about the late 19th centrrey but now now in this day and age the old system is like the gamecube , it had a good run and serived it's purpose but now its time to move on to better and more up to date system . Now thats out of the way lets see what should the new system could possably be .

First up , by the people of the U.S.A. . What I mean by that is the poplare vote . With this system everyone's vote matter . Lets say that to win the vote you have to have ten thusand ore votes than your oppint or something like that . I really don't know the best way to do the voting system but this could should be solved by the gonverment and not the high school student that is writing this . Other than that lets move on .

Next one up , Repesitives . I know there is something like this but do this base on population . Like for every 10,000 there is one repesitive or something like that . This could be a cleaner and faster system than the one in the first paragraph . Both of the system mainly focus on the people so you can't do wrong with ether of this systems . Thatsall I have to say about this system .

Now the moment you been waiting for , update the old system . Sometimes all you have to do is update the old system . The system is out datted but if you update it you could make it better . It may or may not work work but you do this right this system could last the U.S.A. a nother 300 years .

In conclusion , this is what you could do to replace the system . There are many more but to me this are the three best systems I can think of so I hope you agree with me . Other than that I wish you farlwell .    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1EC5C39D73B1,"Dear state senator,

Election day is held every four years on the frist Tuesday in the month of November. When you elect for president would you perfer voting yourself and having your vote count or voting for someone who will then vote for your state and elect for the president of choice. For example, lets use the election of Obama versus MittRomeny. Imagnie if you voted for a man who said ""If you vote for me to repersent your state I will elect Obama!"" He might be tricking you and vote for MittRomeny when it is time for them to vote. That means your vote for them and that promise he made to your state dosn't matter because he wanted to voted for MittRomney and he knew majority of the state would go for Obama.

I believe that the Electoral College is wrong for the simple fact is that you do not know the intentions of the reperesentors. For example, in article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states in section ""What's wrong with the electoral college"" that ""Back in 1960, segregations in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic eletors with new electros who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kenndey.) In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.... Oh, and what state sends two electors to Congress? It happenend in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Senate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so 'without establishing a precedent'"" This ststement shows that whoever is running can overthrow the other by chaning the mind of their electors.

Also it state in the the same article and same section that ""ATt the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning, focuding only  on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventenn states didn't see the candidiates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didin't get to see a single campaign ad."" That means the states who did not get to see campaign ads blindly vote for an elector who will then blindly vote for a president.

I believe that popular voting will be a lot better because so that everyone can vote and not just one person picking for an entier state. Also in popular voting campagin ads will be seen in every state and everybody can make their own choices so noone is blindly voting. At the end after each state is done voting, all the votes will be added together, and a president will be chosen by majoirty rules. So state senator, what is your choice?

B2F69B97BC2A,"Dear state senator,

I think that every person who wants to go for president should go to electoral school, just so when ever the person runs for president they don't win because they are well known and popular vs the other person who is not well known. Also if they do go to election school they could learn how to run for pesident and learn how to write speeches, and also teach them that some of the 50 states in the united states have to have his/her vote.

The out come of a person running for president that went to electoral school their electoral vote will be above average for one year and if they do good as president then the outcome for next year will maybe bet higher or lower.

D34054ADD2FB,"The Electoral College is a system which was established to elect the president of the United States of America. In this system, each state receives a group of electors. The number of electors each state is awarded is based on the representation a state has in Congress. The total number of electors per state equals the number of people a state has in the House of Representative plus the two senators a state has. In a state, the electors pledge to vote for the candidate who wins the popular vote. This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished.

To commence, the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable. The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. With so much unreliability, why is the outdated system of the Electoral College still in use?

Furthermore, the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21). While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election. Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election. This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced.

In retrospect, the Electoral College must be abolished. It is an inherently unfair system and it does not reflect the views of American voters.                              ",6,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
B1B0D8237ED0,"Dear Senate,

It is only fair to the people of America to change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. The process of the Electoral vote seems to leave out votes and make them seem less improtant, and that right there is discriminating the peoples right. Millions of people in each state vote for a president but then out of all those votes only 34 electoral votes would consist, and that's if your electors win the statewide election. If not then your canidate already loses votes from your whole state.

Although, they're are some reasons for retaining the Electoral College. A canidate would need trans-reginal appeal not just the appeal of one region. Or found in ""In the Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presdident""  Posner states ""The Electoral college restores some of the weight of the politicial balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"". Last, pressure from run-off elections when a candidate doesn't win majority vote is subsided by the Electoral College.

However, the College Electoral process has more cons then pros.  With the electoral college system voters vote for the slate of electors not president. Millions of votes casted in each state are practically forgotten about after one of the electors win the statewide election. How is it that millions of votes only count as 34 electoral votes? Peoples opinons do matter and each one of them need to be heard. The winner-take-all system is just not fair to voters and needs to change.

Furthermore, the elector college sytem is shady and sketchy.

2EA7BBA9340E,"While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obselete way of electing the President. It is, essentially, an indirect way for voters to choose their candidates, by voting for electors whose loyalty is not guaranteed. The Electoral College vote can override the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 Presidential Election. Some say that the Electoral College is a system worth keeping, because it provides a certain outcome and avoids run-off elections, yet these arguments are founded on little reason.

Undoubtedly outdated, this system is a catastrophe in the works, the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy (11). Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occassionally, it is yet another fault in this system.

Not only is the Electoral College irrational, it is also simply unfair. Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters (12). Other sources say a tie would be unlikely. However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way (12). Because of the ""winner-take-all"" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or unfavor them (13).

It is simple, the Electoral College system is a turn-off for many voters, especially after the incident in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. Voters can be discouraged if they have no hope of carrying their state, like Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in Cali (23). Assuming that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election (23)"" is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. Relying on the popular vote may make a tie more likely, but it would free voters from an obselete and untrustworthy system. Over 60 percent of voters oppose the Electoral College (9) which is enough to bring attention to these facts and, hopefully, address them before another controversial occurance.

The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and near-mishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters. The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.                                                               ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College is a crucial part of the United States's election process. There are some negatives to the Electoral College but the positives outweigh them by a landslide. The certainty of the outcome and having a president that the majority likes are key beneficial factors to the Electoral College process that would be lost if we changed the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

With the Electoral College, there is a very rare chance that there would be a tie in the nationwide electoral vote. However, according to

A clear winner will always be produced with the slight innormality of a tie. In 2012's election, Barack Obama received 51.3% of the popular vote compared to the 61.7% of the electoral vote. If the election process was by popular vote, it would have been a much closer race between Obama and Romney.

To win the Electoral College vote, each region must like you. You cannot have a presidential candidate that favors one region and only one region favors that candidate.

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner states, ""...a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" In contrast,

F309843EDF56,"Dear senator of florida state,

I believe the united states should get rid off the electorial college as we all know the electorial college consists of 538 slectors in which a majority of 270 electorial votes are required to elect the president. In response to this the citizens of the U.S.A are technically not voting for the president but voting for the group of electors chosen by the candidate's political party in which as stated in source 1

""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.""

As stated in source 2 voters cannot always control who they are voting for and voters often get confused about the electors and voting for the wrong candidate.

The evidence to support this claim is the 2000 fiasco which was the biggest election crisis of the century. State legislatures are responsible for picking electors and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Evidence form source 2 goes back to 1960 when segregationists in the louisiana legistlature almost succeded in replacing democratic electors with new electors that did not support and oppose John F. Kennedy thus proving that the electorial college cannot be trusted. Another reason why the electorial college is unfair to the people is because of the winner-takes-all system in each state due to the candidates not being in the state and focus only on the race between ""swing"" states. Evidence from the 2000 campaign states seventeen states didn't see candidates at all.

Most worrying would be the prospect of the tie in the electoral vote by any means in that type of case the election would be assigned for the House of Representatives where state delegations vote on the president because each state cast only one vote.

An example of this would be the representative from wyoming representing 500,000 voters would have more to say including the representative from california who represents 35 million voters. Those voters vote for one party for president and one for congress, the decision of the house can barely be reflected on the will of the people. supporting this is the election in 1968 in which a shift of 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election another election in 1976 a tie would occur if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.

Though the electoral college is an anachronism it is not democratic in a modern sense because the electors are the ones who choose the president not us the people though each party has to select of slate of electors who are intrusted to vote for the party's nominee. Although the electoral college method despites its lack of democrastic pedigree is still used today its because of its certainty of outcome the reason is because the winning candidate's share of the electoral college exceeds his share of the popular vote, and also avoids run off elections to happen. Another reason why the electoral college method is still used today is as stated in source 3 because it restores weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal- appointment of the senate decreed in the constitution. The electoral colege requires a president candidate to have trans-regional appeal no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.

Even thogh these reasons oppose my claim as stated in source 2 the electoral college is unfair, oudated and irrational.

An example of this was in 2012 when obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electorial vote against 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney

Basically what the electoral college method is a method where only the electoral vote is more importnant than the popular vote or the peoples vote.

In which It supports my claim when I said the people are not voting for the president but for the group of electors who support the candidate. In the example of 2012 obama vs romney obama won because of the percentage of the electorial vote which means that a candidate that is running for president can win the election if the electoral vote surpasses the popular vote.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The problem is there are states with 3 and there are states with 20 it seems unfair to some states because they may be small compaired to some states but isn't fair if we just abolish the electoral colledge. it gives the people what they want and it puts the right president in charge.

Its a great idea to abolish the electoral colledge it makes the people happy and if we make a wrong choice its are fault we can deal with it we've been through way worse.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
FC44783E32EE,"I personally think that for once in a lifetime America and when I say America I mean the people of our nation should be able to elect presidents of the United States by popular votes. I know some of you is questioning yourselves why would i say something like that and that reason is because I know there's people arguing here in our society about their beliefs in why one person should become president and another arguing why one should become president. In the passage it reads under the 23rd ammendment of the constitution the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral Ccllege. But if you ask me me I'll be saying and asking you or in other words the congress why do you guys have to go through all of this just to get to a president election  and have a president of the United States .It's just some things the world have gone though are totally dramatic and this is the very first thing a person's going to say ""the world's a very corrupt place nowadays""but in my eyes i say that the world can become a better place if the people cooperate togather and stop trying to always slice eachother's throats about a stupid reasoning over a dumb presidential election that the house of representatives have put togather and now they want to act as if they had no par-take in the action going on. So I think the people on our own should be able to vote fo rour own president and not have congress put in there who they think is fit for the position of being president. I state this because the one who always look peaches and cream aint always sugar they say things in the campaigns to get us americans on either sides but when we vote for that one who said he going to stop this and that and then when he get in the chair of being president,they don't do nothing at all. So i say let America vote for it's own presidency and not the people.    ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D0B46299D094,"This goes out to the senator of florida. I think we need to chang to voteing way. We need to change it from the Electoral college to the most popular vote for the president of th Unitd States of America. Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot.

Now that I've read it we don't even vote for the prsident we vote for the slate of electorswho in turn elect the president. Whom are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depnds on the state sometimes state conventions sometimes the stateparty's centeral committee sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for ? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? Sometimes.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. And dont likethat because the what the heck is happening if were not acktually voting for the president and just the electors. Like for real then whats the point of voting if were not getting what we want. When the goverment is all about giveing the people what they want. Like why can't they just let the people vote for the people the want to vote for like for real. This sucks that we can't get wht we deserve.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
