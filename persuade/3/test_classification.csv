8DAECD812067,"Many people are in belief of evaporating the idea of having the Electoral college. A Gallop poll taken in 2000 shows that citizens would rather have a direct election. As a member of the United States you must think of all the posibilites. Yes, the electoral college was once a great process, but now there are some changes are in need of being made.

The electoral college is a process in which we select electors. This long and dragged out procedure is many steps that take months to prepare for. First, there must be a selection of the electors which are chosen by the states. Then the meeting must be planed and taken place. Who and why is a hard aspect to decide on voting day for those who have been chosen to be the electors. Votes for president and Vice President must be made. After voting the counting beings. The Electoral College has a total of 538 members. Over 270 votes must be made to elect the President. This process can easily be shortend by using a direct election.

By having a direct election everyone's voice is heard. This means less arguing in the states. Citizens enjoying believing their thoughts are not being avoided. Having the Electoral College taking place is highly unwanted in the US. This is because the people believe a direct vote is more efficient way for them to show who they believe is worthy of being President and Vice President.

Each candidate running for office retains a group of electors from a state. These electors are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. This means if a person doesnt like the electors chosen they feel like they still dont have a say of what is going on in the presidential election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College is no longer a process citizens enjoy. This procedure is too long and citizens dont encourage it. Many people believe that this branch of government feels they will lose more power if the Electoral College is given up on. Using a direct election will spare the arguments and will allow us to have an easy and manageable process in which to vote on our leading man.                          ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
63B0C1CE1743,"Dear, state senator we should keep the Electoral College because its better and its unique. Its better because the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for Presdident and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.

The Electoral College is really a progress. Its also better because you can help choose your your state's electors when you vote for President becuse when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. They are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Its better in alot of ways.

The Electoral College is unique in many ways. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a Compromise between election of the President by a vote for President and Vice Preident, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the preident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.                   ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
8071DCB0328D,"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is an anachronism. It belongs in the past and should not decide who are president is going to be anymore because its not who the majority of people really want to be leading,it could cause a tie,and its unfair to voters.

Abolishing the electoral college has been a thing people have wanted gone for some time. Because of the electoral college the popular vote has not effected who becomes president. According to the article,(The Indivisible Electoral College),over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tha the one we have now. this means many people would rather switch out the electoral college with a direct vote. With the electoral college still up voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could lose again.

Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in an election. According to the article,(The Indivisible Electoral College),if the election was a tie it will be thrown to the House of Representatives,where state delegations vote on the president.This mean that people would still have no say in the matter of choosing a president.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnner take system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. According to the article,during the 2000 campaign,seventeen states didnt see canidates at all. This means voters didnt even have a chance to vote.

The electoral college should be ruled out in the future because its not who people really want to lead,it could result in a tie, andits unfair to voters. If its removed then there would be better leaders in the future.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E3A689BDA786,"Dear State Senator,being apart of the voting process is extremely important.It's important,because you are helping by popular vote for the president of the United States.Electoral College helps you get a better understanding of the voting process and the effect that everyone's vote has.However,the Electoral colleges are not a really big help when it comes down to the country.Here is provided information about why they should change election by popular vote.

First to start the discussion,Electoral Colleges were estblished by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote.The Electoral College is not just a place it's an important process.This college is made of electors.They have meetings where they vote for the president and vice president.The college is consisted of 538 electors.At least 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president.Each candidate that is interested in becoming president in your state has to have his or her own flock of electores.The electors are chosen by the political party ran by the candidate.This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many.

Next,The Electoral college system only allows voters to vote for the slate electors. The president of the United States votes is more important then the slate electors.The president of the United States is the one responsible for the Country.Most people refer to the most common argument between the electoral college as the disater factor.Like for instance if someone wanted to vote for a specific person you would have to vote for a different amount of slate electors also depending where you lived as well.

Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. Many people believe that,that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves more popular votes is the winner.Each party selects a slates of electors that is trusted to vote for the nominee that was picked slate electors.Even though the Electoral has a lack of conservative reasons, there are five reasons that people think that should be retained. The first reason is the certainy of outcome,second Everyone's President,third Swing states,fourth Big States,and lastly Avoiding run-off Elections.These 5 things are reasons why people feel that these colleges should stay.

The conclusion, the president of the United states is chosen by our votes.We have the power to make this country strong,but we also have the power to make this country a train wreck.Voting is really important this can determine the fate of the country.

Sincerly,PROPER_NAME                                                                                                                   ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
ED8EE1F02203,"A electors  college is a process , not a place. The electoral college was established it is the constitution as a conpromise betweet election of the presendent by a vote in congress and electection of the presendent by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The election college it like what person you want to br the presendent , maybe you dont vote for that person maybe someone will vote for them. youcan votefor anyboby only if you think that person is good for the comminuty.

I think the vic presedent is like to help out with work or it the presendent retired maybe the vic presendent will take out now the vic presendent will be the new presendent. In the story it say that each member that vote in the house of representative plus two fie you senators. You help choose your state electors when you vote for presendent because when you vote for your condidute you are actully voting for your condidate's electors. the certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presendent candidate in your statae and shows which electors will represent you r state at the meeting.

In the story they ask you what is wrong with the electors college. I think the problem is that one the off-change that those electors be anyone not holding public office. The single best argument agaisnst the electorsal college is what they might call the disaster factor. they the people in american should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. is the most worrying  the prospect of s tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrwn to the house of representatives, where state delegation vote on the presendent. And the thing is that the senate would choose the vice-presendent. because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 votes would have sa much say as the 55 representative from carofornia, who represent 35 million votes.

9BE6A3CF1E3C,"The electoral college should not be used and the popular vote for the president should be in active

To begin with,the 'electoral college' is not fair. The people should vote for who they want and most popular vote wins.'under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president ,but for the slate of electorals, who turn elect for president' (paragraph 10 'whats wrong with the electoral college,)Citizens of america should vote for the their new leader. The slate should not then decide the election of the president.

To countine with, many problems can be caused with the electoral college.'the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisisin a century;the system allows for much worst .Considering that the state  legistarter are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.' (paragraph 11 'whats wrong with the eclectoral college.')the system had caused a big diaster in voting history do to the electoral vote. with the electoral vote people have then no choice but to blame the state considering that their the ones who are responsible for the voting.

To continue with another reason why it should not be used is because depending how big the state is (population) thats how many elecctoral votes they get. 'obama ,who won the vote,got 29 electoral votes' (paragraph 21 'big states') 'if you lived in texas, for instance, and you wanted to vote for for john kerry . on the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election,they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral vote' (paragraph 10 'whats wrong with electoral college') people should have all equal votes its not fair for rhode island to get less electoral votes then florida because its size. if the state of rhode island people vote for either party there vote should count as much as florida.

in conclusion the electoral college should not be in use and the popular vote for the president should be in active. because every citizin should have the right to vote for who they want to be their president.                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
72E8EFB1A713,"There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. There are many reasons why we should switch to popular vote but there are three that are most important. The canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, it would be less likely to get a tie, and the canidate would have to campain in every state because there wouldn't be a winner-takes-all situation.

Most importantly the canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote. The reprsentative electors have the final say in who is elected because they are the ones that put in the votes. An example of this is Al Gore back in 2000. According to some polls Al Gore lost the election thanks to the electoral college because he won the popular vote but still lost the election. Al Gore had recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush but still lost. Geoerge W. Bush had 271 electoral votes to Al Gore's 266. However, this is not the last time this will happen and voters can expect to see it happen again in the future were the popular vote winner loses the presidency.

Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives. In the event of a tie meaning that each canidate got an equal number of votes from the electors the House of Representatives would have the oppurtunity to vote for the president. This is not a fair system in any way because that would mean the representative for Wyoming who is only representing 500,000 thousand people would have as much say as a representative from California who is there representing 35 million voters! There has been many close incidents of a tie so it is possible for this to happen. In 1968 a shift of 41,971 votes would have put the election in a tie. In 1976, id 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii would have voted the other way then the race for presidency would have gone into the hands of the House.

Furthermore the canidates would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be winner-takes-all which means the winner of the electoral votes gets all the votes within that state even if some of the residents did not vote for that party. The canidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the ""swing"" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.

In conclusion the President of the United States should be elected by popular vote because a canidate would not have to worry about winning the popular vote but losing the election, the possibility of a tie would decrease, and the canidate would havw to campaign in every state. These are just a few of the many reasons that we should switch over to a popular vote system, plus who wouldnt wan't to have a little more say in who runs our magnificent country.

BFAA8D19FFA9,""" The Electoral College is a process, not a place."" retorted by the Office of the Federal Register. The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers. The main reason it was established was because it was a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College is a timely and outdated process that consists of selecting the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Yes, the Electoral College has helped the United States of America but it has also caused us many major conflicts that no citizen can change. Many Americans are not heard and by demolishing the Electoral College and bringing our ""old friend"" popular vote back in majority of Americans will be heard. This is a free country right? Do we have the right to be heard and vote for ourselves? I strongly believe we do. I vehemetly feel that the United States of America should use popular vote due to the fact Electors can turn sides, in reality voters are not even voting for the President they're voting for the electors, and there is often a major conflict also known as the ""disaster factor"".

""...electors could always defy the will of the people."" Stated by author, Bradford Plumer.  Once Electors are voted for they have our trust and votes in the center of their palms. They could either listen to the people or break our trust. Majority of times more than 15% of electors turn sides and vote for the opposing party. In a survey taken in 2000 more than 60% voted for popular vote by citizens because they were unwilling to put they're vote in the electors hands. Looking at the correct statistics don't you believe it's only fair to the American people that we use popular vote? More than half of America believes it is only right to use popular vote. What about the other half? Well, thinking about the situation, in the end, they will still get what they want and what is needed. But the real question here is, what do you think?

Lets take a quick look at reality here! When voting for the President of the United States of America you are technically voting for electoral votes. Majority of America does not realize that because of the Electoral College you are voting for their votes. As an citizen of the United States we have the freedom to speak and vote for whoever we want. When voting we are basically putting our votes in the hands of the electors so if sides are turned doesn't that basically mean our freedoms/rights are being violated? I advocatly believe it does and the only way we could possibly fix it is by establising popular vote. So why are we waisting time?

Last but never least, popular vote should be established because almost every four years the Electoral college runs into major problems whether sides being turned on or just the system running low. Believe it or not voting is not supposed to be such a chaotic process. Assertions are made with not much basis which causes majority of the problems we face. If we get rid of the Electoral college entirely all the conflicts will vanish. Our founding father would be proud to know that we got rid of the system that was giving America major  problems even if we much appriciate our founding fathers.

In conclusion, I vehemetly feel that the United states of America should use popular vote due to the fact Electors can turn sides, in reality voters are not even voting for the president they are voting for the electors, and there is often a major conflict also known as "" disaster factors"".

88999FCDE08A,"The Electoral college process,is most certainly not a place,Yet it consist of a selection of electors. Throughout time,this process of voting has only failed to work like it should 2 times,Once in 1888,andOnce in 2000. electoral voting is like a process that rules out the popular vote. The electors are the people that make the final decision,Dispite however the popular vote takes place and whoever gets the most majoraty of the votes,The Electoral vote is the most impotant voting process.

The United States Of America states in one very important document,that ""We the people"",as all the people in one,""in order to form a more perfect union""what does those words mean? Well those words mean that not just Electors should have the say in who is voted president,But everyone should have a say as in who is president in the world that everyone lives in,the popular vote is the best voting process,The origional voting process and that sthe way the voting process should stay that way.

Richard A. Posner states that ""it is the electors who elect the president,not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"". that tells you that your not actually voting for the president,that you're voting for electors that vote for the president,They try so hard to trick us,knowing most people are to lazy to stand up and fight for what is right,that they just ru n over us,as in the people. the ""Winner- takes all""Method is actually awardoing the electoral votes,induces the candidates.

Bradford plumer stated that even Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole and the U.S Chamber of Commerce,have all agreed that the Electoral college should be abolished!.

'We the people"" should have the right to vote for whoever we want becouse we are the people that pay for all of the elector's and the fact that we have to vote for who we take care of is just outragious. the people of the United States should stand up and fight for what is right and for what is fair,We cant just keep sitting back and letting the higher powered peopkle run over us,yes we respect the rules that we are supposed to follow and yes we do what we have to do to survive and live a free and healthy life,but this ""Electoral College""needs to come to a end and ""We the people"" should be able to vote with the popularity voting method.                                   ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
47D48093D896,"Voting falls down into 2 catagories; Electoral college and Popular vote. If it were up to the citizens to decide how to vote some may pick electoral, but others would pick popular. I would pick popular because it should be up to the citizens to decide on how we vote for our nations leader.

If I remember correctly, we the people should have the right to pick our nations president. When using the electoral college system you are voting for the slate of electors who will decide your ultimate vote for president. So really your not voting for the president. But popular vote is a different story. You get to decide who our president will be and your vote counts for something. People need a say on the president and voting the electoral college does not show how many people truly want someone as president. Also accordig to electoral vote smaller states dont get as much votes as they should.

On the otherhand electoral votes may have an upside. When you vote for president you can help choose states electors which some people would rather do. But each party picks a slate of electors to vote for theyre nominee; and those people are very much trusted. Also its possible the winner may win electoral votes but not popular vote. All the reasons to use electoral vote are because of the certainity of the outcome, swing states, big states, and because it avoids run-off elections.

Even though using the electoral vote may please some people I still believe that using popular vote would be the best thing for us. Many people before us tried to abolish electoral college and many still do. "" What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their lifetime, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" (9).

50CA4F9F983E,"changing the election to popular vote would I think benefit us and this country. Whats the point on voting for the president if the electoral college is going to do it and will pick the final decision. the electoral college cinsits of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president, but what about us who vote. I feel like there is no point in voting if the whole election is based off the electoral college. This electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that runs in each state. candidates dont spend there time in the states they have no chance in winning in, they only spend there time in the states they think they can win in. For example in 2000 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all! Some people in these 17 states didnt see one ad at all. Its not like us voters can control who there electors vote for because some voters get confused about the electors and sometimes can vote for the wrong candidate. Its not fair to us if we dont matter in this vote at all, especially when the people running dont send an ad out to every state and dont visit every state. The election is held every four years and we help choose our states elecotors when you vote for president because when we vote for the cadidate we actually vote for the candidates electors so it doesnt really make an impact on votes and i think that we should vote for the cadidates themselves  not there electors.

601BF2CC9EA1,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I would like to advice you that keeping the electoral collage is a good idea.

Based on all of the voting and advances it has progressed. It has done an easily better job for everyone. Demorcats,republicans and citizens advance this and make it a better world to live in. it restores some of the weigtht in the political balance that large states by population sources say. In other words electoral collages avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

For instance,citizens are what president canidates are more interested in because those are the most important people to be aware off. Especially since their the reason for your presidential election or career. It requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal.

When no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. it is now a best offer to have electoral collages. Reasons why people dont want electoral collages method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying thier states.

In addition, voters in presidential elections are peoplewho want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The electoral collage is a process,not a place. Its process consists of the selection of the electors,the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president. The counting of the electoral votes by congress. With that being it is not a decision that us citizens are choosen to do.

B02AD8EE0DF0,"I would keep it the same because it would put more work on the poll workers because they would have to count all the votes for each president. If they miss a few votes the wrong person could be elected as president. I would rather them keep it the same because its simple, faster to calculate, and easy to read.

I say its simple because you just have to count the votes and make an elctoral vote and then if u have the most electoral votes for that state it mean that you won the vote in that state. At the end it matters who has majority of the electoral votewhich is 270. It'sbasically the same as how much states you've won to see who will be elected as president.

I also think its faster to calculate because when you do electoral votes you would see how many electoral votes yu have out of 538. The majority of electoral votes is 270 so, If you have majority of the 538 votes you will be elected.

It's easier to read electoral votes because you are adding and subtracting only 538 people, but if you are counting from popular votes you would have to add up millions and billions of votes that would be miscounted. If it's miscounted the wrong person could be elected for president.            ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

3983417BC709,"The Electoral College has been a part of America since the beginning, but is it fair? Our country is a Democracy, which means "" For the People"" or "" By the People"". The Electoral College is not By the People. Yes, it has historcal value, but it no longer is what a Democracy is because of population changes and states being added to the country.

To begin with, Source 2 states "" The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state."" There is a popularity vote and then the Electoral College vote, most citizens think that the popularity vote will win because that candidate is the person that the people chose. That is not the case. It just depends on basically how big your state is and how popular a candidate is in that state. The population is the biggest factor that the candidates think about because if they win that state they are closer to winning the election. There are people who want to abolish the Electoral College including past presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. It really just isn't fair to the people that who they vote for and who wins the popular vote may not have a chance to win because he/she did not get the Electoral College votes.

In addition, Source 3 states "" The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who vote for a president, no the people."" When you vote in your state you are actually voting for an elector and not the presidential candidate. In 2000 the popular vote was higher for Al Gore than it was for George Bush, but Bush won the presidential election because he had a higher number of electors in the electoral college. In a real democracy Gore would have won because of the fact he was more popular. The people want to vote directly for the candidate they want not for some person that has been trusted to vote for a party's nominee.

Finally, The Electoral College is kind of fair in a way because it is based off population in each state. There is also an equal number of electors. Source 1 states "" The founding fathers established it (the electoral college) in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" I understand that it is a law set by the men who created our country and it worked back then. It just isn't working in present day.

In conclusion, The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers back when the U.S. was small and didn't have a huge population like we do today. It worked back then, but now there are 50 states and millions of people. They want to be heard. The popular vote would make more sense than having states with huge populations deciding the fate of the election, when it should by popularity of the candidate.

the single best arguement againt the electoral college is the disaster factor. faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their parties canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

perhaps maybe there was a tie in the electorial vote. this is considered the most worring of all. the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, this is unfair to voters.. because of the winner takes all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.

The eletoral collage has very many problems in its system. a few of them are that when the citizens vote they are not voting for the president they are voting for the elcetors who vote for the presidents. Another reason is Eletoral collage is very unfair. The peeople or the electors that are voting are not always the right ones also depending on which side you are on rpublican or the decmocratic sometimes een for example you are a republican one of your electors could be democratic as i said before very unfair.

Finally everyone gets tired of crummy old boring things! Have you ever hear it is good to try new things? lets face it the system is really old. I believe would shold try differant methods of selecting the president. If for any reason it does not work out we can always try something else or go back too the same way. i belive that we should try something new and not the same old boring unfair way we have been using for years.

All in all i belive  that we should change the way we vote for the president. This eletoral collage from my understaning is not something we should keep using. As i said there are to many reason that i would have to write down but here are my three reasons to change the way we vote. First the prosses of picking the president, second the problems that the eletoral college has, and last because the system is old and needs to change so, no that you have read this are you going to help me and everyone else change this system?

E222DEC2AB20,"Dear Florida senator,

I'm a young student, and no I don't have much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I believe it does.

Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't voting for a President but we're voting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just voting for those electors, we are voting for the whole idea behind their campaiging. We don't vote for the person, we vote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By having this process, we can focus on getting swing states votes. The votes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in ""

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President

"", ""swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election."" This helps avoid run-on elections because the small states are likey to just vote for the most popular President, knowing their vote won't really make a difference.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that gives all of the electors to the winning candidate. However, there are a few states that have variation with the ""proportional representation"" idea. The ""winner-take-all"" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to give all of the votes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process v. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidental process one step easier.

And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article ""

What Is the Electoral College?

"" states that, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The process we created as the United States, has its up and downs but it is one of the longest standing traditions we have. Hopefully you take my letter in to consideration. Thank you for reading.

The Electoral College is a process in which a numerous 538 electors cast there vote from the people of their state want as their president. The people have no interaction but to put in there ballet and choose there own electors who favor the candidate. Congress counts the votes, and if a total of 270 votes are cast for a candidate then they are elected president. For most people this how they think this is but it's not. Who chooses the Electors the answer is the state. So the sometimes the popular vote never wins, but that that happens rarely.

Many people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole dislike the idea of Electoral College for this reason, the popular vote sometimes never wins. Al Gore who won popular vote but lost the presidency to Bush, lost the because of the Electoral College people believed that this was unfair and blamed the electoral college. But there is some benefits to the process, example is that if the people voted the states with the larges population would always keep the balance unchecked,or if there there is a tie in the popular vote we wouldn't have to rely on a thousand voters to decide. But the voters of the Electoral College to decide.

There are some draw backs to the process though. Since the number of electors are the based on the population of a state most state with few population numbers, careless about the election.

We should abolish electoral college, its unfair and non-democratic. The presidents  seat should be based on popular votes as the winner. Instead of this Electoral college that is clearly unfair  and has no clear outcome, look at what happened in 2000.

As stated in paragraph 16,""Gore had popular votes"" but less electoral votes than Bush ,and Bush won that year. The problem is the

PEOPLE

are not voting for who should be president,its the electors that are electing the new or next president. This is so flawed needs to be changed like now.

The collage electoral process does have its benefits like if a president candidate increased his popularity in states he knew he could win popularity in, That would gain no electoral votes. The winner take all method sounds like a great idea. As stated in paragraph 20,The most thoughtful voters should be ones to to decide the election, but their is a flaw with that even the most thoughtful people in the world make mistakes. Look at what happened with Nixon. The president is only one person. People make mistakes. Let the People make mistakes instead of forcing everything into a box like congress.

A elector doesn't have to vote for a president you voted for because your are actually voting for that candidate elector, Witch is so confusing.

3C19A6EF8BC7,"Many people believe in the Electoral college, but I think it's time for a change. The electoral college isn't completely fair to the people. It isn't fair because the elected person that will vote for you could always change the vote so he may vote for whom they like. Instead of electing somone to vote for you and your state, you should be able to vote individually.

The popular vote is more fair than the Electoral vote because each person's vote will go toward the canidate of their choice knowing that their vote will count as much as everyone elses. This will most likely result in more people voting and a smaller chance of a tie. Just because someone is representing their voters, doesn't mean that everyone will be happy with the electoral voter's decision. People who are for the Electoral college claim that it invariably produces a clear winner. This is partially true but is not completely true. It might produce a clear winner, but it is not a fair vote. If America is about rights, fairness, and freedom then why do we let other people vote for us?

The electoral overthrows the popular vote, so why should we let 500 people decide who beomes President for millions of people? We shouldn't. The Electoral college is out of date and if anything it needs to be updated so it is more just and fair for everyone. Even in source three it clearly states that the people do not vote for the President- the electors do. So when you vote, you're not even voting for a President. You're voting for an elector. Those for the Electoral college also say that the turst between an elector and state is rarely broken, but why take a chance on someone betraying you when you can just vote for yourself?

Then there is the vote in Congress which is congress making there vote and they use the popular vote to help decide. But this was all established by the founding fathers to be a compromise.

In the electoral college you have 538 electors and 270 is the majority of the votes required to elect the president. Your state has a certain amount electors to go when Congress has it's vote. your states running canidate has their own group of electors  from there polotical party. states have laws on how they are selected to be in the canidates group and they also have a say in what their responsibilities are.

the president stays in office for four years then after those for years they hold a new election and the president can run again and can be elected back into office but they may only serve as president twice but once youhave elected your president you have everyone in state office that went in and voted in the congress vote. i think that the popular vote is much easier and that we shouoldnt have the state represenetives going to vote in the electoral college. the state oard of represenitives can vote along with the citezens that vote in with the popular vote.

to conclude the popular vote makes much more sense then having the electoral college.

BC2333002957,"Dear state senator,

There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electoral college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this arguement, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electors. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electoral college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electors to represent its population (Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electors than California). It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more inprecise than popular voting methods. While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In '

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electoral college votes, as such in the case of Nixon vs Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electoral college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electoral college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electoral college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term.

I think the Electoral College shouldn't decide on electing the president. The electoral college only focuses on electors from the state that are pleged to one of the candidates trying to win presidency. The people are not actually voting who they want to become president. Somrtimes the Electoral College can take a long procces. If there is a tie between two candidates, meaning they both have 270 Electoral votes, the house of representatives would have to decide.

There are reasons for retaining the electoral college despite it's lack of democratic pedigree. Certainty of Outcome, if one of the candidates has the most electoral votes that candidate wins office. Onother would be the number of electors a state has, for instance, if one state has a bigger population than onother state it would contain more electoral votes for a candidate.

47C517E48BA4,"The time of the founding fathers is long gone. Times have changed which means we have to change our way of thinking. Our way of voting. The Electoral Colege needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their prefered president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people.

Initially, by keeping the Electoral College individuals are less incentivised to vote if they know there is little chance it will do anything. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Source 3, 23). However, by implimenting popular vote, many more people will want to vote knowing that even if their side does not get the majority vote in the state, it still counts for something. Also, from that same source it says ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College methos is not democratic in a modern sense."" (Source 2, 15). So one would have to ask if the source is even reliable if it contradicts itself. In addition, even if they usually vote ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" (Scource 2, 13). This shows that states with more electoral votes will have more power over the people. Clearly, the Electoral College is a problem and popular vote is a much better way to vote.

Furthermore, because some states old more power than others wen it comes to elections, presidents often ignore the ""smaller"" states looking only for votes. For example, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" (Source 2, 13). Candidates are not interested in the states, in the people, who do not give them enough votes. This is why the Electoral needs to be abolished and replaced with popular vote elections.

Moreover, just because a president wins the campaign, does not mean that the candidate won the people's votes, it only means that he won the Electoral College's votes. For example, in the 2000 election and the 1888 election, one party won even though majority of the votes went to the other. In the 2000 election, even though Gore had more popular votes than Bush, he still lost because he had fewer electoral votes. This shows that there is something broken in the system. Something that can't be changed and needs to be replaced. As you can see, popular votes are the way to go in such an important election like the presidential one with so much on the line.

In conclusion, the Electoral Colege needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their prefered president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people. The Electoral College might have been good in the past however, now it just complicated the process and is unfair.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I am writing to you today to address what everyone is talking about which is in fact the Electoral College. It has been that topic widely talked about so i decided to research what it actually means and why it causes contreversy. People have viewed the Electoral College as an anachronism and they argue it should be overruled by popular vote but it is a very strong way to select electors and it wouldn't be in use at the moment if it wasn't the right way. According to Bradford Plumer, the single best argument against the Electoral College is what is known as the disaster factor. After reading ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, it provided me with information like how it was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The founding fathers are very respected individuals mainly because they were of very great intelligence, so that proves how they came up with something professional.

Though it may seem that the abundance of people are in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States, there are people like I who believe and wish for the best like how keeping the Electoral College is the way to go. In 2000, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote happened but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. I agree with Richard A. Posner that it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, I am not the only one who agrees because the facts also prove him right. With being a senator or anyone in office comes alot of pressure, Yet luckily with the Electoral College comes reduction of that pressure. It provides a clear winner when there are times of crisis like for example a run-off election.

The states with a larger capacity (the large states) receive more electoral votes , that is why people argue that it may seem unfair that some states get more participation in the election than others but it is actually very fair since there is more people in that state. I personally believe that the people who argue about the votes are those in the smaller states who feel they dont get the right to vote, it may look unfair but if all states got the same amount of electoral votes given than not everyone in the larger states would get a saying. Also, that is not mentioning the Swing States which are the ones who focus on the ""toss-up"" states. With that pressure the toss-up states are more likely to pay attention the campaign and are the most thoughtful voters and that just proves they deserve to get a majority of votes given.

Considering it may look like changing the election to popular vote may be the right option because it has many small reasons, it is better to have 5 strong reasons than a million unimportant ones to keep something very important. So I congratulate you and the people in office for keeping an open mind of what ""we the people"" have to say but also for knowing that what is in place now is right and should stay this way.                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College has worked for many years but is becoming unfair to the average, everyday citizen.  I've recently analyzed the following articles: ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even best-laid defences are wrong"" by Bradford Plumner, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner. The United States of America should change to a popular vote for president to benefit the nation as a whole.

If we use the popular vote system, the nation as a overall unit will have some benefits in return. In, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumner, it argues, ""voters vote not for a president, but for a slate of electors"". This statement is very much true. Citizens may think they vote for president, only to realize that he or she is chosen for them. The worst part of all, most don't know who the electors are. To strengthen, in, ""What is the Electoral College"", by the Office of the Federal Register, it claims, ""the meeting of the electors where they vote for president"". If this comes to be true, why even let citizens vote? Under this system, thier votes don't contribute to the presidential election. The presidential election should be by popular vote of the people.

However, the Electoral College does have it's benefits. In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, it indicates, ""no voter's vote swings a national election"". This will allow the electors of each state to decide which president if better for the particular state. One voter's vote could choose the wrong president that harms the nation and doesn't help it.

It is clear to see that both sides have their own pros and cons, but the nation should use the system of popular vote. This allows the people of each state to choose which president benefits them.

I would rather want the changing of the election to popular vote because the Electoral college process causes many promblems. First is that it consists of 538 electors and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president(source 1). Also perhaps it leads into a tie in the electoral votings.... it could possibly lead into a deadlocked election(source 1). This process of electoral college does not give the full rights to the voters... its not fair.

My first reason why you guys should change the election to go by popular votes is it causes many promblems, 538 electors is consisted of and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. this tells me that NO people can vote which really does not give you the right to do that because people have always that right to vote. In addition to that it can lead to a big catastrophe. The electoral college process is unfair to voters.

The first reason why it think that we shouldnt change the Electoral College is because it has been doing us good for almost 300 years. Let me ask you a question, do you change or fix something thats not broken,Than why change the Electoral College. We have had fair Elections in the pass and we still do, people vote for who they want as president of the united states, and if they get the better half of the votes than they are president. As we saw in 2012 when ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him  and Romney....because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all- basis, even a cery slight popularity in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state"" which is in source 3.

The second reason why I think that we should keep the electoral college is because it would take time for us to get used to the new method. Since we vote every 4 years and if we get a new way to vote there will be a few that wont know how to vote the new way and when it comes for it to vote again people will forget how they voted for the president. So if they vote for the person who they actually dont want its not like they can vote again. But as I said earlier its easy to vote with the Electoral College as its a winner takes all. The electoral vote does have a couple flaws that could be changed easily but in all other ways the elctoral vote is the way to go.

The Electoral college process as you know ,consist of selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, ant the counting of the electorial votes by Congress (Source 1). Under the electorial college system voters don't vote for president, they vote for a slate of electors that in turn elect for president. Some may think ""What the problem with that it seems like a simple process"" but thats not how it works. Imagine the small states, no canidate is going to spend time in a state where they have no chance of winning making it unfair to voters. Theres is also the chance of many segregationists where they don't even take into consideration on who their voting for only basing it on race and or ethnicity. Electoral college is a ""Disaster Factor""(Source 2).Many thing can happen in the mist of this selection where the results can end up in a tie which would cause worries. Electoral college is irrational, unfair, and outdated and shouldnot be as a system anymore.

This ""system"" is unfair to many places across the United States. No canidate would bother going to spend time in a state where they have no chance of winning making it unfair to voters. During the 200 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters 25 ofthe largest media markets didn't get to see the canidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25ofthe largets media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad (Source 2).Seventeen states didn't even see canidates making it a harder decision for those states causing somepeople to not even bother voting. Some may think ""It isn't the canidates faulty that those people didnt vote"" but yes it is the statement is also on opinion and not facts so its not look into carefully.

There you go it's finally the day to find out the winner and then out of know where you dont find out you know why because of a worry that is a tie. When there is a tie it completely    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I belive that Electoral college is unfair in many ways, and maybe it would be good to keep the election by popular vote for the United States. The reasons why changing the election to Electoral college would be; smaller states would not see the candates because they would go to the bigger states like California, Texas and other states that are bigger then ohio or south carolina some of this states didn't even see a campaing ad how sad is that because this country is know for the equalness off every one but yet the electoral college forgets about seventeen states that are small because their vote doesn't matter.?

Keeping the election by popular vote would be the best. The fact that the people of the United States are able to see and vote for whom they perfer not the electors who elect the president. You might think that keeping the electoral college election is not as bad or unfair because it can help elect a president when the one of the presidents vote are majotite of vote it can help a run off election but I beive the best way to select the president of the U.S would be by letting the people chosse what they think is the best so the people know they are noticed in this contry.                      ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F6F4D85648D6,"The Electoral College is a process that should be around for plenty of years to come.

It was established by our founding father as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualitified citizens. It's a simple process in which a running candidate would need a majority of 270 electoral votes.

Our founding fathers came up with this process in order for the election of a President to run smoothly. When using the Electoral College you have an exact percentage of the outcome of the votes, no guessing or estamating. The Electoral College has a method of awarding electoral votes, inducucing the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met. Some may say that the winner-take-all system isn't fair to some states because most of the candidates don't even bother going to the states that they know they have no chance in winning. Well this can be argued by saying that this method may help the candidates because if they know that they have no chance in winning in some states, they might specifically prepare a certain speech that may persuade the state to vote for them. Also no voter's vote swings a national election.

The electoral college has many ways that can help a candidate win the election and it might make things more easier for him/her. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the mal-appotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution.  Some may say that the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote is something to worry about. But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a run-off election. If there was no Electoral College, this would put pressure for run-off elections, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which it invariably produces a clear winner.

So all in all, the Electoral College should be kept and stay the way it is. It isn't complicated and makes the election run more smoothly. It provides multiple ways for a candidate to win the vote of a certain state and avoids major problem during the election.                            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
19AEDCFA6EF1,"Dear state senator,

I trying to understand why we have the system of choosing our state's electors when you vote for president beacuse when you vote for your candidant you are actualy voting for your candidante's electors. This process is easier for most individuals beacause you do not have to sit in a room, for hours, counting up millions of votes; all you have to do is count up the elector's votes in stead. This process is what our founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. How can you be a qualified citizen, arent we all the same? I know that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. So, another thing that I would like to know is do you believe that this process that has been going on for ages is still a acturate system.

Does voting for people to vote for the president of your choice is a great idea. Does it not seem a bit ludacris that you have to choose your state electors in order for your vote to be counted since you think that who you pick as the electors will actually pick the vote you wanted. Why cant we vote for our won presient, why should we have to go through someone to vote for our president. It has been known that president's may be the popular vote winner, but still can lose the presidency. Why is that? Individuals that vote on their electors can not always control who their electors choose for president. Occasionally, sometimes the electors you pick will not vote for his or her party's candidate; they will cast a vote for whomever they please.

Some of these candidates that people choose are what you call ""faithless"" electors because of the winner-takes-all system. This means that most candidates do not spend time in states they know that they have no chance of winning. Meaning, they only stay focused on the ""swing"" states which in other words means the states that will either go for the person they like or against him. During the 2000 campaign, 17 state had not even seen their candidates at all and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not get to see a single campaign ad. So, tell me why we are still using this same system that cheats citizens out of their votes. Is it beacuse we are not qualified citizens?

If you do not already know by now the electoral college is a process, not a place and this process needs to be abolished. Who picks these electors, are they just people like you and I or are they the qualified citizens. They can be anyone not holding an office and the state actually chooses the electors. So, this means that the people really have no place in the president election. The electors are chosen by the state and even if you choose those electors they can go against what you decide and choose who ever they want. What happened to what the people wanted, why are those candidates choosing who runs our country for four years. What did they do so amazing that they get the final say on the matter. No, they are like us so why should we have to go through them just so we can make sure are vote matters in electing the president. Most of America has to deal with making sure are kids are getting a good eduacation, making sure are water or light bill is paid every month, and we also have deal with getting up at seven in the morning working and not coming home untill eleven at night all the while praying that our kids are safe since we could not pay for a nanny. With all of these things worrying us, putting a lot of stress in our minds one of the only things that we should not have to worry about is if our vote is going to count in electing our president. In conclusion, I believe, senator, that we should change our election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D908D3E78CB6,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I believe that America should keep the Electoral College to elect the president of the United States. I believe this because the Electoral College makes a guarenteed outcome, it gives proper representation to big states, and the president has to have a trans-regional appeal.

The Electoral College has more of a certainty of outcome for an election. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes (a very convincing number) but only 51.3% of the popular vote (not as convincing). The Electoral College also avoids the problem of a tie in the votes. Even though the Electoral College has 538 votes, which would make it possible for a tie, it is very unlikely that there is a tie in the Electoral College. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 only received 43% of the popular votes, but won 301-237 in the Electoral College. Bill Clinton in 1992 had only 43% of the popular vote, but also won 370-168. The pressure of a run-off election is reduced with the Electoral College.

The Electoral College gives the big states more representation than the smaller states. For example, Florida has 29 Electoral votes, while a state like Maine only has 4. In 2012, the popular vote was really close in Florida, but Obama won and got 29 electoral votes. If the same thing happened in Maine, the winner would only receive 3 Electoral votes. If America used the popular vote to decide who won,  the win by a few votes would mean almost nothing, and the big states would have the same representation as the small states.

The president can't win the election by just winning one region of states. The Electoral College has made it that the candidate would have to have a trans-regional appeal. This is desirable for most people because a president that is only popular in one region, and not everywhere will not be a good prsident. This is why candidates don't campaign in places that they know they will win, and branch out to the swing states. These swing states basically decide the election. They are the states that do not favor either the democratic or republican candidate, so they have important votes. If swing states go one way, so will the election. This is why many candidates campaign in these Swing States.

As you can see Mr. Senator, the Electoral College is the best way to go for electing a new president. It has a more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote, it gives more representation to the bigger states, and requires appeal from people all over America, not just people in one region.                                  ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

We should definitely strive in keeping the electoral college for so many reasons. We need to keep the electoral college because it serves so many purposes in the united states. It hepls us decide who our president and vice presidents will be and it is a big help on our state workers.

And most of the reason that people want to stop it is because they think that some of the nominees arent getting what they deserve. We do understand that they put a lot of work in trying to become president but not everyone can win. And to be fair, after the presidential election is over, our govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candiates who ran for president in our state along with the names of their respective electors.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are usually voting for your candidates electors.

Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the elecotrs are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. So when you vote for your president your acually voting for the slate of electors.

Having this Electoral College is so much help to our state workers. They dont actually have to do everything now...thanks to the Electoral College.

So please strive to help keep the Electoral College.

E26A84252465,"Dear State Senator, most people in this country may argue that th Electoral College is well layed out system in which according to source #3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"", which means presidents are always looking for support from small states, which is based on population, to be voted for because in the big states little to no votes are accepted by the Electoral College. I disagree, I believe that this method is wrong and unfair for the peope so I argue against it.

To begin with, according to source #2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states"", this means that in some states one candidate might have a better chance of winning than the other candidate and even though a candidate is at disadvantage because the other takes all the votes because of the electoral college that candidate might win and the people of that state will not even know who is this winning candidate until they see him on tv as an actual prsident, which probably means that the winning candidate won't help that state because he does not know well enough about it. Additionally, acording to source #3 ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney ws in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plularity in states that he knows he will win"", this means that in order to win the presidency a candidate must get to know other regions but because in this case Mitt Romney vs. Barrack Obama, Obama was the regional favorite for the North Romney was at a disadvantage, which is what the Electoral College ultimately wants.

To conclude with, I think that the method of using the Electoral College to elect presidents is wrong and unfair. Furthermore, according to source #2 ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdate, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" this means that the electoral college is just not fit for the modern democrat world of today and mostly people argue against it.

A3960A410B74,"Dear Senator,

My friends father always complains about how the voting systems work here in the U.S. He believes that the electoral votes should not really matter. He strongly leans on the idea that candidates should win an election by the popular votes. Although the Electoral College has helped with many situations before, like the 2000 election, when Al Gore had the more popular votes then Bush yet, fewer electoral votes. I'm started to believe that changing the electoral votes to popular votes would be better for elections of presidents.

Replacing the electoral college with popular votes would be better for elections of presidents because, it's the peoples choice. For examlpe, people vote for the candidates that they more relate too and their choices. Having the electoral college around can make an impact to their choice. Say if a majority of a state vote for a candidate, but the state doesn't have enough electoral votes for that canididate to take a lead or win the election. How can they get there favorite candidate to win the election? The electoral college is blocking that way for that particular state. In brief, people need their say for their favorite candidate instead of the electoral college giving them points.

However, the electoral college has some pros for the candidate and also the states. For instance, the states of california has many electoral points for candidate to win an election. I believe there are fifty-three for that states because they have many representatives. If the majority of the people in the state vote for a democrat or a republicin the electoral points goes to either one of them. Giving that candidate big points to even take a lead in the election.

To wrap it up, the electoral college do have pros and cons in a election. The electoral college can give a candidate the election. But the popularity vote are for the people and by the people. I stiil stay towards to the idea that the popularity vote is a greater way for voting. Remember it does say We The People in the Declaration of Independence which was sighn by our founding fathes.

I know  you have a lot of things on your mind, but I really felt the need to address the way we vote for our president of the United States. Instead of using the Electoral College, I think we should select the president by popular vote. We, the people should be allowed to control who our president is and that not always likely to happen. We can't control whomever our electors vote for. If you keep reading you will see my reasonings for not favoring the Electoral College.

First of all, I favor changing to election by popular vote because of something we might call the ""disaster factor."" Us Americans should consider the fact about how back in 2000, there was one of the biggest fiascos of the century because of the election process. Just think about how state legislatures can just pick electors, and those electors they chose can defy the will of the people. Even if we go back even further to the 1960's the segregationists of the Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones, who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Secondly, I would perfer that he election was decided by the popular vote becayse some people refuse to vote. ""These electors are called ""faithless"" electors. They refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please""  stated in souce 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, in paragraph 11.

Last but not least of all, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Only because of the winnwer-take-all system in each state. Because of this system, candidates don't spend time in states they know dont have a chance of winning. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Back in 2000, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all, which is not right.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I would rather have the decision to vote for our president by using the most popular vote. I feel that we don't actually get to make the decision of who our president actually is. I would like to say that the electoral college is unfair, irrational and outdated.  All in all ,My opinion is that Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

2099CD327374,"Dear Senator,

I believe that people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole were all right in saying the electoral college should be abolished. I have two simple reasons for this. One being that it is not a 100% way to elect a entire nations leader for four years. The other reason being that 60% of people don't even want it.

First off, the process of the elcetoral college isn't always accurate. For example, in 2000, Al Gore ran for office against George W. Bush. During this election, Al Gore won the votes of the people, but lost in electoral votes, giving the presidency to George. Since we all know how his presidency turned out, we wonder how Gore would've handled things. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for, which means if an elector is chosen to vote for Billy Joe, he might just decide, when it becomes time, to vote for Jimmy Washington. This would leave voters of that candidate upset, so maybe they too will understand this flawed system. Another reason we need to abolish the electoral college is something we like to call the disaster factor. This is nothing compared to what happened in 2000; the system allows for much worse. Consider that a states legislature is technically responsible for picking said states electors. Also consider that said elector could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, electors without faith, have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast their vote for whomever they please. Ask yourself Senator, if this were to happen again, would you do what is right and try to dispose of this system? I hope so.

In reference to my second point, do you realize that (According to a Gallup poll) 60% of our people don't even want this system. The way I see it, if i asked three people if I should buy a new car or a used car, and two out of the three say I should buy a used one, I'm not going to go buy a new car despite them. This is the same with the electoral college. We shouldn't be forcing this corrupt way of decididng this nations leader for the next four years, down their throat. This nation is based on beliefs that include the peoples right to have a say in how this nation is goverened. It's so simple, a majority of the people are against the electoral college, so it needs to go. If you, like 60% of the United States agree with my points and views on the electoral college, then you need to do what you can with your authority, to put a stop to it.

All in all, I have strong beliefs, like most Americans, that the electoral college is a corrupt way of giving this great nation to somebody who people think don't deserve it. Based on my emphasis of these two reasons that this failing system needs to go, I think you , Senator, need to put all your power into the downfall of it.

Every four years on the first tuseday in November we the citizens of the Unites States Of America vote for the next persident to be in office. As you already know for this to happen the they must have all the Electoral College or Election popluar vote. Which is not how elcetions should be conducted. It should only be based off of popular votes.

Voters do not ways have control as to whom their electors vote for. Sometimes it can be anyone not holding public office. In the second sourse titled

The Idefensiable Electoral College it states, "" Who are electors? they can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committe, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" This indicates that voters have dont really have control. The electoral college votes has many reason for being unfair to voters, and the winner-take-all is one of many. Line thirteen of the second sourse, it states ""the electoral college is unfair. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state"" this indicates that candidates did not and will not spend time in states there they won't win votes. They focus on larger states to gain there votes. It has been said

"" the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational.""

With this Electoral vote should be eliminated from the final vote. With the popular votes the elcetion can be a fair race to presidence

Bob Dole stated

"" Abolish the electoral college!""

. There are many reasons why elcetoral college should be abolished. But In the defence of The electoral votes this can be the tie breaker. If the candidates come to a tie in popular votes The electoral votes will establish which one recieved the most electoral college votes. But this should only be used in case of a tie in popular votes. ""Elcetoral votes is a lack of democratic pediagree."" Within no region is there enough electoral votes to elect a president. A candidate with regional appeal isn't like to secced the presidency because the other regions will feel excuded. the region will feel as if the president doesn't not care for there interest. People believe that wil the elcetoral votes their votes will have no effect. In the section "" run off elections it states ""

they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were to picked by popular vote...""

This implies with the electoral college is not fair because voters vote and their vote has no effect on the election, because its based off of the electoral college. And this isnt fair!

To Solve this problem there should be absolutly no more electoral votes during elcetion. All ecetions should be based off of popular votes. you have the power to correct this issue so i should be done. Electoral votes dont give a fair chances. With that being said Elctoral votes should be elinimated from voting the next president.

Electing our president through electoral votes takes care of minor problems such as favorism of regions .Each state is giving electoral votes based on their population , no region such as south, north, east, ect.. has enough electoral votes to choose a president.(source 3 paragraph 19) "" So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"" A president with a favorite region may make the rest of the country feel like their votes doesn't count and the new president will show no attention to their interests and their problems.

In all honestly, getting rid of the Electoral College is for the best. It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people.

Source 2 states that the Electoral college is unfair for the voters because the candidates don't go to states they don't have a chance of winning, because of the winnner-take-all system. The candidates only focus on the tight races in the swing states. Sorce 2 also claims that in the 2000 election, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all! That's pretty rediculous. And voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad.

In the Electoral College system, voters dont only vote for the president, but for electors, who also vote for the president. Then again, in source 2, the article says the the electors that were voted for can vote for anyone they choose. That's some tricky business.

Voters can't control who the electors vote for. Electors aren't even voted for by the people. They sometimes come from state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. The second article says that the legislature is responsible for picking the electors. And these electors coukd always go against what the people want.

Article 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.

Although we are the ""Democracy of the USA"" we are really a republic (chosing representives to vote for us!) This system is much more effective then an ATCHUAL democracy. Just imagine if on every single issue every single person would have to vote on the outcome to pass anything would take such a long time.

Some people don't trust the electorates with this kind of power  but I belive that those people are just parnoid pessmist and need to learn to have more faith in the people that we elect or the president appoints. The only flaw I see is the even number which calls for a tie. Also the winner takes all system should be changes I belive that each of the electorates should only have a certin percentage of the votes example: Alaska has 3 electorates, each are assigned 33.33333...% of the population and of course due to the decimals one electorate will have a bit more votes all the votes are then added. 76% voted Republican while 22% voted Democrat and the remaining 2% voted for third parties then the first elector would recive the votes of the 22% and the 2% and do fill up the rest of his 33% he would have 9% Republican his vote goes to the Democrates but the other two are left with only Republicans so there are 2 votes for republicans and the learger the population the more electors because of the increased ammount of citizens that each elector votes on behalf. This way the indivaduals that voted democrate are shown but did not really make as much an impact but it shows and may decide the out come during a tie.

For each state has his or her own group of electors chosen by the candidate's political party.

The presidential election is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in november. What most states do is have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Then win the election is over the governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""with every candidate who ran for president names on it. That means who ever won it represents your state for when you try running for president. The certificate is sent to the congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

For some reason a lot of presidents wanted to get rid of the electoral college such as Richard Nixon , Jimmy Carter ,and Bob Dole. Apparently people would rather have wanted a direct election to the kind we have now. When you use the Electoral College your not just voting for a president your voting for a slate also. Which could also lead to the disaster factor , when everyone has an arguement against the electoral college. Usually the only problem would have to  be a tie in the electoral vote , in case the election would be thrown to the House of representatives were they vote on the president.

The Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system in each state. Candidates don't spend enough time in states they know they probably don't have a chance at winning so they focus only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states. Even though it is unfair it is widely regarded it just tells whoever person got more votes. Did you know when you vote for a president you are actually voting for a slate for electors. So you dont have to always blame the Electoral College its you who is putting the vote into it.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a process not a place that takes in the number of votes for a presidential election. Our founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president. Ever state has thier own Electoral College , and it tells which candidate has won so they can represent are state in the presidential election. It also helps process by keeping votes in for our vice president and our president of the United States. That is why we have the Electoral College , now tell me do you think we should always use the Electoral college.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I think that we should change to election by popular votes for president. Why have citizens vote when you're going to decide president by electoral votes? The person running with the most votes should win. Let the citizens decide who they want as president.

The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. Which is why people went against the electoral college. It could be worse, nobody wants that. They might be worrying about a tie in the electoral vote.

The election is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. The electoral college is unfair to voters. I don't think the electoral college votes are neccessary to decide a president. I am pretty sure ,any people agree.

Many people that were presidence got lucky because of the electoral votes. There are many people that ran for president but lost because of the electoral votes when they shouldn't have lost. Nobody wants a close tie to see who the president is. Electoral college just ruins the point of our rights to vote.

We, as citizens, shouldn't have electoral college to decide who our president is. We should be able to vote and decide the president. The candidates running should win by the most votes. I'm against electoral college.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

To start off with, its more simplier than the Electoral College. The reason why it simplier is because its much fast and easy than the electoral college. For example,""Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, somethimes the state party's central committee, somethimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom thier electors vote for? Not always.

Another example,""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This quote explains that the electoral college is outdated and should be changed.

The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.

Another example ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality elections are spurious at best"". This quote explans that we should abolish the electoral college and it also points out the flaws of it.

The Electoral College should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This should change because the people have the right to have their opinion go to what is being voted on,not some else choice also because it's like people are voting for something they don't want foresfuly.  The United States is a what we call a democracy meaning the country is lead by the power of the people.

So when two people have an idea to make something better and another person has a different idea they each want to others to hear their ideas. Each person will have their reasons on why they think the way the way they think and the peolpe will have to make a desicion on what the they think is best for their community and their country. The United States is a democracy which means it is lead by the people. It's the people say. So when someone votes they expect their vote count against what they are going for. You making a desicion and someone else who is higher than you changes it makes voting ironic. Why vote? Just make them do the whole election. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president""(Plumer).

In the United States we are not forced to do anything really. Especially when it comes to choosing. Everybody thinks differently so why should someone else vote for the choice of the people. It's like we are voting for someone we don't want when someone higher that you is voting for you. Each stae has their own number of electoral votes but it shouldn't be that way because it the president your voting for is in a tie and he need those votes the people would know that their votes are helping the person they want to see win. But when the electors choose something else the people cant think that. Sometime the electors refuse to vote for the their party's canidate. which makes the situation even terrible.

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong paragraph 11 it says ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please."" So why even waste time on telling people to vote if someone else will choose for you sometimes not what you want.

In the end having to count so many votes could be dificult and when counting it could lead to mistakenly counted. But we the people make our own desion for our own good.

5FE588C6DDB5,"As stated in the article, the Electoral College process consists of the selction of the electors, the meeting of the electors, where they vote for PPresident and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. A state's entitled number of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional Delegation. There is one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two for every Senator. There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College. The two biggest reasons are as follows: Unfair elections and the freedom of the people.

As stated in the third source, the Electoral College is often considered an anachonism and is unliked across the nation. The reasons for which vary greatly from certainty of outcome to big states to swing states. Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be cosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that recieve more atention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed.

Citizens of the United States of America are the ones who are supposed to decide who should be the President of the United States of America. It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are out-weighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States; they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.

I hope that the voting process will change. I hope that it will finally become fair. That it will become what the people want it to be. It should be what the people want it to be. We the people of the United States have the power to change this, and we should work to change it. The voting process should no longer be the Electoral College but should be dicided by the people and only the people.

6338DA32662A,"Dear senator,

I agree with keeping the Electoral College until it pulls off a mistake. The Electoral College has no real reason to be changed or modified. It's served its purpose with almost no flaws for years now. Let's take a look at why we should keep our Electoral College.

Our Electoral College is a system made to ensure fair voting for our president based off of how many Senators you have, and how many state representatives you have. This is a fair way of voting because of regardless of you population, everyone has the same amount of senators. This is to ensure a small state like Deleware has the same voice to match a big state like Texas. According to Source 3, one of the main concerns for people who want to abolish the Electoral College is that the people are not actually voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors. But in source 3 it states, "" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"". This state the although the vote doesn't go directly to the presidents vote, it is most common for the trusted slate of electors vote for the president.

Another concern for people who want to abolish the Electoral College as stated in Source 2 is,""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" If the vote were to be tied then the election will be handed over to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Each state gets only one vote so another concern is that the state representatives will not be able to vote what everyone in the state wants because the number of people would be too much to keep up with. First, why would a state turn its back on the majority vote of who their state wants to be president? If a state should do this, their representative would not be representing their state, therfore they maybe punished of may hear about it from the public. Not only are the representatives not expected to miss vote what their state wants, but also what are the chances of theirbeing a tie. It has never happened before, and the closest its gotten is over 8,000 people having to agree on a single same person. This is an absurd number for people to abide to the same person from different states. Its hard to find people in the same room to agree, let alone 8 thousand people! It just seems to extra-ordinary for their to be a tie in the electoral college.

Although there are many pro's, there are also just a few con's. A large con that should be avoided is what source 2 calls,""the disaster factor."" The legislature is responsible for picking the electors and they have all therights to defy what the people want. A clear example of this would be as stated in source 2,""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislaturenearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"". Should the legislature had been able to pull that off, it could have changed the vote and stopped Kennedy from being president. But seeing as segregation isn't as big of an issue in the U.S, this isn't as prone to happen.

As you can see Mr. Senator, there are many reasons why we should keep the Electoral College until it makes a mistake. The pro-to-con ratio is largely in correspondence to keeping the Electoral College. As long as it continues to do its job, and no one abuses it, I'm in favor of it.

As it may have come to yourn notice I would like to foucus your attention to the debate about the Electoral Collage.

E4426C4EBD19,"Dear State Senator,

Many people today have very strong oppinions on why or why not we should keep the Electoral College. I am writing to you today to tell you some of the reasons why the Electoral College should not be used anymore.

The Electoral College, like most things, has room for error. However this is the type of error that you want to try as hard as possible to avoid. Any error here could lead to the false election of a President and Vice President. Now maybe the falsely elected President and Vice President have some wonderful ideas on how to help our country as a whole, but in carrying out their wonderful sounding plans, may have to hurt or cut back other resources to do so which could hurt us. This is just one example of how the Electoral College can go wrong.

The Electoral College has been used for many years and has become an anachronism. We consider ourselves a democracy yet we use a non-democratic method of selecting a president. With the Electoral College comes the certanty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of his/her Electoral College usually exceeds the share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires the president to be a candidate with a trans-regional appeal. Any candidate with regional appeal is very unlikely to be succeful as president. The residents of the other regions will most likely feel disenfranchised and that this candidate is not really their president. The swing states tend to pay closer attention to the campaigns and to really listen to what the competeing candidates have to say. The residents in the swing states tend to be the most thoughtful voters. In the Electoral College, they try to restore a political balance between the large and the small states. With the Electoral College you avoid the problem of an election where no candidate recieves a majority vote which would complicate the presedential election process.

All of these reasons are great and everything but there is always going to be a flaw in the system. Some believe that is is the people who vote in the presidents, however, all we are doing is electing the slate of electors who are are the real people who elect the president. In the Electoral College there is a disaster factor. The electors chosen could always defy the will of the people. These electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for and some voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The most worrying part though is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If a tie were to happen, the election would be thrown off to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations would vote on the president. Due to the fact that each state casts only one vote, one single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have just as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who are representing 35 million voters. The House's selection can hardly be expected to  refelct the will of the peple in the states. The elections can be only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters in its most basic level. Due to the winner-take-all system that is in place in each state, the candidates don't spend as much time if any at all in the states they know they have no chance of winning, and spend most of if not all of their time on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Like everything it would take some timw to get used to the changes and I understand that. I also understand that election by popular vote has its flaws as well. It is time to change from an outdates, irrational, and unfair method. Thank you for your time and consideration about this. I hope you consider changing from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.

8FA286B4FAE3,"I think the Electoral College need changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State . Because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiaso was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

If anyoune has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

B53ED19CD783,"Presidential elections have always been decided by electoral votes. The elections today should be voted on using popular votes. All though electoral votes keeps the amount of work tallying up votes down; popular votes will give you a more accurate percentage of votes each candidate recieves.

Initially, when you use popular votes to decide a victor, there will be a more accurate percentage or number of votes per candidate. Popular votes are counted by each individual voter. This allows a more accurate voting scale to be used, since there is an exact number of voters. Electoral votes are based on a state's population and each region in the state is assigned a democratic elector. This only accounts for the majority of the population's votes, which means some voters' votes are irrevelant if the majority voted for an opposing candidate.

Additionally, counting popular votes, while time consuming, is worth the effort. Popular votes, when used, are to make sure that everybody is accounted for in the poll. More people would probably vote if they knew that their vote actually matters. When popular votes are used it may take a longer time to tally all of those up than it would for electoral votes, it shows exactly how many people are actually voting. This will let the government know how many votes they should expect to see on each poll.

In summation, popular votes, though time consuming, are a better way of electing a new president; instead of electoral votes. Electoral votes are an easier and faster means of counting votes but, popular votes show and acount for everybody that contributes to the poll and/or election. Using popular votes will most likely make more people want to vote, since they can see the amount of voters instead of the number of regions through out the country.

People that are chosen are more cnoledgable and smarter to vote than people that vote just to say that they voted without looking and knowing why they voted for that President and not for the other.

That is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

The first reason as to why I favor in abolishing the Electoral college is because you can not always trust the electors. As shown back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. Also, due to the winner-take-all system, candidates do not spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, it is obvious that they just want to win and you can not trust those candidates, especially the people who promise to do things they know they can not fulfill. The electors that ""the people vote for"" do not want to help their state, they do not even care for the needs of the people, they are just there for the money. Another reason as to why you can not trust the electors is because it is known that the electors can vote for whomever they choose and forget about the people's needs. One of the main reasons as to why this causes disintrest in potential voters. If the people vote directly for the president they have a better chance in speaking up and fighting for what they want therefore, trusting. Those are some of the rights that are taken away by the electoral college and people do not even realize it.

Another reason as to why I believe the electoral college should be abolished is because the electoral college is unfair to voters. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half of the people! If the government really cared for what the people want, the electoral college would have been abolished by now. Studies have shown that only half of the people living in the U.S have voted in the pasts elections. If you really want the number of voters to increase and for citizens of the U.S to express their political preferences you should actually listen to them and abolish the electoral college.

Lastly, the electoral college prevents voters from controling who they vote for. Many voters now in days believe that when they vote, their one vote decides the election but, they are wrong. If they abolish the electoral college the voters would have a better chance in having who they want for president. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference we'll have more citizens voting if the electoral college is abolished. How do you expect for U.S citizens to vote and express themselves if they are not heard?            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

We let them have a ""winner-take-all"" system as stated in paragraph 7 from an excerpt from "" What Is The Electoral College "". Why do we need make the District of Columbia like their own state , why should we go threw all the hassel of putting certain numbers of electors for each state when we can just go with popular vote. The vote we have.

Why do we need such an abomination for voting, when we can all vote for the person we want to win the election not, just some group of electors Democratic or Republican so they can vote for us .

We as the

PEOPLE

should have the right to vote for our selves. It's such a crazy process ,we could just as easly mess up who we voted for , it's not always very clear .

WE

dont even really vote for our Electors. ""Well who does ? "" you ask. The state conventions ,sometimes the state party , sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. We should be lucky that the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a century ; but this process could end up getting much worse like in 1960. The segregtions almost led to no more Democratic electors. We still proceed with all evidence as to why we shouldnt have Electoral Colleges.

We do have democratic electors but the Electoral College is a very non-democratic process. People in favor of this say even since 2000 when Gore had more popular votes than Bush but fewer electoral votes it hadn't since 1888 . We are the the people we should have a voice that rings loud and clear , not one who whispers under the big booming voice of the people the higher leaders think have a bigger say. We should be the majority not the minority. Even in favor of the Electoral college you can see the many flaws that have come about the age old process. You have the swing states that follow a ""winner-take-all"" method.

Then we have the big states that use some of their large states. like in Florida the 2012 election the state had a very close popular vote and got 29 electoral voates. Then it came down to Wyoming with 3 electoral votes and it took all.

Now I hope you can see why We should toss the Electoral College out the second story window. The vote's come to close to call in a lot of these runnings. The people we vote for can always turn their backs. Plus it just gets to caiotic to handle even when we treat the district of Columbia a state.

A54A1822C7AE,"Dear Senator,

We the people of the United States of America, desire a president who will not only care for the wellbeing of the citizens, but know what to do during times of crisis. The Electoral College is but one method of deciding this. There are many reasons as to why we need the Electoral College, and there are many reasons one can list of why we do not need it. If we were to get rid of the Electoral College completely and determine the win on the vote of the American citizens, chaos would ensue. Let's be honest, there are plenty of voters who have no idea what they are doing. If America were to base who would lead and call the shots of the country on the votes of everybody, then one person would end up being in office who is no better a ruler than a goldfish.

The Electoral College is noted as a process, not a place. This is correct. You don't just walk up to the Electoral College and say ""hey, this is who you should put into office"". Each state in the U.S. has a certain number of representatives(electors). For example, D.C.(is treated like a state) has 3 electors. People may say that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. While in some aspects this can be true, but if the electors know what they are doing and are willing to stay true to their country, then maybe the correct person would be elected in. The EC is known to require a Presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A trans-regional appeal is when one area of the U.S. is known to be in favor of the presidential candidate.

Among the other things the Electoral College is known as being, it has been widely regarded as an anachronism. An anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not fit into the present time. While yes, the Electoral College is very old, it does have its uses. It is perhaps one of the final things that will determine what direction this great country gets set into, be it forwards or backwards. The larger the population of a state, the larger number of electors it has. Most of the states in the U.S. have what is called a ""winner takes all"" system. This system will award all of the electors to the presidential candidate that wins the election.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, what is known as the AFL-CIO, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce all agreed on just one thing. That thing that they all agreed on was to abolish the Electoral College. Over sixty percent of the U.S. population would rather have a direct election  over what we currently use. Out of all the arguments against the Electoral College, one of the ""best"" is the Disaster Factor. One of the other worrying views on the Electoral College is what would occur if there were to be a tie in the vote. If a tie were to occur, the election would thus be thrown in the hands of the House of Representatives.

While there are many reasons to like, and dislike the Electoral College, one of the most re-assuring should be that it (most of the time) will keep idiots out of the Oval Office. Among the reasons to dislike the Electoral College is that it is unfair, and keeps the majority of American people from using their voice. The Electoral College is the fine line between a country going backwards and causing the rest of the world to hate it, and a country going forwards, causing the rest of the world to hold it to a higher degree. If theres anything that the American people should want, it is a powerful and respectable leader who will do anything and everything they can for the citizens. Sincerely,

What is the Electoral College? Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. The Electoral College is an unfair, outdated, and irrational process. Although many believe it is a necessity for choosing a president, it is not. I believe the process of choosing a president should be changed to the election by popular vote in the United States.

First, what is the Electoral College? In the passage ""What Is the Electoral

College"" it says, ""It is a process by which the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your President because when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors."" But, little did the fouding fathers know it is not really a compromise. The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors. Some of them unfair ones too. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. In source 2 it says, ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your President because when you vote for you r canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors.""

Second, the Electoral College is not a place, it is a process, an unfair, outdated, and irrational process. According to the passage ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" it states how, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" Do you think that is fair? This process is confusing and it should be abomished. Due to the Electoral College many people get confused and sometimes vote for the wrong canidate. In the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" it says, "" 'Faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" That is unfair, and irrational. People should be able to have a choice, although they let you feel like you're doing something by voting, you actually are not doing much. The Electoral College gets the last word.

Third, some argue that the Electoral College has good intentions, they support their claims with ideas stated in the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" some such as ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance to large states, the Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal, or the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" Although these reasons may be valid, they're not enough to pursuade thousands of U.S citizens that the Electoral College should not be abolished.

Cat got your tongue? In conclusion, as you can see the Electoral College is not always the best way to choose a president, it is unfair, it is outdated since the founding fathers had set it up, and it is irrational. the Electoral College should be replaced with the process of popular vote.                            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F76DE2A94F49,"Dear Senator,

The electoral college is in fact not best form of electing the president of the United States of America. When using the electoral college for voting for president, voters are not really voting for the president. Instead, they are voting for a slate of electors who then elect the president. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, so it is all in the hands of the chosen electors. The electors must be trusted to pick the choice that their people want, but we all know that not everyone is as trustworthy as we would like to believe. The electors could possibly vote for the party that was not wanted in the first place, which is a problem. This brings about many possible issues for the people of our country.

Having to vote for someone who then is being trusted to vote for who you would have rather voted for yourself is a huge issue. Not only could they vote for the wrong person instead of the one that you wanted, they could potentially bring the country great danger if they vote for someone who could bring about bad things to our beloved nation. The electors could always defy the will of the people.

We could save the time wasted having to vote for someone else who has the potential to vote against who we wanted to vote for by just having a direct vote for who we wanted to vote for. Having a direct vote would give the exact opinions straight from the people of the country, and there would be less arguing and hatred for who becomes the president. The whole country would be able to voice their own opinions instead of who they believe has the same opinion as them.

Having a popular vote instead of the electoral college process is a time saver, and helps the people of the country. It allows the people to vote for who they actually want directly, instead of voting for someone to then vote for the president that they want. It would give people a greater influence to vote, knowing that their own vote actually directly affects the outcome of the presidential election. It would potentially eliminate all of the electors, saving time, money, and a vote for the next president of the United States of America.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
0DBE82E9933F,"Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I believe in keeping the Electoral College for many reasons.

The Electoral College is not a place but a process that was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Each candidate running for president in a state has their own group of electors. A presidential election is held every four years so we can help choose our state's electors because when we vote for our candidate we actually are voting for our candidate's electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office.

A single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. At a very basic level, electoral college is unfair to voters. Mainly becuase of the winner-take-all system in each state. It is proven that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational but I strongly disagree. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote but it rarely happens. I have five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree.

One is Certainty of Outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Second is Everyone's President. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count and that the new president will have no regard for their interests. Third is Swing States. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election. Fourth is Big States. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Fifth is Avoid Run-off Elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. An example is Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. They both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.

These are many reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College.

On the issue of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote, I think it is both necessary and unnecessary to keep it the way even if it has been since the founding fathers established it in the Constitution many years ago. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. It only requries 270 of those votes to become the winner of the Electoral College. electorla college is good for the voting process by allowing the qulified people to vote for who they want in office. If we get rid of electoral college then we might not have as many well educated people voting for who gets put in office.

Even if we have the electoral college that dosnt always mean that we will for sure win the election. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but did not win the presidency. There are just a few things that would maybe make the electoral college a little unfair. The state voters do not directly vote for the president, they vote for the electors, who in return vote for the president. State electors are chosen by,sometimes going to state conventions ,the state's party's committee, or even sometimes the presidential canditdates themselves. So with that being said it may be unfair to vote straight for electors and just vote for the president directly. Another thing that would make it unfair because of the ""winner takes all"" system in every state candidates them selves dont spend time in the states that they are repersenting.

What happens if there is a tie in the voting of the electors? In a case like that it would go to the house of repersentatives. If we do it by popular vote than we would not have to worry about there being a tie. People would be able to vote for who they wanted and that would be settled before it even started. If you think that a tie is not likely well in 1976 a tie would have happened if just a small number of votes, 5,559 would have just voted the other way. So saying that the electorla collage way of doing it has its upsides and its down sides. It is outdated and irrational.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
99F66A238A08,"Dear State Senator,

I think we should change our voting system. Electoral College has it's flaws. We know it's the traditional voting system. It has some unfair advantages. Allow me to explain and convice you to changing our voting system.

Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors could be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors will depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't always control whom thier electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfairto voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.

I believe this is wrong because the president with the majority of vote by the U.S. should win, people should be able to decide who is president , and because I think its wrong to not give the U.S. citizens what they want.

Although electoral voting may seem good its not because you dont really vote for your president that you want your voting for a slate of elector that pick the president they would rather have .

Why ask us the people to vote when you have someone or others to chose what they think we want for president? Changing the from electoral college voting to the popular vote can give us the people a voice for what we want and think is best for this country and it gives us a reason to vote. If we still electoral college voting then our voice as a country is not being heard.

Giving us a voice in this country that we live in an enormous oppurtunity than what other countries around the world do not have the privelage to have. Giving us, the people, a voice brings us together as a country and it unifies us. It also means that not only do we have governent power but we have people power as a whole. Bradford Plumer from source 2 explains to us in his first subtitle what is wrong withe the electoral college and he startes that ""When you vote, you are not voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors, who then for the president of their choice."" That was an example of our people not having a voice because we are basically wasting our time voting because at the end of the day the slate of electors are the ones who end up chosing who they want as president. Why should we vote when our vote doesn't even matter?

Moreover, I feel that us voting is a waste of our time because of this winner-takes-all method that Bradford Plumer states in the fifth paragraph of his article titled: The Indefensible Electoral College. The winner-takes-all method is when presidents travel to specific states in which they believe they would win in the electoral votes and some states do not get visited at all by neither of the canidates because the canidates do not feel like they would win their votes. I understand that the electoral college is a process in which was founded by our founding fathers and established it into our constitution so that there is a compromise between election of the presodent by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Source 1). It is not really a compromise when you have a system in which a president can win the popular vote by 99 percent of the people but still lose by the electoral college because we basically have no say in the election.

On a final note, the electoral college system is a unfair way of our countries presidents to be elected when we also have the votes of the people which have no effect on which canidate wins. Although, our founding fathers thought this was a terrific idea at the time of making this part of the constitution, in reality we have a much larger population today than they did in the past when they had made the constitution. Having have all these people in our country vote today for a canidate and later have the vote not take any effect which canidate should win is very unfair. I can understand the electoral college system working back then when it was first made because the population was still relatively minimal but now we must abolish it because the points that some electoral vote colleges get is very small compared to some other states. How would you feel if you were a canidate and got 99.9 percent of the votes and still lost?    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

9EF555637FBC,"Dear Senator Rick Scott,

I am writing to you today in regaurds to the Electoral College and whether or not we should continue to use it in our presidential election.

As you know, the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers when they wrote the Constitutation. They established it as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and an election by popular vote of qualified citizens. I feel that we should get rid of the Electoral College and have a direct election by qualified United States citizens.

One reason that I feel the United States should get rid of the Electoral College is because Congress can be easily swayed to vote a certain way in the election. One example of this would be because of lobbying. This process is where someone persuades a person to vote a certain way by bribing them with campaign funds or other monetary things. Where some may argue that the Congress should have a say in the election because they are chosen to be leaders in their states, I feel that because of some of the people that are allowed to be elected into Congress, the United States should leave it up to the rest of the population to elect the president.

Another reason I feel this way is that through the electoral college, the population of a state votes on an elector who in turn elects the president. This is not fair because if you are a republican, you do not want the democratic president to win the popular vote. This means that if you are in a mostly democratic state, the elector for the state that you live in will most likely choose the democratic president that you voted against just because that is what some of the other people in your state wanted. This would be the same for a democrat living in a mostly republican state.

It is because of these reasons that it is in my humble opinion that the United States should get rid of the Electoral Congress and have a direct vote of qualified citizens.

It would make it a lot easer by not having to vote for one person to vote for the president. In this procces there is multiple steps to doing it and I think it is a huge hastle to go through it when you could just let the citizens decide. If you did change it this way it would cost less money and stress on the people that have to help with this long proccess.

My last reason why I think you should change the election to the most popular vote is because, it would encourage more people to vote. Right now people dont really care if they vote or not because some feel like they really have no say in it. The people would care about voting more if ther vote was going to who will the next president be this makes them want to vote. Imagine if you where a voter would you really want to go vote for somebody thats not going to be the president? If you change it and let citizens decide you will have a lot more voters.

I think you should change the election to the most popular vote is because, the citisens should have a say on who they want running the country, it would make the procces of voting for a new president a lot easer, and it will encourage more people to vote. And this is what I think you should do to better the procces    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
391455AC0C39,"The Electoral College is a really good process that I think they should keep. This Electoral college was found by the founding fathers and it is used so that the citizens could vote and the congress. The citizens get to have the right to vote on who they want to be presidant. After everyone voted the votes are counted up in each state and it shows which states voted for different people. The congress have a meeting of the electors and get to all vote. All votes for the congress are counted out seperatly then citizens. This is a the start of why I think Electoral College is fair and equal all around.

In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber. When voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors. After voting in the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment,"" which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records.

There are mainly 5 reasons in why the Electoral College should stay. First is the Certainty of Outcome which shows that there cant be a dispute because it is based on popular vote. The next reason is Everyone is Presidant, this means that the presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. Another reason is Swing Sates which is the winner take all method. They are usually whatching campaigns and really listen to the other candidates, thoses poeple are usually thoughtfull voters. The next great reason is Big States, this shows if you win a big state then you win more electoral votes and each big state has more electoral votes. The last reason is Avoid Run Off Elections, this avoids the problem of no candidates recieves a majority of the votes in the east.

Their are alot of great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings to. Voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote, they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant. This can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the 30 or so congress people voting for presidant. What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters.

After reading the article and going over it I believe that the Electoral College is a great idea. There are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it. Not everything can be perfect but the Electoral College is trying to get that way. The presidant is still getting voted every 4 years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time. Those were all my reasons on why I thought the Electoral College is the right way to go.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E5909247F839,"Dear state senator,

I ask you  to change the voting methods to popular vote instaed of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes; focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the resultof them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates al all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campain as. ""You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like Califoprnia that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the precidency and its a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slater of elctors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for precident he was not the most popular in the natuion and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the

President""  by Richard A. Posner there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting methed to The Popular voting to elect The President Of The United states Of America  because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.                           ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
65E9951C2D75,"What is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process ,not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections  of the President  by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. In the United States people select a president every three years. They would either select their president  by Electoral College, or by the most popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by elecoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to  vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes. Then ,boom you lost a vote  it might result to a tie or lost. According to paragraph 11 ""In the same vein,''faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast and deciding vote for whomeverthey please..."". You never what  could happen ,it is like taking a very riskfull risk and every votes matter .Just one vote can make a very big difference. Further more,voting by popular vote would give you a better chance of getting your candidate to win .When you are the one that elects the President you feel more confident and good .You'll know that you voted for the one you wanted to win and the one that you think that will change everything the way you wanted to. Also ,you don't have worry about anything else ,like people going in the voting box and taking the votes  out. Once you vote ,your vote is immediately safe.

In the other hand,voting by Electoral College  benefited us .Obama which is the current president of the United States wouldn't probably be president if it wasn't for them. Accordind to the last article ""In [2012's ] election ,for example ,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney....'' That means their votes helped Obama win. Also' the Electoral College avoids problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. Winners take all methods in awarding electoral votes for what they've done.

To summarise my reasonnings  Electoral College votes should be change to election by  popular vote  for the president of the United States. Peoples should be allowed to vote on their own. Everybody would be much happier .Without happy people the country would be upside down.

I feel that electoral college should stay becuase it set's straight the manege for the peoples votes for the president. Even thow if a tie the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives were they decide on the new president. The electoral college is a process its not a place. It shows that the founding fathers established it for the compromise between elections between the president by a vote in congress. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. Plus a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president .It say's in the passage that under the 23rd Amendment of the constiton that the district of colombia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purposes of electoral college. On many cases 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. The electoral college system states that voters vote not for the president,but for a state of eletors who elect the president. I think that they should have the right to elect the president that would make this nation grow stonger not to make mistakes and lead us to problems which they can decide to choose the future of the united states. Many people have diffrent opinions as me but not all will get the same results as they wanted. The effects of the electoral college has been giving us positive values. As we live on since back of the elections day we are still here becuase of thow,s elections it made us who we are american citizions of the USA.History depends on the future rights of the president thats why the electoral college is there to help make that happen.

92F0F8391870,"Having an electoral college is a controversial topic. There are many different views on whether electoral college should be allowed or removed. Keeping the Electoral College does of couse have its benefits, but so does changing to elecction by popular vote. On a personal opinion, taking out Electoral College has more positives then negatives. When taking out Electoral College, citizens of this country actually have a say in the president they choose and it will become less complicated and less confusing for voters.

Removing Electoral College and replacing it with election by popular vote is greatly convenient. Citizens in the US right now do not have a say in the president they want to win. Instead of voting for the president they are actually voting for a ""slate of electors"" according to Source 2 by Bradford Plumer. Electoral College does not represent a democracy which is what this country is all about. This country gives the individuals a right to say and express themselves. When a 4 year term is over and it is time to vote again, the citizens are voting for a group of people, not the actual president. Then, those group of people called electors later vote for the president they would like. Even though in Source 3 is states "" But each party selects a slate of electors truested to vote for the partys nominee (and that trust is barely betrayed) is is entirely possible for the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" Meaning the electoral college can still vote for another president even if it not the party's nominee. It is the electors who choose the president not the people.

Furthermore, selecting president by popular votes contains more benefits. Many people become confused when it comes to voting. They do not fully understand the concept of the Electoral College and therefore make mistakes when it comes to voting. In source 2, it clearly states "" Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" Thus meaning that people are not clear on the situation and end up making a mistake that may or may not have have changed the outcome of that election. Even though the college restores the politicaql balance between large and small states and has it's good sides to it, removing the Electoral college will be more bemeficial at the end of the day.

All in all, Electoral College should be removed and reoplaced. It will be better. Having people clear on who they vote for and actually having a say in who they want to win president will actually show this countries democratic views and will relieve probably a big chunk of Americas citizens.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
284BD4B2892B,"Dear

State Senator ,

I think the Electoral College would make voting harder. The Electoral College is unfair and votes on its own favor rather than what the people of America think. The reason is because Americans (

voters

) are not voting for their president, but for a slate of electors, who then turn and elect their president. Its a bit overruled that by declaring candidate with most popluar votes winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in the modern sense...it is electors who elect the president,not the people. The Electoral College does not let the majority of candidates votes cast making a difference in voting. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the prsident turned off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The Electoral College Method is from the past its not made for the modern day voting system, it makes voters not want to vote for there freedom or president its not made for present day voting    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5FBEBF4F7E1D,"Dear Senator of Florida,

Recently I have begun to research the difference in effect on the people of Ameirca, between the Electoral College and the result of popular cote for President. I have found out that our founding fathers created the Electoral College in the Constitution, so that while the votes between Congress and the people may be different, ther could be a compromise. Our country; well our world, is evolving with the changes in generation. 2015 has come upon us, and with this year brings a whole new change in cutural diversity and tehcnology. So while I believe sticking to our coutry's Constitution is vital for some reasons, I also believe it is outdated in others.

Today, people are slowly coming out of the shells of the past and embracing the change of the future. Every year, children grow older, new children are born, and people pass away from our fine Earth. Though this new generation we have built is going to, one day, become the generation that decides who leads our country and who doesn't. I believe that the Electoral College puts a restraint on the freedom our people, new and old, should possess. Our people have to vote for a party, a group of people that don't show either their faces or their true personalities, to trust well enough with their vote to go for the President they think is right for the Country. Although that is very rarely ever betrayed- as noted by my recent research -I do believe that it is against our certain rights as a United States citizen not to know who exactly we are putting our faith in. Also, even if we do put our full faith in these mysterious political parties, like we have for years and years, who's to say that our vote will even matter? Al Gore, in the year 2000, had more popular votes from the people than Bush, yet he received fewer electoral votes, which decided the winner of the election. Why have us put in our vote at all, if it means nothing to 538 politicians?

Our country is made up of millions, upon millions of strong women, men, and children and they should be the deciding factor in the  elections. It's our country just as much as it is the men that make up the Electoral College. A requirement of 270 electoral votes must be made in favor for one presidential candidate over the, though why should such a small number mean more against the millions from the citizens of this great country, the same people that make up the great state of Florida.

I understand the need for the Electoral College, when it comes to some decisions. Like avoiding a national catastrophe when it comes to the nuber of swing-votes. While I am a woman of passion, I do allow myself to see both sides of the story and I think while the Electoral College can do good, it can also do bad for this country. It is outdated, overused, and wrong.

Our founding fathers built the Constitution and this country we call home, and while that is a great thing...times are changing and the power of the House, and the Senate, should now be moved on to the people. Some states, like North Carolina and Rhode Island were even unable to know close to anything about the current eection between Gore and Bush in 200. I say every state deserves to know the news circling around their country and how it may affect them. The power should now be given to the people, allow them to decide and make decisions. Let the people know they are heard, they have the freedom that our founding fathers gave them in the Constitution. They can speak and let their minds roam for the good of this country.

The Electoral College should be taken down and gicen too the hands of the people, for the good of our future.

Sincerely,

A woman who cares both for her state and her country.

9EF63FBC32F7,"Dear Florida state senator,

I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I argue for keeping the Electoral College because of several reasons backed up with information.

Firstly, I'd like to point out that the Electoral College makes it so that larger states don't have larger influence than smaller states. If the Electoral College is removed then larger states shall have much more political power than smaller states. Which means that a small state might not get the same amount of attention from presidential candidates as a larger state would like Florida.

Secondly, the Electoral College avoids Run-off Elections in which no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It avoids that problem because candidates can win Presidency by electoral votes instead of popularity vote. For example, Nixon and Clinton didn't have the majority of the popular votes, but they still won because of electoral votes. If the Electoral College hadn't exist then elections might be more frustrating for everyone, because the Electoral College makes a certainty of outcome.

Thirdly, the Electoral College makes sure that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. This is good because a candidate with only regional appeal is probably not going to be a very good president. And besides without the Electoral College there would be many presidents with regional appeal wich would make other states feel left out, and this could be catastrophic to the unity of America.

In conlcusion, despite the Electoral College isn't exactly of democratic origins, it still equalizes the political power of states, makes sure that candidates have trans-regional appeal and avoids run-off elections. Overall I say that the Electoral College is very important in keeping how we choose our president balanced and smooth.                                                                                            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F37464EF4C66,"What is The Electoral College? It is a process the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified cirizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors. Most states use a ''winner-take-all'' method that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The Electoral College is the method we use for voting and selecting our president's.

Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Therefore I think that we should change to a popular vote. Over 50 percent of the people agreee, and I think that should be enough proof. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.

The problem with the electoral college is that you voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, wwho in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate. The slate containing 34 Democratic electors pleged to Kerry. Most likely those voters would probably win the election because Texas is a big state and a high percentage of the people voted Kerry.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Just as Romney was a solid regional in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states. This causes the method to be difficult to chose a for sure winner. Usually elections are always close.

The Electoral College restores some of that weight in the pollitical balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The method may turn off potential voters. Especially for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California. I think that we should changeb to a popular vote method. Either way, people should be encouraged to vote because every vote counts.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
9562D07129D8,"THere has been quite a lot of recent talk of which the national government should keep the Electoral COllege, or change to an election by popular vote for the president of the UNited states. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress""(Source 1: What is the Electoral College? by the office of the federal register). IT has been established by the founding fathers to make a compromise between popular vote and election vote in congress. Popular representation is a vote for qualified citizens to take an individual vote cast to the state which then is transfered to a representative whole. Thre are many good effects this popular representation has on the country, but the Denator should keep the Electoral College without a shout of a doubt.

one of the most important reasons we should keep the electoral college process is that in this process, states pay much more attention to the electors due to having swing states. the people who decide on our president should be most intrigued and the most concerning ones. ""Voteres in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competeing candidates- knwing htat theu are going to decide the election(in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president, by richard a. posner, subtitle Swing States)"".  MAny voters that are in swing states, which are stated that cast the majority of votes in the system with higher amounts of population, therefore congress representatives.

another reason why the gov shouyld keep the elctoral college is because  it resorts unwanted balance.  ""there is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidtate wins a mojority of the votes casy; that pressuire mwhich would greatly cvomplicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner"" so what this quote from the passage is saying is that no candidate recieves a majority if the votes cast, due to each states fair rep of the population without being overwhlemded by the most populated states such as florida, california, and trexas. While you may believe that the popular representaion vote may be overwhelmingkly more accurate to the people wants , you are wrong. the electoral college is a processs in whic hgives the people wants in a state to an elector who then gives yiou an equal chance onf voting for what youo pleased. he may be the ""biggest"" or ""smallest"" amount of electoral votes, but as a state in a whole yu may recieve a big surprise that there is no clear winner as each [president may not be just familiat with one region such as the north east, or the southwest, etc.

so as you can see, the government should keep an electoral colllge process instead of the popular representation vote. it would be greatly appreciated to the United States People who may be under informed of how grest an oppurtunity for an idea such as this to vome up, or they might be over informed of fallicy iinformatio  of our election process now. either way, theyu should know what a great process this is    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The government has made two types of ways to vote, Electoral College and popular vote. I believe that we should go with the popular vote method. When voting like this its not a confusing, Theres no missing ad campaigns, and in the winner take all you dont rule out another persons elector for his chose.

Using popular vote for electing our president is better then Electoral College i believe because its not that confusing. In Electoral College you vote for a wet number of electors and they give their own vote on their behalf. Now with popular vote say one state votes for president b rather then president a then the state votes for president b.

In ppular vote both presidents are trying to win you over so they will make a campaign. what if you never see the campaign? This is what can happen in the Electoral College method. If a president knows that a certain state will not vote for them then the president wont perade around there. Therefore the state cant make a correct decision.

The popular vote method is very diffrent as you have seen in the paragraphs above. One reason I prefer the popular vote method over the Electoral College is do to the winner take all in ruling out the electors that didnt vote for the president. So if theopposing pesident winns the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and i dont believe thats fair.

So when it comes to election day which method will you chose?

ED46683FC1E4,"The Electoral College is a place. In the passage, they are deciding wether or not to abolish the Electoral College. It was originally made as a compromise in the election process for a new president.

Based on the information given in this passage, the Electoral College should be kept. It makes it easier to decide on a new president. The normal citizens vote for who they want, then those vote go to the electors. Those electors then vote for who they think should be president. If the Electoral College is abolished, then it would become way more diificult to decide on a new president .

Although over sixty percent of citizens want a direct vote, it still has its upsides. For example, the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. Each state selects a group of their own voters to decide on the next president. Using the Electoral College, this is a certainty of outcome. The winner-take-all method froces candidates to focus on not only the large states, but also the smaller ones. The Electoral College also helps to avoid run-off elections.

A7EA8CF2F203,"In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1) I believe strongly that we should keep the electoral college, beacuse it keeps people from directly voting for a presdient,keeps everything even and mostlikely fair. Most people think that we should get rid of the electoral college,its clearly a state of opinion.

When you really sit down and think about how most people vote in the Northeast and South they are not the thoughtful voters. (said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what he  stood for but most didn't.

In reality most people think that the voting is unfair, like what happened with Presidnet Kennedy. Kennedy was the stronger, better canidate to be president. I believe that the electors chose right, it may not have been who the people wanted. He was way better then Nixon could ever be. That may have made the people very mad,which led to the assination of President Kennedy. Kenndey changed the country and to this day in my mind, known as one of the best presdidents we ever had. Thanks to the electoral system we had Kennedy elected instead of Nixon,could you just imagine how the country would be today. If Kennedy didnt win,or if Nixon was president just one little thing could change everything. Everything happens for a reason and having the electoral college helps. I know that Nixon has the popular vote but kennedy needed to win for the better of our country,its my state of opinion.

Most people think that having the electoral college is bad,why? because they believe that the people should be able to vote directly. I understand how and why they believe that. When you think about votin directly it would insure the people that whoever they are voting for they would be sure to get thier votes and for sure get the president that they wished to be president. I could truley undertsand why and this would work out, but i still strongly believe that this could be the cause to many problems.

In conclusion,I beleive that we shoudl keep the electoral college becaue he keeps the people for choosing a president direlcetly. If they make a bad chose someone,who knows is the better canidate that they could over rule the peoples vote. So it would all fair in most turns and would possibably helping the country,and many people believe otherwise its truely a state of opinion. You choose who chooses the president.

To begin with, you've probably herd the term democracy since thats what our government is  right ? well that word comes from the latin words demo & kratia meaning people rule . Popular vote would be better than the electoral college because then peoples voices can truly be heard, no scams, no funny buisness, just old fashion voting. Popular vote is also an easier and much more simple system than the electoral college. with popular vote all you do is look at the polls and see who has more votes as apposed to counting each and every states electoral points until you get 273.

In addition, if popular vote is put into action then it would inspire more people to vote, some citizens are very skeptical about the electoral collage but with popular vote the facts are in the polls. According to "" The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer The electoral college is infair, outdated, and irrational.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 ""Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency.""  If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a one-sided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well.    ",6,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F74C46C14E72,"Dear State Senator,

I understand there has been some contreversy between keeping or changing the Electoral College by popular vote for the president of the United States, But We need to Keep the Electoral College, and these are the reasons why.

First things first, the Electoral College is a process,not a place. Also it consists of 538 electors but a majority of electoral votes needs to be 270 votes in order to elect a president. So each Canident has a 50/50 chance of winning or losing. The elctors are chosen by the political parties, which i can see how people would have a problem with that,but if they dodnt choose the canadents for us we probably would even know which person to elect as a canadent.

The presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, giving the citizens more than enough time to decide if they are happy with the president they have or if they should elect a new one, usually there happy with the president they elected which means that the Electoral College process is working.

Although the electorla college system is for the voters to vote for a slate of electors to elect the president the citizens still get a say in the election towards there president of choice. if the citizens could just elect a president from there personal votes then they would probably make the wrong decsion on who to choose, they might be fooled by the flashy ads on tv promising change when in reality, there promises are lies. Thats why having a slate of electors help to vote for a president if so important because they know how to point out there lies and know what there true intentions are.

Some say that the Electoral College system is 'Unfair' to the people but i strongly disagree. Infact, the Electoral College helper the people choose the right president for our country    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
CCF1C548FD56,"One big thing i want to happen is that the electoral college for voting should be changed for popular vote for the prsident because i think that if you change it voting would go a lot easier than it do now. Why? because the electoral college is a more complicated voting matter that people often do and get their votes mixed up and  it takes more effort and time just to vote rather than a easy popular vote that people can measure off a chart or graph to see with person should get elected.

Another thing about the voting process i think i shoul'd talk about is some of the possible problems you can come across after this change in the voting process. there's one thing thats possible of happening is that a lot of people might nor agree with changing the voting process because they dont want to learn a new one because they are so used to the one they already doing. Another one is that poeple might think things would go more worse if someone mad a change because of they way the votes are coming in and if you voting on a behalf of a friend and send the vote to the wrong person and the other person lost by 1 vote when you didn't mean to send that, they should have a computer system that you use that makes sure you really want to vote on that person.

It is another major thing about voting that needs to be discuss. when all these thousands of people vote they votes should actually count not just have people vote and then the only votes that count is the people in some court room that have more business people come in to vote and only there's count. But i think people waist a lot of their time with the electoral college because of how it works and the way peopple send their votes and who the votes actually going to.

The winner of the election is the most important one because he is the main focu now because his votes were more popular of just alot more than the other person, but thats what i want to talk about. even though the winner won he still have to pay attention to the other candidates but they should have a system that protects the winner files and have people haves a good watch on the people who is elected to see what their background life is like their history and what they do everyday to make sure that person isn't trying no horrible plan for something.

23F6EB35E138,"The Electoral College is a process in which electors pick the president instead of the people, but is it worth keeping. No, the Electoral College is not worth keeping because it reflects the view of the electors instead of  the people.

Some people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certaintity of the outcome ( source 3 paragoh 18). However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win (source 3 paragraph 19). This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the canditate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory. In all the Electoral College should be abolished becasue it takes away say of the people.

Not only does the Electoral college take away the say of the people, it also has no protection against a tie of states that have an even number of electors (source 2 paragraph 11). For instance a state like hawaii that has a total of two electors if they both vote for differnt people then how are the votes decided well it already happened in 1960,but Richard Nixon who was the vice president at the time and known to be against the Electoral College decided to only aknowledge his opponents electors. That is why we should abolish the Electoral College.

Allow me ask a hypothetical question what if the electors were corrupt and voted for whomever they pleased without even considring the peoples vote (source 1 paragrqaph 2). We have no system to ensure that the people vote matters but the electors does therefore electors that are picked by former canditates may be more likely to return the favor and ignore the peoples vote and vote for their canditate. There are many important figures whom are against the Electoral College such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter,  and Bob Dale there are many more but thes are all politicians who see the Electoral College the same way the people do (source 2 paragraph).

In all the Electoral college should be abolished because it ignores the peoples votes. The votes that werre granted to the people by the constitution therefore the Electoral College not only doesn't care about the people, but it is also violating their constitutional rights.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
850201A9689E,"The electoral college is our countries way of voting, but we need to change that and what i mean by that is that i think we need to have our voting system on the peoples popular vote, for many reasons first off, easy to comprehend you dont have to be nervous and accedently vote on someone different you can obviously see who your voting on. secondly, president can win just by popular vote and not worry about the electoral college votes.

To start off, the electoral college is confusing when i first learned about it i could barely understand, but when your voting on a president you dont have to worry about voting on the wrong person because you vote and your states vote is different. also when you vote by poular vote you chboose who you want to be president and not worrying about your states vote. also theyr'e aren't any hassels involved like understanding how the electoral college works. also the vote that you cast can not be who you wanted due to the elctoral college because you cast a vote on the electors and they vote which isn't fair to the people because they could vote for someone toltally different then what you wanted.

In addition, the nominees for president now can get popular vote and still loose which isn't fair to the people and the nominee because he can get tricked and the people do to which is cruel. also if if i was a nominee i would wrather win by a popular vote becacuse it means the people get to vote for who they wanted instead of a elector and it means the people really wanted me as a president so it shows that they wanted me and that i win by there election vote. now instead of that we have a system to where i could be running and get popular vote and loose which is cruel and unright to the people cause it means they wanted me.

To conclude, the elctoral college is our countries way of voting but i would wrather have the president win by popular vote because first, easy to comprehend and you get who you wanted to vote for. secondly, you dont have to worry about winning popular vote then loose cause you didn't win electoral vote.         ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
1F8ECF8C118D,if i had to choose i would change to election vote  cause it is more popular and it has less problems unlike the other  cause when you do electoral college you have to do lots ofdifferent things that is not worth doing which is a disaster for some people and while other people are saying how good the electoral college is if its so good why do you so many issues with things that happen to people thats what i dont understand they dont let some people vote cause there age which is stupid they should  let them vote thats the reason why ther areso many disputes in the world cause of the ignorance of some people and the only thing the people from electoral college is worried about iswinning instead of carring for the other people which is not right that is the reason so many outbreaks happen cause people start to not even give a crap about the people that is wanting to vote but the people is not worriedtwo cents about what anyone else thinks their just worried bout  themselves which is stupid and they should have been done something about this before it get to much out of control which is leading to much more problems it needs to come to a end and pick a president who would actually give a care about the people of the united states  instead them going around and talking about them in different ways that is not needed cause only a majority of people votes for him doesnt mean that he or she has to be a complete jerk to them and start talking bout them in bad ways that is how many fights start and when they start they dont ever stop talking bout it for a long period of time which pisses people off what if someone started talking bout you or your parents you would want to beat the crap out of them then there would be catastrophic failure which leadsto more and more drama which just makes things even worse nominees get happy that they won the vote and start getting all crazy and start saying things just to get people all ticked off and things that really didnt meanto happen happens to people that did not even do anything to hurt that person at all which is messed up cause they dont give no effort to even say they are sorry for what they did to that person the advocates that are in the position they say things that make arguements and other things that dont need to happen begin which doesnt make things any easier it just causes more drama that doesnt need to happen cause even more trouble that is not a good thing to have happen when that happens it just has bad things happening everywhere and it only makes things worse which leads to cause even more drama in peoples life and it doesnt seem fun getting out of all that drama that happened    ,1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
04DEFB0B11C5,"The united states has this ellection system called the electoral collage. The electoral collage is a system of voting for verious comities. When the founding fathers of The united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it.

Why would any one want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. In my oppinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government. Over the years there has been a larg number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in todays tecnology. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage.

The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a ""winner-take -all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat.

Everything that is rong with the electoral collage. Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.    ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
