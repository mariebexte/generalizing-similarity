64A4EBA4CC37,"Some schools allow students to complete classes online or through video conferencing from home as an alternative to being on campus. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because this leaves optimal room for cheating, this could cause students to lack social skills, and this is an open opportunity for procrastination.

Having access to a computer or a cell phone is an advantage in the new technology-based generation. However, this leaves a place for dishonesty in work when used for in-home learning. Using the internet, you can access absolutely any information with a few clicks or taps. Websites such as 'Brainly' and 'Quizlet' are used by students seeking answers; they type in a question from their work and every answer for all of the questions is right there in their hand. With cheating instead of actually learning and retaining knowledge, students will fall behind in the real world. In a classroom, most likely you will find that cell phone use is prohibited due to the fact that students don't use their phones for learning purposes. When students are guided by teachers instead of given the answers by computer, they are more likely to remember the information later in life.

Students who work from home are not around their fellow classmates. Being isolated from people is one way children and teens can lack social skills that they will most likely need now or as an adult. In a classroom, you are surrounded by other people your age, and you all can learn from each other. Classrooms are one of the first places where you learn how to communicate and collaborate with others. These are only a few of the social skills you could lack from being alone every single day. These skills are needed for getting jobs when you are older and for many other opportunities in life.

Working from home is a plus for getting to sleep in every day and being allowed to work at your own pace, but some students could take advantage of this and procrastinate. As i stated before, in this technology-based generation, a cell phone is a good thing to have. However, that could also serve as a distraction. Instead of being in the classroom where students are required by their teacher to complete tasks daily, they are in the comfort of their own home free to do what they want to do. Watching television, talking on the phone, skipping work days, and oversleeping can all lead to falling behind in work and receiving failing grades. When you have a teacher pushing you to complete each task when it is assigned, you are more than likely to complete all tasks given to you on time. This way, you will keep up your grades while also learning a sense of responsibility.

In conclusion, students would benefit more from learning in a classroom than they would from working at home. They won't be able to cheat on their work as easily as they could from home, they will have good communication skills from being surrounded by their fellow classmates, and they are less likely to procrastinate their assignments.",4,Distance learning,Independent
C5EFBFA0F25E,"Over 25% of students struggle to focus and learn in public schools. Most public schools can be beneficial in some ways that can help students. There is another option if you don't want to attend a school you can take online courses which help keep people that are not able to go to school. Most students go to a public school and do not take the online classes because they were raised that way. The reasons why online classes are beneficial because students can get one on one help with many different teachers and they can fix the classes to their schedule.

One reason online courses are beneficial is because students can get one on one help for a variety of courses if needed. Some students struggle and they don't know what to do first or they don't remember how to do it. Most students have trouble remembering how to start but if they do online courses they can video call a teacher for help or advice. Sometimes students need a recap of the lessons that they did on previous courses. On online classes they teachers that are on their for almost the whole day and students can contact them whenever needed. The students can ask for help at almost any time they want and teachers will be prepared and waiting to provide one on one help with students. Most students can't contact a teacher when they need help and are in normal classes that's why online courses are more beneficial to the students.

Secondly, students can adjust classes to their schedule depending on the amount of time they have. Sometimes students have trouble trying to schedule their activities and sometimes school gets in the way of those activities. Students that have that trouble can schedule their courses depending on what time they have available. Online classes dont take very long to complete and can be easily fit into a busy schedule. Students can do the classes on any device which allows them to do it anywhere at any time. Students can do online classes at any time frame that they are available at. Their classes start and finish time revolve around the time frame that they set themselves.

On the other hand parents still think that it is healthy to let their children go to schools that have those bad environments. Most of the parents say that it helps them be more social and keeps them from staying in the house too often. The solution to this long going problem ,of taking physical classes with crowded class rooms and many distractions, is to let their children take online courses. Many of the students that take online courses have had problem with public schools like crowded rooms or big class sizes. Students have trouble focusing in classes that have larger number in it. The students mind has difficulty focusing because of all of the ca-motion that is in the room.

In conclusion online courses benefit the students a lot more than the average classroom does.

Many students that take online classes have higher scores than normal students because online classes provide more help. Most students that are in normal classes struggle because they don't have one on one help. The many students that have online courses are more happy and have more free time than normal students. Students prefer online classes because it revolves around their schedule and they can get one on one help with work.",5,Distance learning,Independent
CA4E39042770,"I agree with that, because some student's would not come to the school, this a huge opportunity for us, we have some reasons to take classes in online because we missing to much classes for us graduation, and it's easy organize our own time. It's important to study because all of us, want to be a professional.

In some cases the student's prefer to come at the school, but I believe that for mejority of us, is preferable to take classes in online, because we don't have troubles with anyone and we can do the classes in anytime.

For example; Many of students had job, and they have to work sometimes in the night also in the day, but they make an effort to complete their study. I am working really hard in my classes, and manytimes is very stressful. I want to take the advanced diploma, but I miss one class, so here I have the opportunity to take in online. In my opinion these is really important for us because is a help to continue a life less stressful. Something that I like is to pass time with my family and share with they, but I don't have time because I have to come at the school and I get to many tasks, exchange if we take classes in online we can do many things.

In addition; is good to come at the school but for the senior students is more preferable to take classes in online beause we begin to work in restaurants or another places. I want to have this experience of not coming at the school and take my classes in online and I want to learn new things to develop my abilities. It's a good idea to know that we have more options to take classes when we take classes from home we have the advantage to sleep more. Students would benefit in this way because we want to do different things and not come to the school almost all day. For example: I want to travel but i can't because I have to come at the school.",3,Distance learning,Independent
632998A6072F,"What would make the students feel about attending classes from home, instead of school? Students attending to class everyday early in the morning can be stressful. Especially if students don't normally attend; their attendance can effect their grades. They will not learn from anything by the distractions that are going around in public schools. It is best for students to stay focused and concentrated to be successful. Otherwise they will not learn the education they need.

Homeschooled can be the best option for students. The reason why, is because there isn't a schedule to follow. The main important reason about home school is that the students will stay concentrated and should complete all assignments in a less distracting environment. Students will not have to stress over load of work because there will be plenty of time to be able to complete them. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers.

Students complains about having to do homework for one night and not having enough time to complete them. Homeschooling will allow students to work on their own pace. Students sit on a desk for 6-7 hours everyday. They have limited of time for eating and using the bathroom. It will make the students feel pressured about the rules. Such as how to properly dress for example. Homeschool doesn't have any rules to worry about other than students getting their studies.

Public schools can be very difficult to handle as a student. There are bullying, physical fights, accidents may occur, and also on lock down that isn't a drill can be very dangerous. Students should go to school just for the education and have to not worry about any problems. Students should feel safe at a public school. Homeschool should be the safest environment without any worries or problems.

Homeschool is for the benefit of students to pass all of their exams and to also have good grades. Students are staying on task on every assignment that counts. Students should feel comfortable without any rules involved. Public schools and home school are similar, but home school is nothing but getting your education. Home school should be the best option for students.",4,Distance learning,Independent
38B237B2F190,"In the current era, you never have to step foot in a public school ever again. Yes, you are still lawfully required to complete the majority of your secondary education, but the ever growing access to laptops and other electronic devices has introduced a new method for students to earn their highschool diplomas. Some school districts now permit their students to learn and participate in class via internet or video conference. While this innovation may seem like a peek into the future of American schools, it is not without its share of faults. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in typically absent-causing.

After every school year, students are expected to show mastery of the cirriculums in each of their core classes. What the final exams fail to measure, however, are the other critical life skills that students obtain in the classroom. For example, group projects do more for the individual than teach them a bunch of facts and figures. They also simulate the level of collaboration students will use regularly as future members of the workforce. Similarly, assigning nightly homework goes deeper than the teacher's desire to keep their pupils busy, as learning to balance piles of graded assignments is an effective way to teach lessons about time management. Taking online classes will enact these same skills to an extent, though the lack of classmates combined with a more flexible schedule puts students in a bit of a bubble. In other words, school becomes less about practical application and focuses significantly more on pure academic knowledge. While online classes accomplish the same goal in their cirriculums, they fall terribly short in teaching students other important life skills.

social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to ""quiet down"" and ""focus on their assignments"", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers. Online classes, with their isolated environment, cause students to lack the same interaction and attention they recieve at school everyday.

Of course, schools would not offer their students online classes if it came with zero benefits. There is a strong arguement to be made in favor of virtual schooling when students are abesent for an extended period of time. When faced with extreme situations, like severe illness or family emergencies, students must also stress over catching up on their work upon returning to school. Online classes would allow these students to complete assignments and learn course material outside of the classroom. Nonetheless, this peace of mind is only applicable if the student is mentally and/or physically capable to do schoolwork while enduring such a taxing hardship. Online classes may come in handy when students would usually miss school, even the pros are of this school system are laced with cons.

The debate of online classes in place of traditional schooling is a complicated one. Allowing students to complete their academic career without actually attending school may help keep them on track, as they could continue to learn in situations that would otherwise require an absence, but at what price? Online classes cause students to miss out on important life lessons and practical skills, such as collaboration and time management, due the the structure of the assignments. Additionally, students will have less opportunites to interact with their peers and create long-lasting memories at school-sponsered events. For now, it is in the best interest of the children and the future society to keep students in the classroom. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in absent-causing situations. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
BA930ABE4928,"Online school has become more and more popular in the past years, which is possible today due to the evolving technology. Teachers upload the material and video chat with the students to teach, and the students submit their finished work for the teacher to grade. This seems like a great way for students to learn at their own speed and to attend school even though you might not have a way to get to school.

Every student has their own learning speed and way that they learn best. I usually understand things pretty fast and do not have a lot of trouble learning at a fast pace, many other students need more time to understand a topic and more explanation. When in a class room there is only a limited amount of time to ask questions or for the teacher to explain again. Every student also has their preferred way of learning. Some keep most information when they write it down over and over again, some are more visual and need graphs or pictures, and others have to try ore build things to learn. This amount of individuality is often not possible if you are in a class room with twenty-five other students.

When I was in eight grade we learned about Australia in English class, and how the kids who live in he middle of the outback use online school and video chatting to do their school work. Australia is not the only place where that would be handy; students here in the US live very rural sometimes too and take a very long time to get to school. If they could do their school work online they would not have to go through the trouble and could to their work from home. This would also come in handy if you have a severe illness or injury and it is impossible for you to attend school for an extended amount of time. The student could do their homework from home or a hospital and not miss months of classes and possibly have to redo the entire year.

However this is not a fit for everyone. Some need more help and assistance that can not be provided through a screen but has to be done in person. I like having the opportunity to talk to my classmates about the topic or ask questions directly to the teacher. I find it easier to understand, especially difficult topics, when they are explained to me face-to-face.

Online school may not be something for everybody and I believe that everyone should decide for themselves personally if this would be something for them. I prefer going to school and learning in a class room because I get easily distracted and would not actually learn anything if I was at home. Today, it is almost impossible to not use any kind of media and technology in your day to day life and it makes learning a lot easier. We have to find a middle point between not using at all and too much.",5,Distance learning,Independent
E39559BF14F2,"My step sister, Generic_Name, use to do online classes from our home because she suffers from a physical illness that doesn't allow her body to produce enough blood cells. Because my step sisters body does't produce enough blood cells this effects her body to get tired very quickly. Generic_Name can't stand up for long amounts of time and can't preform as much physical activity as others. When Generic_Name preforms too much physical activity, that her body cant obtain, she will get very light-headed and feel as if she's going unconscious. If Generic_Name puts her body at too much physical risk, she could possibly have a seizure. Online classes were very beneficial for my step sister, Generic_Name, because it allowed her to be at rest when learning. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is a very beneficial to those who suffer any kind of mental or physical illness and to those who have a busy schedule. Although, others believe the youth is too irresponsible to hold themselves accountable for such a tremendous responsibility, and is not beneficial for students.

The opportunity for students to attend online classes or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who suffer any sort of mental or physical illness. Both mental and physical illnesses come with a unique everyday battle, for the individuals who suffer from them. Some students suffer from mental illness's like: PTSD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. When a student suffers from a mental illness and attends a public school it can be extremely difficult to cope. Depression is a mental illness that affects someones thoughts and feelings to occur as more negative. In some cases, depression can affect someone physically. Someone who suffers from depression and attends a public school can face daily difficulties, like, getting out of bed in the morning for school and participating in class. When I was in the eighth grade, I had to transfer out of my public school, Generic_School. I transferred out of Generic_School and instead received my eighth grade education through online classes. I took online classes from home. Attending Generic_School was a difficult responsibility for me at the time because I was in a very depressive state of mind. When taking online classes and being home schooled, I had plenty of extra time to slowly pull myself out of the depressive mindset that I was suffering from. I pulled myself out of this depressive mindset, by using my extra time going to therapy and receiving medication to improve the negative thoughts and feelings that I had towards myself and life. Online classes benefited me because I learned all of the eighth grade circular that I needed to at a pace that was comfortable for me and my mental health at the time.

Students who take classes online or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who have a busier schedule. Some children have busier and more complicated lives compared to others. For example, some children are raised in households that their parent guardian struggles financially. When a child is raised into a financially struggling household, he or she will busy themselves by working a full-time job. A child who is raised into a household like this will work full-time because they will do anything it takes for them to be financially stable on their own in their future. A child who works a full-time job, typically doesn't have enough time out of his or hers day to attend a public school. But, he or she will have the opportunity of having extra time to prepare themselves for their future. In a hypothetical situation like this, online classes and video conferencing from home would be very beneficial to students who are born into households were they have no choice but to busy themselves and to be an independent because they can't be dependent on their parent guardian.

Although, others believe that distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing is not beneficial. Others believe that distance learning wouldn't be beneficial for students because the youth is too irresponsible of holding themselves accountable for having such a tremendous responsibility. My freshmen year, I had a very close friend, Generic_Name, Generic_Name was a trouble maker at school. Because Generic_Name was a trouble maker at school, her parents thought that public school was not the best place for her to receive an education. Therefore, Generic_Name took online classes at home. Online classes tend to be a very tedious and a independent responsibility that requires a ton of focus and self-control. Generic_Name did not have these qualities. Because Generic_Name took online classes from home and obtained the qualities of having no focus and no self control, she did not take her online classes as seriously as she needed to. During the times that Generic_Name was supposed to be focused with her online circular, she was more focused on boys and going out to parties. Distance learning was not beneficial to Generic_Name because she was too irresponsible to have such a tremendous responsibility that she was supposed to hold her accountable for.

In conclusion, depending on who and how someones personal life is, distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. This can be tremendously beneficial to those who suffer from any kind of mental or physical illness and those who have a busy schedule.",5,Distance learning,Independent
6BDFC792D2D4,"Research shows that students work better at home compared to going to school five days out of the week. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home rather than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one time with their teacher.

To start off, attending classes at home will relive students of stress. Many students go to school with bullies and many unkind people, the aftermath of this it that many students suffer from stress and anxiety. Stress and anxiety are not good for human beings physically, mentally, and emotionally. Therefore we should take it very seriously especially for the students trying there hardest to receive a good education. For instance there are multiple bullies in school that enjoy picking with others, this causes students to be fearful of going to class. Being bullied is a big burden to bare. This will cause many students to not willingly attend school in fear of being bullied. Also school can be very hard and challenging. While your at home their is a higher possibility of being more relaxed and calm, rather than at school it can be very hectic and judging. Home is somewhere and you can relax in a quiet peaceful area while you are doing your schoolwork. Taking classes at home will allow students to stay away from all the hate and negativity.

Furthermore, attending classes at home will allow students to be able to focus and concentrate more efficiently. Many students complain of their classmates being goofy or disruptive, students in the hall making noises and being to loud, and even fights and arguments within the class rooms are a major interruption. If students had classes at home it would be so much easier for them to focus in a calm and quiet area. For an example, Many teachers say that multiple people in there classes find it hard to focus due to class clowns, students acting out, hallway disruptions, and being distracted by doing things that were not instructed by the teachers. Also many students found it very challenging to focus on what they needed to when all they heard was ruckus. A result of not being able to pay attention, many students tend to fail or not make the grades needed to pass the class or even the grade. Many parents would consider having their children attend their classes at home so there children can be successful. In order of passing your will have to be able to pay attention which is very hard in a class full of students.

Lastly, it allows students to have more one on one time with there teachers. In a class full of students, it can be very hard trying to assist every students with all there wants and needs. Also there are many students that are confused on what they are learning because the lack of help and attention they are receiving. For example, a students once said at one point she was clueless on what she was doing. This was because the teacher was never able to get with her and work through the problems due to the teacher trying to satisfy everyone else needs. This is a problem because every now and then students need individual help and it is hard to receive that help when others need it as well. This can all be resolved by letting students attend classes at home. This will allow students to receive the one on one help they need with their teacher. The teacher will be able to walk through with the student step by step and teach them the way needed.

In conclusion, Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home rather than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one time with their teacher. Attending classes at home will benifit studnets in many ways.                   ",5,Distance learning,Independent
59A5BE420CB6,"Many schools have already adapted to Google classroom and online education helpers to help students keep up to date with their work. It is important for students to be able to keep up with classes if they are absent from school. Especially for high school students, missing one day of class could put a student far behind on classwork and new material. Distance learning should be taken seriously for students who do not have the option of attending school. With distance learning, it would be beneficial for students who are sick, help maintain grades, and help teachers have students understand the material without having to pull the student aside.

Catching the flu or common cold is normal for students in school. They can not help catching it. Staying at home and not being able to attend school is not something many high school students would want, knowing they have their GPA to worry about. There are also students who are terminally ill and have to be at the hospital for weeks to months. Students who are in the hospital, sometimes have to repeat a grade due to missing too much classwork and not being able to keep up with their classes. Having the option of distance learning would benefit students like this at home or somewhere else. They would be able to understand the work and new material if they can video conference and access classwork online. It would also benefit the school, having students still learn even if they are at home.

High school students have to worry about their GPA in order to get into college. One day of missing class could push a student far behind his or her classmates. Many schools across the United States have been using Google class for students to keep up their work and to remember to do homework. More and more schools are assigning laptops to students, so they can all connect with teachers and classmates about projects, homework, or questions. It is considered distance learning if a student could connect to it outside of school. Besides Google classroom, online lessons could help absent students maintain their grades. It is a shame for students to not be able to understand the things they missed due to health reasons or family emergencies. If more students can maintain their grades through distance learning, that would benefit the school as well when it comes to education ranking. If more students have higher grades due to keeping up with missed classwork when they are absent, it would help the school gain a better status as well.

Video conferencing a class or teacher while absent would benefit both teacher and student. Normally, students would have to stay after school or before in order to learn the material they missed. This takes time away from the teacher and student. It is a teacher's job to help every individual student if they ask for it. But both student and teacher could have conflicting schedules or have after school activities to attend to like sports. If a student could video conference a class from home, he or she could be able to learn with the class instead of falling behind and asking their peers to help them. For teachers, that could help the teacher have all of his or her students understand the material together, instead of having to take time away from his or her day to re-teach a lesson.

Overall, distance learning could excelled further on in the future. More students and teachers could sync together when it comes to learning missed classwork and lessons. Education is a must in the United States. And using distance learning even more could help more students nationwide, and benefit their academics. The future could be bright if distance learning could be incorporated into the education system more than it has been.",5,Distance learning,Independent
4C9D310A1516,"As a person who loves to stay home, I can say they would not benefit off of this method of learning, some students may, but most would not. If students were taught at home they'd be able to goof around because they have free will and no teacher to tell them what to do, they'd be less focused because they have more distractions because they're at home with all the things they like. When taking a test it would just make cheating easier as the teacher may not be able to see the student. On the plus side there would be less arguing because if you get upset with the teacher you just mute them and turn off the camera, but then again that's another reason not to do this.

I think the only reason to do this would be if the student was sick, out of the country, or injured severely. How much sleep would the studen get when they are out of the country, because of the different time zone? Good part is they may get a better education doing this than in their own country, it prvoides students new opportunitys to learn more about themselves and the world, yet it's a terrible idea what happens when the connection is bad and the stundet doesn't know what's going on, then they're lost on evrything.

A2CD2CBF5A87,"Students would not benefit from taking online classes from home. In a classroom setting it is easier to focus on the work a person is trying to get done, someone is there to tell you to get your work done, and it is a social skill aid. Some examples of this are that I find it hard to focus on my own, in the book

Throne of Glass the main character Celena is moved from a situation she is familiar with and is distracted by all of the new things, and I have become less shy because of the friends I have made.

It is easier to focus on the work given to a person. In the book

Throne of Glass the main character Celena Sardothien was in a place called Endovier, early on in the book she was removed from that place and moved to a castle. On the way she became very distracted by the things around her and not her task at hand. She needed constant reminders of where she was going and what she needed to do. Once she was reminded she would remember for a day and then the next she would forget. In order for students not to be in the same predicament they need to be in a classroom setting where thy can focus on the work at hand because everyone is working on the same thing.

Someone is there to keep a person on track. In my life I find it hard to focus on a task at hand if I am uninterested in it and tend to procrastinate. In order for me to stay on task I need someone to remind me to do my work. When I am given a project that I have no drive to complete I procrastinate until I can't anymore, some teachers remind their student s that there is a project due and that they need to finish it. When I am in those classes I tend to do the best because I am always on top of my work. There have been projects where I forget about them until the last day and then I start to work on them, most of the time I am not proud of the work that I do on those projects. So other students don't end up in the situations I have by procrastinating they should stay in a classroom so they always know when something is due.

Being in a classroom is a social skill aid. Over the years I have been in public school I have become less shy due to the amount of interaction that I must do to complete certain tasks, such as, group projects. Through those experiences I have made many friends, I even have some friends that I have known since first grade. Through these friends I have come out of my shell and I have become more confident. Through my friends I have learned that it is ok to be weird and that they will support me through any tough times. There have been situations where I have needed to help my friends interact with people and I have used the social skills that I learned in school through dealing with mean and rude teachers and in some cases rude students. Students should stay in a public classroom setting because of the valuable social skills thy will learn there that will help them out in their lives.

Students should be in a public classroom setting to develop their social skills and get reminded about the work that they need to focus on. Some may disagree with this statement but they have not thought about all of the experiences that kids would be missing out on if they took online classes. Students should not take their online classes from home.",4,Distance learning,Independent
74CC1D0FE728,"Schools around the globe have been offering distance learning classes as an option. Students would take classes at home by video calls with teachers. There is a lot of talk of whether distance learning is a good or bad idea for students. There are many pros and cons to this idea and for that, it is hard to tell. Students feel more comfortable in their own home and lessen stress. Though, students need social interaction and routine in their teen years; therefore, it is not the greatest idea.

While this idea sounds good in the first place and lots of students might want to take distance learning over going to school, it offers no social interaction to students. Social interaction with peers is one of the biggest elements to growing up, and if that is taken away they become a completely different person. While distance learning can take away stress and can let students pace their day by how they want it, it takes away one vital point of a growing teenager's life. Stress can also teach lessons of time management. Some also say there is an experience to attending school and it sticks with you for the rest of your life. If you take that away, you are taking away an experience that all students should live with for their whole lives.

The act of waking up in the morning, getting ready for school, and going through the day on a schedule gives a routine for students. Without a routine, students would learn how to be productive or manage time. It gives something for students to do and follow, and without one they would just be doing nothing at home with no idea on how to spend their time.

A school classroom usually have an amount of around 15 to 30 students in each classroom. If distance learning became standard and everyone used it, that would put a lot more work on teachers. Every student would need their own teachers, and if that were to happen you would need up to 30 times the amount of teachers there are now. Distance learning will always be limited and not every student will be able to have access to this.

Although, it can sound like a great idea to students, distance learning doesn't encourage social interaction with peers or routine to keep them moving. School is much more important to students other than academic reasons. Going to school gives many attributes and teaches students an uncountable amount of valuable lessons that are very important to them when they grow older.",4,Distance learning,Independent
1E354DDC784B,"Everyday, when it comes to school, students are always absent for whatever reason. Regardless of what the reason is many teachers still believe you should come anyway. Students would benefit from video conferencing because students will not have to worry about being absent, and students are more comfortable at home.

With video conferencing, students will be able to work most of the time. Teachers will not have to worry about students being out because they are sick. People will not have to worry about students spreading germs. Also students can get whatever they need so they can feel better at home. Makeup work will not be a problem for students because they will always know what they have to do. It will be easier for students to catch up on work that they miss since they would not have to come to school in order to get it. And students grades will stay high because they will not have any missing grades in the grade book. Also, students can have video conferences wherevever they go. If they have to go to an appointment of some sort, they can still attend all the classes. Eventhough students will need an interent connection to do this, if they can get one then students will not have to worry about missing school work wherever they are.

Students are way more comfortable at home then at school. At home, students can wear whatever they would like to wear because there is no dress code. Students will not have to worry about teachers telling them to go to the office because of their clothing. Students will not have to worry about being late because they could not find what they wanted to wear for that day. Many students also will not have to worry about bullying. Whether someone is witnessing it or it is being done to them, students will not have to worry about this since they will not be around others. Students will have less stress since they will not have to worry about bullies and become focused on their schoolwork. Lastly, students will not have to worry about supension. With video conferencing, students can not get into to fights with other students. Students can not get suspended for being late to class or for skipping school. Finally, students can not get wriiten up other things like being disrespectful to other teachers.

In conclusion, video conferencing solves many issues. Students will almost always be available to work, and even if they are abesent they can catch up easier. Students can also be comfortable at home wearing whatever they would like to wear, avoiding school bullies, and avoiding suspension. Schools should really implement this into their system so that students can benefit in these ways.",4,Distance learning,Independent
F7FF64013DF7,"Wow, school has came a long way!

There are now a variety of schools; to name a few, boarding, driving, military, nursing, cosmetology, etc.

You name it they most likely have it!

You can say education has had its evolution.

Yet, one very controversial way of learning is online.

Many parents and educators are on edge about allowing their students to attend an online school.

Although many feel there is nothing to worry about when it comes to online school, here are a few things that may change your mind about taking these online courses.

School builds your skills, most of the websites online are huge scams, and being at school is, for the most part, a fun time!

Students deserve to be able to enjoy these years!

This is why students would not benefit from being able to work from home.

For one, being in school helps students with growing their skills.

Our skills are what makes us, us.

Without these skill-building assignments, students would not know how to do everyday things; for example, class presentations help students with their public speaking skills.

Many of the assignments students do in class are helping them grow as a person.

Speaking with classmates helps with their communication and people skills.

Having rules and school staff helps students build their much needed skill, active listening.

Without attending school filled with other individuals, students would not have the skills that are needed in the real world today.

To conclude, attending school is extremely efficient because it helps students build their skills.

Secondly, one key reason why attending school is the better option is because of scams.

Online can be a scary place.

There was an incident that happened in 2016, where a mother had found her 16 year old daughter on video call with what she was told was her ""online tutor"", except it was an registered sex offender.

One morning, the 16 year old girl told her mother that he was asking inappropriate questions, so her mother caught him in the act on camera and showed it to the police.

The mother was shocked because all of this happened on a website that claimed to be 100% safe.

Many parents dread allowing their children to have online school is because of this.

That just goes to show how dangerous it is to attend online courses.

Most of these websites give out false information to dumb students down which does nothing but waste the parents money.

In conclusion, online school is not the best option because of the scams they have to offer.

Others may say, students would benefit from being able to work online because students would not have to worry about the distractions like relationships, detention or suspension, or they would not have to deal with more serious issues like bullying.

Despite these reasons, home-schooling is not as beneficial because students will be missing out on a good time!

School has many fun activities you can attend.

Prom is a big one.

At school students won't just be working, they also are able to play sports, cheer, join clubs, etc.

Being home-schooled won't allow students to have the creativity or fun, as they would if they were in school.

To conclude, students should attend normal school over online for these reasons, school helps grow students skills, most of the websites online are scams, and being at school is, for the most part, a great time!

Studies have shown that 73.4% of students who attend a normal school over online grow up to be very successful!

So why not just have your children in a normal school?

Overall it's free!  ",4,Distance learning,Independent
030BBFC7D7F9,"In recent times, many schools have started to offer distance learning for students. Parents have voiced their opinions on the benefits and the detriments of online school. However, Students would benefit from taking online courses or video conference classes because students that may be considered unpopular may not fit into the learning environment, students may have no means of transportation to the school, and students with certain mental disabilities, physical disabilities, or medical conditions may not be able to function independently in a public school setting.

Distance learning for some students would be beneficial to their grades, mental health, and other inconveniences that come along with attending a public school. For example, my friend's brother Generic_Name was bullied all throughout elementary school and middle school and was considered an outcast by his peers. Due to this, he was always on edge while in school, causing him to fall behind in his classes. When he learned of the opportunity to complete his high school education from home, he applied immediately. Because he switched to online school, Generic_Name received better grades and was overall the happiest he had even been. Another example is my cousin Generic_Name. While in school, Generic_Name was constantly stressed by the pressure she felt to succeed placed on her by her parents, teachers, and fellow classmates. As a result, she could not focus on her studies and received disappointing grades on her report cards. Her parents learned of her situation and decided to let Generic_Name try online courses. Unknowingly, this was a great decision and my cousin felt more relaxed and got straight A's on the following report card.

For some students, getting to school on time every morning is a challenge. My best friend Generic_Name lived miles away from the nearest school and his parents had no way to take him to school and the buses did not come out as far as his residence. Therefore, he had no way to school, but if he was able to take online courses he would not have to worry about getting to school everyday. Another friend of mine, Generic_Name, lived on a secluded farm with his parents and lived too far for the buses, as well. In addition, he had to wake up very early in the morning to aid his parents with the livestock. In both cases, online courses would have been the best option and could become standard for those living far away from schools.

A video conference or online course experience would most likely be the best option for students with disabilities. As an example, a child with cancer would most likely have to be taken out of school in order to recover. However, they are missing vital information while out of school. Furthermore, children in the hospital most likely want to have the comfort of a relatively normal life. Online education would be a beneficiary to the child so it can still gain its education in recovery. Another example could be a child with cerebral palsy. Due to the child's condition, it may be hard for him of her to move around easily, so a large public school would definitely not be the greatest option for that student.

In conclusion, distance learning may not be the greatest option for the majority of students, but it would be a great option for certain students. Online school is a solution to any problem that might arise from having to attend public school, and could mean the success of a struggling students' endeavors.",5,Distance learning,Independent
F62AADC67A63,"Genuinely distance learning is a great way for students to take classes that they require. Most of the time this is due to the fact that someone in the family is part of the military or for some they are just accustomed to move around a lot. But sometimes it all just depends on the certain individual, for example if someone is a visual learner then online classes wouldnt really help because you cant understand it to the full extent. But say someone who learns just by looking at someone do something then online classes would help because the person can understand it better. Sometimes none of those are factors for someone choosing to do online classes, maybe its just that they like the isolation and peace that is hard to find in a classroom.

Online classes are beneficial for everybody especially if your someone who is busy and works a lot. Because of the classes being online then its easy to access anytime and anywhere. On the other hand if you can go to school and take the class in the classroom then i believe that is the better choice because there you can ask for help and get a better understanding then just seeing how to do it. Being in a classroom is a different ambient then working by yourself on a computer. Students would benefit from online classes or video conferencing because if they need the class to graduate and they work then it would be a perfect alternative than going to night school or doing it in class.

Schools should start to offer these opportunities to students because it would be a major help to them. It would change how some students see school and maybe try and give it another go. Most students see that they are failing and decide to just drop out because they dont want to come back to do the same class another time but if schools gave them an option to take it online then things would be different. If distance learning was an option many students would rather do it online than come to school            ",3,Distance learning,Independent
1529F615275D,"Some scools offer distance learning as an option for students. In my opinion i think students would benifet from being able to take classes from home.

To begin with, students would have a less likely chance of being bullied because they feel more comfortable at home than out where someone can make fun of them for being differnet bullying is a big issue in schools and is one of the number one issues that lead to suicide and school shootings in americ. If students have can learn from home they would be less likely to face problems like that at home.

As a reslut, some students may be fighting anxiety or depression and can not deal with all the stress that come wwith school if they are more comtorable with being home, Then they are most likely better off being home or somewhere else learning where they can focus and not worr a whole lot about things.

Letting kids learn from a distance will also make the graduation rate go up because kids wont be together to skip and kids wont incourage other kids to do drugs as much.

Last but not least, students in a group together is not a good idea because of fights and arguments. Studies show people in a crowded area are more likely to fight than in a small are because not evryone are the same they dont share the same ideals. But if students can learn in a environment that they are comfotablle with with and are not a group fight it would also solve fights in schools.

In conclusion, as we can conclude students who have a chance to have distance learning have a higher chance of making the wrong choices in lifemlike being encouraged to do drugs and have a lower chance of being bullied. Some kids also have anxiety and deppresion as result students are better off learing from a distane without any worries.",3,Distance learning,Independent
26F0870BE37F,"In the 21st century, technology has infiltrated the lives of Americans, entering into commercial, private, and education spheres. With this new spread of technological innovation, people are able to communicate over long distances. This long-distance communication and the invention of the internet allows students complete assignments online, with some even able to be digitally present in the classroom through video conferencing. However, this form of learning is not beneficial to students as it can reduce social skills and interaction, result in communication errors, and cause students to be distracted while learning from their home.

One of the main reasons attending classes from home is not a good form of learning is because it causes students to miss out on social interaction. The widespread use of technology can cause people to spend less time talking in person to someone and more time hiding behind a digital persona. With the use of video conferencing and online classes, students would not be able to have face-to-face interaction with their fellow students and would inevitably miss out on social skills that students who attend school gain. As much as school is about learning, it also teaches students how to communicate with others, how to become a leader, and how to work in a group. With the elimination of group projects, social interaction in between and during classes, and the absence of leadership opportunities, online school deprives children of their opportunity to grow their social skills. In addition, students will not be prepared for the workplace, as in a job, one has to communicate with employees and talk to their boss or supervisor frequently. With online school, a student does not have the opportunity to communicate directly with a teacher figure, learning how to express concerns, and form bonds with people that are higher up than them. Without this social skill of learning how to communicate properly with adults, a student is not fit to go into the workplace, making online school not a viable option. Due to the fact that students can hide behind a digital persona and not communicate with others due to technology, they would not be able to benefit from attending school from their home.

Secondly, with the introduction of online school, there would be miscommunication between the teacher and student, hurting the ability of students to learn. It has been shown through multiple tests and studies that technology hinders the ability of people to show emotions and convey what they are truly feeling, especially through online chatting and text messaging. This can be translated into online learning, as a student might not know what a teacher truly means through an email, causing a them to become confused. In an actual school scenario, a student would be able to talk to the teacher in person and ensure that they interpreted the information correctly. However, in online school from home, a student's ability to do this is taken away, as their teacher could be hundreds of miles away. Some might argue that with the introduction of video conferencing this lack of proper communication would be eliminated. However, with online school that could be streaming across the country, technology is subject to glitches and shutdowns. In addition, video chatting prevents the teacher from truly showing the student how to perform a task, as they are only able to communicate it verbally, rather than physically fixing it for the student. This could be present in the form of science labs. If a student is setting up the lab incorrectly, a teacher video chatting them may be a hard form of communication as the teacher can only describe to the student how to set it up, rather than actually showing them how to solve the issue in person. Therefore, video chatting is subject to miscommunication between students and teachers, not making it and online school a positive option for a student to learn from.

Lastly, a student learning from their home can cause them to be distracted, preventing them from focusing on their projects and lessons. A school is designed to create an environment that helps students focus on their classes and learning, with a set schedule, rules on phone usage and breaks, and quiet environments. However, at home it is the complete opposite, as there are multiple distractions. At home, students have distractions such as siblings, video games, and their phones, which could prevent them from giving their full attention to their schoolwork. In addition, without a set structure for online classes, it could cause students to take many unnecessary breaks, resulting in them falling behind their classmates in their classes. Next, some homes have parents working from home, pets, and young children that could create a noisy environment for a student to concentrate in. Without a proper quiet environment, a student would not be able to entirely focus on the courses they are taking. Finally, a student might ignore their school work altogether with at home classes, as with this new freedom a student would be able to meet with peers at any time, causing them to neglect their responsibilities as a student. Due to the distractions that are present at the home, online school that takes place in a student's house would not be a viable option for students to partake in.

With the addition of technology into the world, it may seem that learning from home with the use of technology is the best option for learning. However, attending a physical school and using computers as an aid to learning rather than a form of learning itself is the best option to prepare students for a digital world, as it will give them proper skills and tools to succeed along their learning journey. Because students can miss out on social lessons and skills, are subject to miscommunication, and can be severely distracted, students would not benefit from attending classes from home with the use of technology.",6,Distance learning,Independent
14F0D1DFE3B1,"Are you ready to graduate? then keep up with your good grades and finish school. Many children from k-12 learn different new things each day at school that will help them decide on the paths they want to take throughout their futures. so student should take their classes in school.

Taking in school classes can help you in so many beneficial ways. Students are able to communicate more better with their teachers in person if they have any questions or problems. Many teachers also stay after school to help other students raise their grades up by catching up on their missing assignments and give help to those who need help understanding an assignment better.

Students also learn better when they are being shown what to do in person. There are some students that are able to complete tasks or assignments by just listening to what they have been told to do, and other students who are visual learners and learn off better when someone has done an example of what they need to do first and finish without any trouble.

Finally there are some students that are too shy and unsociasble, by going to school it will make them feel more confident in themselves by getting to meet new people from all different places. become friends with others and learn new infromation about where they come from and how different it is from where they lived to now.

taking online classes is more difficult because you have to pay in order to be able to take the class you want and if you forget to take your class or do it, you can easily fall behind and being able to get help would be a struggle since nobody else is there to help you catch up on what you have missed. there are also students who go through bullying and feel like they dont belong at the school they go to and start missing school. later deciding they want to take online classes and just stay home all day.

In conclusion students should take classes in school where they could become more confident and learn self love towards themselves, being able to do tasks on their own, relate to other people who have gone through similar things as you and have people reliable to you to support you through everything, school is where the magic happens to the path of your future.           ",3,Distance learning,Independent
AF96A2176FB7,"Do you think students should have online classes at home? Do you think this will benefit the students in their life? In this paper, I will argue that students should not get online classes.

Students should not get online classes at home, because some students have to work and they are too busy to take online classes. Some people do not go to school, but they take online classes. some students work at night and they do not have time to take online classes. Students should not take online classes, because schools are for learning and home is for students to have fun, relax, and do what you want to do. Students should not take online classes, because they need to enjoy their free time while they are not in school. I do not want to take online classes, because I work at night and I do not have time to use online classes. My friend takes online classes when he is at home, but online classes took some of his free time.

Some people say, that students should have online classes because they need to focus in school and that they should start planning what they want to do when they are grown up and out of school. They are wrong, because life is not just to focus on what you want to do when you finish school, is to enjoy it and do whatever they want to do in their life. Some people want the best for their kids, but life is one and they should enjoy it.

I think in the future some students will go to school and do online classes in their free time, so they can focus on what they want. Some students will go to school, but they will not do online classes because they want to have a good career, but they do not want an excellent life like the other students.",3,Distance learning,Independent
151B0CD2ACE4,"The majority of students can say that going to school is their least favorite part of the day. This is one of the many reasons distance learning would be a step in the right direction. I believe distance learning will benefit the student body by reducing stress loads, giving students the option to do their work in a safe environment, and allowing them to ""attend"" school without having to physically be there.

Throughout the years of grade school the workload increases, but the amount of stress you are put under to get good grades also increases. Classrooms are thought of as the most boring place in the world, but really students can be distracted by a million things. The main classroom distraction is fellow classmates. On top of the constant buzz of sound put out from others speaking, there are also a massive number of times when a teacher will come into the classroom to speak with either your teacher or a student. This constant flow of people in and out of the classroom continually interrupts the lesson and makes it harder for the students to retain the information. As a society, we are in an awkward place with technology. Half of the information is still given on paper, and the other half is given electronically. This leaves room for students to lose important notes and/or study guides further stressing themselves out for an exam.

Within the last ten years the safety of students has really been called into question. Working in an unsafe environment keeps everyone in a constant state of fear. Distance learning gives the students a chance to do their work in a safe environment. There have been studies that there has been a direct correlation between bullying and low grades. By eliminating one of the ways bullying can take place, students will have a better chance of succeeding. In the most recent history, there have been more than 5 major school shootings in the United States alone. More than half of the schools in America have had a gun scare in the last 7 years. Parents take extra precautions to know their child's whereabouts because of these dangers. With parents breathing down their necks and a fear of the worst every time the school goes into lock down, students can not concentrate. Within the last 4 months, the world has been in a battle with the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Some schools have been shut down indefinitely due to the outbreak and the fear of it spreading. Students, that attend schools that do not have distance learning plans in place, are missing weeks of education. This will take a toll on their grades and exam scores.

Some students are physically incapable of attending school on a regular basis. Distance learning gives them an opportunity to ""attend"" school without having to be there. After undergoing a medical procedure, most physicians recommend time out of school to recover properly and reduce the risk of complications. One of the major reasons to stay out of school while recovering is to keep stress levels at a minimum. By missing school there will be mounds of missing work and lectures that can not be assigned if the school does not have a distance learning plan. Although the students will be given the opportunity to do their work outside of school this requires a large amount of accountability. Allowing them to do their work on their own time leave room for laziness.

Implementing a distance learning program will reduce stress levels, provide a safe work environment, and give students the option to ""attend"" school without physically being there. With these new changes the student body will thrive. Without them schools will continue to lose precious educational time.",5,Distance learning,Independent
B8D4D1B62526,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. However; the question is students would benefit from being able to attend class from home? It is seems to me that attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes at school; In addition, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers; Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. With out a doubt, school provides knowledge, values, and skills that will benefit students in their academic life, as well as, their social life.

In the first place, attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes that school offers. For example, my High School provides different types of optional classes, as Electricity, Cosmetology, Floral Design, and others, which is enthusiastic for some students. Last semester my friend Generic_Name took Floral Design Class. Generic_Name went to numerous fascinating fill trips of her Floral Design Class. Additionally, she was one of the organizer of the decoration of the Graduation Night

Generic_Name was so dedicated to her Floral Design Class that she was always talking about becoming a florist in a future.

Certainly, unlike the students that take classes from home do not have the opportunity to create talents at school that will make beneficial for their academic life.

Pursuing this further, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers. For instance, teachers, administrators, and councilors can provide support at students in their homework, classes, or even their personal lives. Ms. Generic_Name my ESL teacher she is one of the great examples of it. I am not trying to brag, but she demonstrates day by day the importance of being communicate. Moreover, every day in class as we transmit our ideas we learn more about the topic in which we are discussing and also we gain experience of her voyage to became a teacher. In fact, she always mention that strives with determination for our goals take us to denied the fears to reach the victory. Nevertheless, school plays an important role in students life.

Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. For example, students that take classes at home are procrastinators because they do not have rules, or people that can help them in their personal development, which is a important for all students. In fact, we humans are not born with all our qualities or talents. At school we can built manners, values, and skills that will contribute in our future jobs, or social life. In order to success in life we have to come to school not to stay at home.

By all counts and with proven results; there is no doubt that attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes at school; In addition, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers; Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives.

DBF35E9F40A2,"I think students should not get the benefit on taking online classes from home.

My reason why I say that is because I feel like they're going to be easily distracted. I say that because most kids gets easily distracted in school right now. Due to phone and not turning in work on time being the time given to them . So I don't think that time the student gets home he/she is going to do the work. Beacause they're going to think of it like this.

They have 24hrs to get a couple of online/video classes done in the mean time they have only 8hrs in school to get the work done. Well at least I know I wouldve thought of it that way.

But you know some students think different about things like this some students might want get it done then and there. Not waste any other free time they may get to do any work. Like some students might take this as an advantage and get as much work done as possible so they have the extra free time other days.

And some students have jobs they might want to get they're work done in the morning and go to work come home and not have any work to do when they come home

But as I said in the first paragraph I would've thought of it different then any other scholar/students.

As an example; If I were to go on vacation and only have online classes I would get the work out of the way so i could have more fun on the vacation.

But I guess all I am really trying to say is it could really be a big debate. About if schools should offer any online classes to students or not.

they should use these options when there is bad weather or ice roads outside so that studdents do not miss there education due to the bad weather students can keep up with there classes and with there grades.

83BB96F966DB,"Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students would rather want to be able to work in their own comfortable environment and be able to work at their own pace.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they can work at their pace because if the students missed a day or two of school, the online class is there to provide them easy access to work they might have missed. Another point is, some students tend to much rather like to work in an environment they feel comfortable in or that they feel safe in. Lastly, It would benefit their learning skills by having a tool to use that could be helpful for them when they attend school personally.

Students working at their own pace could be helpful and beneficial to them in many ways. Having to be rushed or pressured to do work may not be the best for any grade school students. If a student missed a couple days of school, the online class is there to provide for the lesson they learned the days of or the work that was missed without the work being turned in late or graded poorly. A student being able to work at their own pace is also extremely beneficial because it gives them more time to fix imperfections and be able to ace the work that was given. Students often do terribly on work they rushed on or do terribly when they did not have enough time to finish.

Students usually tend to work better in a environment they feel comfortable and safe in. Students who dont like the environment they are in can get easily distracted in their surroundings. Being distracted can cause trouble all around. Not only does it cause trouble, It stops students from getting their work done and their peers work done. These online classes can provide them to do their work in a environment they feel that they are safe or comfortable in without having to distract themselves or anybody around them. If a student feels that they are uncomfortable in their surroundings, that can take over their mind and distract them from what needs to be done.

Having an online class for students can be a benefit their learning skills by having a tool to use that could possibly be helpful for them for when they attend public school. Online classes could teach the student another way how to solve a problem in a way public school could not. With the information they learned online, they can carry that on with them and be successful in a class they have trouble on or for future references. The online class may explain the topic another way that the school did not and makes it easier for the student to understand what they are learning.

In conclusion, students would much rather benefit from being able to attend classes from home than being able to attend public schools or having to do a class in school. These classes can help students in a way public school classes could not. Being able to work at your own pace, not be distracted while do work, and learning new topics can be helpful for somebody who needs online classes.        ",4,Distance learning,Independent
BF9ACEA631D8,"The majority of people expect is the best way students can learn is going to the school than attend classes from home, when they are taking classes online from home sometimes they never look at it or never do the work, because nobody is telling him to do the work or go to learn. If the students go to the school and they don't work, teacher can call their parents and tell as about their child.

Sometimes students need help with someting like if they don't understand or they have a lot of work, teacher can teach again and again and if the boy or girl can't get it the teacher can teach in other way, the other students can help or helping each other, also if the teacher give a lot of work students can have a partner to share the work and that way can be more easy to have the work done.

If the parents want to know if their kids are learning in school, they can ask in the school how their kids going in each classes, the teacher can send an e-mail to each parents to know his or her grades, if he need more help to learn and with that the parents can know if they are learning or not, and also the school can call the parents if their child are not going to the class and talk with their child what happen.

The parents can feel more confidents because they child are learning, teacher can teach more better than have online classes at home, they can receive more help because the teacher are their for anything they needs. And some schools has eagle block for students who need help with one class or they need more time to study. They can get textbooks and look in classe with that.

But some people like more their kids receive classes at home, some parents like mom or dad can stay at home and watch if they are learning or not, their are some classes online with more information than school has, they can watch video conferencing because they can explain more clearly.",2,Distance learning,Independent
343A95F8B1A2,"Schools are a place of learning and advancing your skills like math, science, and writing. Schools were made to educate children and help the children if they are struggling in any subject. As schools advanced and provided many opportunities, some of the opporunities negatively impacts the student's learning like distance learning. Distance learning is another way of learning that lets the students take classes at home by using online chats or video conferences. Schools that offer distance learning as an option do not benetfit the students because lack of real communication, lack of performance, and distraction at home.

Schools that give distance learning have a lack of real communication between student and teacher because the student can't receive specific details or help from the teacher through just a computer. For example a student that needs help to setup a lab at home can't really get the help he or she needs compared to the students that are in class and can ask direct help from the teacher. Kids also lack of communication within students and could negatively impact the learning process. For example a class is given a project and it has to be with partners, it makes it more difficult for the other students to learn and get the assignment done when they have somebody in their group that is there but not physically there to perform. Schools that give out distance learning are having a negative impact on student's coummincation.

Schools with distance learning may see lack of performance of students who take distance learning because kids are given a opportunity to slack off a bit at home. Although, not all kids will slack off it gives the opportunity to slack off, especially to the kids that get distracted easily and aren't really focused. An example of lack of performance is students can get distracted by anything at home which impacts the students performs on his or hers work for school. Distance Learning through video chat isn't alway promised to work out, things like techincal difficulty could happen and could lead the student missing steps or important information for an assignment leading the lack of performance. Lack of performance is a possibility of distant learning although not all student will be not be affected but a majority will be.

Distractions at home definitely impact negatively on the students learning and work ethic because many things at home can get in the way of the student's education. For example problems at home ,like family issues, can be a distraction and get in the way of the childs learning. Entertainment at home is also another distraction for students who take distance learning because entertainments like tv and videogames are available to the student. If the student has a pet, like a cat and a dog, it could be a distraction to the student's learning because the pet might try to play or need to use the restroom during the student's video chat. Responibility at home are also a distraction at home because some students might have choris to do and might be fully focused if that's in the back of their mind. Distraction at home can vary and definitely have huge negative impact on the student's learning and performance throughout the video chat.

Distraction at home can be anything like responibility at home, entertainment, and pets and have a bad impact on the student's learning and performance. Lack of communication is a negative factor to the student's education and benefits because theres a no student and teacher lack of coummnication and lack of student communication. Student who take distance learning have a lack of peformance because of distractions and personal issues that may be going on at home. Although, not all student will have a poor performance but majority will have a poor performance and damage their education. Schools that off distance learning as an option for students do not benefit because lack of real coummincation, lack of performance, and distractions at home.",5,Distance learning,Independent
6B38FB57A1D3,"Students every year are increasing from skipping school. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students should all have an option to learn from home. Some people can work better with online classes or videos. Students are sometimes not in the mood to go to school or see some other people at school, if so they could stay home and learn there with their classes.

Some people can work better with online classes or videos. It can help kids if they dont really like there classes or if they are very independent. This is very neat and i think a lot of students would benefit off of it. Expertise now with this new technology some people like working on the laptops so they would like if they could sit at home and work on class. Students can also not worry about getting up early and getting dressed for school, they can just get up and get on there laptop and do there class work.

Students arent happy to go to school all the time, but with this option they can do they classes online or watch videos about there classes. At home students can be conflictual and safer. The work at home can be nice they can take breaks and eat food whenever they want, therefore they would still have to work on there class work.

however, student could always get distracted and not do there work. They can also choose just to take a day off at home so there should be a parent near to push them. Parents should be near the student while doing work so they can see what they are working on and help them if needed.

So i think thats why we should have an option if students should have online classes at home or watch videos about there classes. either or is a good thing i like the idea. Some people still like going to school so that is fine too. Like i said early parents should be in on this and be there with there kids if they do choose to stay home.                                                           ",3,Distance learning,Independent

Some schools offer distance learning as an option students to attend classes from home by away of online of video conferencing; some students take this way to learn, but the purpose to learn is get it very well. That mean this is better when you go to school with people that is already qualified to teach the stuffs you need to learn in your process, and basically, they are there for everything you need to ask them. But what happen when you take the way to learn away? there are a couple things to talk.

First, you always need to ask questions, and I think this is the most important obstacle,for example: you do not have someone to ask immediately, that is a big benefit to be in class, some people need more than one time to understand a topic or an exercise. May be in a test you need an explication for a question that you do not understand and there is a big problem. This may work when you live far away from a civilization, or you are sick with something strong and is not easy move you body. If you have to work, that is another valid reason to take some classes in your computer because you need time to make money to pay your bills.

Second,you can cheat on the quizzes or even in the big tests that the school assigned to you. If must students cheat being in the school with someone supervising, you can do it at your home too; may be take some notes out, or search in Google some answers, or call a friend with the phone, even ask to your mom or your dad in your home. That mean you are not learning and you never going to learn if you are cheating. After this, you just getting a good grade bad nothing of knowledge and that is why we need some extra help, a person who answer our questions.

Third, the work assigned to the students from the school is not too easy, those are a couple pages and some exercises to do for just one class, so you have to read and understand all by yourself and answer the questions, send that to your teacher and wait until the next document with the exact same dynamic, and that is how you are ÃÂ¨ learning ÃÂ¨, reading papers, and answer questions. Must of the students does not pass the class, the arguments from them are that no one explain very well the way that they have to do the work and when the test comes they do not know nothing. As I said, you still can ask the teacher or look for help in internet, but is not the same thing.

Finally, most of the students has to take the class again, losing all their time that they been doing putting in that class. After all that process, they understand the important to be with someone helping you and not be away from the school. A lot of teachers say that is not a good choice take distance learning, they say is hard and be alone is more difficult, but as I said, I think is good for the people who really cant assist to school.                       ",4,Distance learning,Independent
DC25CFE5EACC,"Would you rather wake up early every day just to go to school and feel grumpy every morning? Or would you attend school at your house? The 2nd option sounds better right? But,is it really that nice? Going school is more than learning about old people fighting,numbers,reading,and writing essays. Its about making friends and connecting with teachers and be more responsible. Also one importent thing about school is that its free. Online classes are expencive,hard to get used to,and impossible to work at home. This is why attending online school wont be worth it.

First of all,.online classes can go up to 150 to 200 dollars. So, some students cant afford the classes. If you want to get online classes, you must get a job and work for weeks just to pay for online classes. When you can just go to school for free. Also if you do get a job it will affect your work at school and it will affect your job. So. is it worth it?

Secend of all, students can not focus when they are at home. Cant work on your homework because your little brother is crying nonstop? Just imagine doing an online class for 90 minutes at home. Also, home is a place to rest,have free time,and spend time with family and friends. Home is not a place for school.

Lastly,online classes can be hard to get used to. You have been in a class room this hole time in school. Now you have to get used to something new. Change can be hard on students. But,now they are all by themself in there house learning how to get through this online class. Where theres no one to help you but you. I am taking an online class in my last year of high school. Its hard. Its really hard. You wont understand what to do and what not to do. Because there is nobody showing me how to do it. Its just a 3 minutes video and now i have to wright a 3 page essay. And not knowing what kind an essay to wright. Sometimes there are no videos to help you.

Some people say that online classes are better then regular school. Well they are worng. Heres why,school can help you get your commnicaion skills up and help you grow as a person. Teachers at school can help you to get through the class. In online class you dont know if you are doing something right or worng. There is no one to giude you but yourself. It is not better then regular school when you think about it. Online classes you are so limited you dont understand. At school you will have some many more opitions for you.

in conclusion waking up at 6 oclock is going to be worth it at the end. If you attend online school the only person is going to help you is you. Or you can make friends,do group activites,and enjoy every last minute if it in school.",4,Distance learning,Independent
E81B50098AAC,"In my opinion students should come to school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students,which allows the students to be irresponsibles and not to show their work to the teacher. As we can see taking classes online is not a good option to us, for instance if we dont make the time to attend the classes online, or by the time we are taking the online classes we received a text for friend we stop doing what we are doing and got distracted by the electronic devices and, others words if we come to school received classes we are going to be able to get the knowledge that we need to be great in our academic life.

I consider myself that taking online classes is not a good option for students. Some students that take online classes are procrastinators,they dont care about their homework, or they wait until the last minute to do it. The truth is, if we dont take our online classes seriously how we are going to learn. For example,

My friend Generic_Name is taking online classes and she said that taking online classes allow her to be irresponsible by not doing her homework.

Some students dont make the time to take the online classes and we just forget to take it. I wonder how we are going to learn if we dont make the time to do it. Sometimes we got distracted for something that have nothing to with the class that we are taking. However, if we have a job and we got home late, and in our mind is to get home and take the online classes, but when we get home we are so tired and we just want to go to bed, and forget about what we have to do.

The last and more important reason what we should take classes in school is, if we attend to school,we can ask questions to the teacher and he can provides us with a powerful answers and specific examples, if we attend to school that will helps us to get a responsibility to be every day at school and not to miss any important class, and also that would gives the knowledge that we would need to be great in life.

In final consideration I think students should come to school and take our classes, that way we would learn more better than taking it in online, and also that we will makes us more responsible. As we take the classes in school we will get the knowledge that we would need to success in our academic life in general we would be great in our professional life.  ",3,Distance learning,Independent
6B9F6BDE002B,"School is traditionally an in-person, multi-class, time-consuming thing that kids must attend, but what if that changed? Well, it might. Some schools are now starting to offer online school. Online school lets a person go to school online on their own time. Online school allows a person to learn through videos and take their quizzes, tests, and class work online. Online school is not the only thing some schools are introducing though. There is also a version where a student can video conference for school. Video conferencing allows someone to video a teacher and learn. There is a slight difference, but overall similar in terms of it being over the internet. With all of the changes happening in the world, could this be a major game-changer? It just might be. Online schooling offers kids to be more responsible, have less stress-induced problems, and take control of their life.

Online school can reduce stress among younger aged people in many ways such as getting more sleep, having less stress-inducing factors around them, and it gives them more time to do things they actually enjoy. Take this as an example, a young teenage girl wakes up at 6am every morning and leaves for her bus at 6:30am. She gets on the bus and talks to friends and gets to school at around 7:00. When she gets to her homeroom she feels tired, but know she has to stay awake so she won't get behind in her classes. By her last class of that day, she has taken two quizzes, got assigned homework in each class, learned she has a test the next time she goes to one of her classes, learned she has a band concert on Sunday, and learned about a project she completely forgot about that is due in two days. When she gets home, she is too tired to even think about starting her homework and takes a nap. When she wakes up she does her homework, but she barely has time to do much else that day. She can not really ask her teachers about an extension on her project because she was just stressed and forgot about it, half of the school deals with the same type of issues. If she did online school she could have gone to her classes with enough energy to put up with everything she was getting, she could potentially finish the classes earlier than she would in school, do homework, and she could still have time to finish her project and maybe even practice her instrument.

Online school could also help kids take control of their life and show them how to be more independent and responsible. If a student took online school they would have more time, which means they could do something with their extra time like get a job or help learn in real life skills that schools would not teach them. If a family was struggling financially and a kid wanted to help out, online school would be really useful because that kid could pick their own school hours and be able to manage their time around that. They could finish their school work, get job experience, and help their family out all because of online school. Another example could be, what if a kid could not take the mental toll of school, but did not want to drop out. Online school would be useful because they could take their time slowly and actually be able to learn and focus on what they are struggling with, rather than sitting lost in class and having to stay after school and waste more time trying to understand.

Like everything, online school also has its cons. If someone just genuinely did not like school and tried everything to avoid it in the first place, then obviously online school would not be for them. If a normal social person tried doing online school, it would probably be more harmful than helpful because it could lead them to shutting themselves out from not being able to meet anyone or make plans in person with anyone. Kids struggling with illnesses such as depression might not be able to keep up with the online classes and end up falling behind anyways. Online school is just a situationally helpful way to stay and learn just on the person's own time. If a students parents and teachers know a kid would not be the right fit for online school, then it would not be recommended for that kid. Overall, online school would beneficial for most students who are struggling with anxiety, sleep-induced issues, or lack of time to do anything because of traditional schooling ways. It would also be beneficial for people who have good time-management or people that want a head start for their career goals or just people who need to financially support themselves.",6,Distance learning,Independent
6C25E5BA529E,"When you need the education, but is not able to accessed from where your are, you have to resort to the next best thing, online schools. The statement made asking if it's beneficial to do online school learning at home or not, my opinion is that it is beneficial for the students to take online classes at their homes. Reasons being that for the students that may have some problems with convenience, online schooling would near completely erase that. There is the convenience of being able to learn online from almost anywhere, students being able to do the learning at their own time, and for students to have a higher chance of wanting to learn since they have the choice of when they want to learn and where they would work best in.

The first evidence is that there is the convenience of being able to learn from almost every location around the world where there is wifi or some form of data connectivity. If the student is in a location where he or she is not able to get to the school physically let it because of environmental reasons or health reasons, the use of the internet can allow them the close the gap between them and the teachers thorough a simple video face cam process. With the added benefit of being able to do it anywhere it can also attribute to their comfort, since if they are in a area where they are most comfortable learning in such as their homes, which by its self can help them learn better in a place where the student, attending the online class, is most familiar with. There is also the convenience of time, since if time is not on the students side and they miss a online class day they can simply get a recording of the session allowing he or she to catch up on the topic. There is also the near face to face conversations with the teacher through video/ face cam, since if it was a private lesson the student and the teacher can get a one on one in two different locations of the world. There are also many free online schools willing to teach for free, so if the student is not able to afford it there are still free online classes for them to take that may very well be not so different from the other online classes where you have to pay.

The second evidence of the benefits of online learning is that the student can learn at their own pace. School these days, in the modern twenty first century, can make you get up early and make you sleep very late cause of the given work loads and the amount of topics needed to be studied, leading to sleep deprivation, and it can really impact the performance you have at school which can risk your grades. Thats why the benefits of being able to do the learning at the students convenience is so important. Since the student can wake up at their earliest convenience to get rid of any added fatigued or tiredness so that the student can have the maximum efficiency to learn the topic at hand. This leads the students to have the added benefit of working better just because of getting more sleep. With the increase amount of sleep this gives the added benefit of the student willing to learn, since they are energized and ready to learn they don't have to feel that they are being forced to learn at their worst conditions, especially in a classroom setting where they may also be unnecessary tension or pressure towards the student to meet their teachers expectation there and now.

The third evidence is from my own experience, I myself have never done any online classes but I know many friends and family members who do take the online classes and most if not all have given me positive reviews of the online classes they have taken. My cousin in South Korea right now for about three to four year have been taking an online class to learn a different language. The language that my cousin wanted to learn was not a language that was being taught at her current school. So she took to the internet and had found a amazing teacher form Europe willing to teach from minimal pricing for a contract of 3 year teaching, which lead to my cousin having a good deal. Through the online lessons my cousin was able to learn her preferred language and at a low cost, which saved her financially since my cousin was a bit tight on money, and allowed her to learn at home the environment of where she feels the most comfortable at, since is South Korea comfort is a necessity in a academically competitive country. It is not just my cousin numerous friends of mine, who took online classes, have told me that taking a online class at their homes increases the sleep and convenience while decreasing the work load for them at the same time, also allowing them to go over the given notes or materials constantly instead of having to continue on without knowing the material, which makes them want to do the class more, also the online classes have allowed my friends to come to a near face to face experience with the teacher of the online class they were taking.

With that being said, through the many added benefits of taking online classes at home. It allows the student to have the convenience of being able to take the class anywhere with wifi or data connectivity and getting the maximum amount of comfort in their own homes, allowing the students taking the online class to do the work at their own time to ensure that the student is ready to learn at their best shape possible during the day, and the evidence of my family member and friends enjoying the convenience of the online class/classes they are taking at home making them want to do the online class even more. So are online classes taken at home beneficial or not, with the evidence and reasoning given I think it is safe to say that it is beneficial.",5,Distance learning,Independent
61EDBF8CEC7D,"Do you get boerd being at home all the time? Well, imagine having to go home and take classes online. Some say, students benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video confrencing. On the otherhand, others suggest that students taking classes online can cause lot's of distraction, being anti-social, and giving an oppurtunity to cheat on a subject without getting true help, and support from a teacher in school.

We all like being on social media and communicating with our friends and family whenever we have the chance. But, texting your freinds and trying to do your work at the same time can be a huge distraction. However, if a student is giving an advantage to take classes online, it will cause a student to get off task and go on their phone without having the right discipline like a regualr school would have.

In a regular school, students would have the oppurtunity to communicate with their peers. For example, if a teacher assigned a project for the class and told them they are able to work in groups. This wouldn't only count as a grade but, being able to be social with your classmates and not being able to do the work independently. Which is a great idea so that it wouldn't cause a student to be ant-social.

Finally, giving a student the advantage to take classes online will give them the idea of going to a different website and finding the answers to the question. Ironically, that's what a student would do if they had the chance to. But, would it be helpful to ask for guidence, from someone who can actually give you some ways to help make you understand the topic. Not being able to get that type of help can be stressful and cause you to cheat.

In conclusion, taking classes online isn't a bad idea if wanting to finish school faster. But, it can also cause you to get distracted , anti-social, and not having the ability to get proper help when struggling with a specific topic.                ",4,Distance learning,Independent
6783CF0808E5,"The public school system has several benefits. One of the major ones is the fact that children ages 5-18 get free education. That being said, it can be hard for students to take a true advantage of the free education system because it can be quite strict. A major issues is school attendance. Most students are in school from 7am to 2pm five days a week which can become quite hard to maintain, especially when a student is out sick. Another issue is learning. In general students all learn differently and for the most part the public school system tends to only teach material in one or two different ways. Having classes from home could be beneficial to students by allowing them to be present even when sick, allowing them to be comfortable during the school day, and allowing them to learn in their own way.

Coming down with the flu or a common cold is something no person wants; it makes a person feel terrible and causes them to miss important events. In elementary school or even middle school coming down with a cold was never that big of a deal but as students begin to enter high school it can be very challenging to stay on track with work even if the student is only out for one or two days. Not only are they having to make up homework, classwork, and tests that they may have missed but now they have to continue to stay up to date with their present work; along with after school clubs, sports, and maybe a job a students can begin to fall behind extremely fast. With students having the access to classes at home this issue is barley a concern. Students will be able to see their lesson plans at any time of the day and have the resources to complete them correctly while doing it for their own bed. Now, having classes online doesn't mean that a student will want to finish all of his/her work while out sick, but it does reduce a lot of stress from their workload.

Being comfortable is a big part of learning, if a student is in pain, too hot, too cold, or anxious it can cause them to not comprehend materials as well as they could. Being around a large number of people, public speaking, group work, fights etc. are all reasons why students may feel uncomfortable at school. Wearing what they want, being able to go outside, eating what they want, using the bathroom when they want, and having the ability to take time to rest are all reasons why students would feel more comfortable in their own home. These comparisons don't speak for all students but in general being comfortable plays a large part in how people get work done. Making it beneficial for schools to have the option of accessing classes online.

Being comfortable physically is a important to a student's learning, but so is being comfortable mentally. This means a students should feel able to learn at their own pace and in a way they feel works best for them. Teachers all have different types of teaching strategies including just taking notes, interactive work, PowerPoint, group work, presentations, or combining all of these. For many students they may resonate with one of the strategies but what about the six other classes they take? One might excel in math because they find it very easy to understand the teacher but that same person might fail history because they don't understand the notes they are handed. With classes from home students don't have to take the risk of succeeding in one or two classes and struggling in the rest. Students will be able to see the lesson and find what works for them in order to understand the lesson. No matter if that is through reading, watching videos, playing interactive games, taking quizzes etc. the student will have the option to explore what works for them.

Even though there are a lot of benefits to having the ability to access classes online people may argue that going to school is still better for the student then staying at home. Public school provides the student with the opportunity to be social throughout the week, develop structure and authority in a students life, and show them responsibility. Even though this is true learning is still a different journey for every student. So, while some students may enjoy going to school others find it extremely difficult. Which is why having classes from home could be beneficial to a student because it allows them to be on top of their work even when out sick, comfortable while learning, and having the ability to learn at their own pace. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
71C866E275D9,"We live in a modern era where screens and technology are everywhere, but school can be an escape from all of those for many students. Students would not benefit from attending classes through online video conferencing. This is because looking at a computer screen would negatively affect their eyesight and health, teachers would not be able to physically help the students if they are miles away from one another, and also because this would absurdly decrease interaction between students, therefore harming their social and conversational skills.

Every year, new studies are conducted on how television and phone screens harm not only our eyes but also our mental and physical health. Most teenagers and young adults spend multiple hours a day watching television, playing video games, or scrolling through their phones when they are bored and it negatively affects them greatly. Playing video games and watching television for too long has been linked to the killing of brain cells and also to decreased physical health because instead of getting exercise or playing outside, some would rather play on their computer or binge watch an entire television series in one sitting. My parents encourage my sister and I to go outside or play a board game instead of wasting our time re watching multiple episodes of

The Office on Netflix, but we just nonchalantly shrug off their advice and make up an excuse as to why we cannot, or do not, want to do so. From my own personal experience, after a few hours of focusing on a movie or a video game my eyes begin to hurt because of the immense strain that I have put on them and they continue to sting for multiple hours afterwards, sometimes making it difficult to fall asleep, let alone stay asleep.

Secondly, students that would attend school through video conferencing would not be able to access the personal touch and inter activeness of being within reach of a certified educator. I have struggled in many subjects before, but whenever I did not understand a subject or a certain lesson, I was always able to ask my teacher for assistance and explanations which helped greatly increase my understanding afterwards. I have stayed after school and received help during lunches on multiple occasions and after every tutoring session, I felt content in knowing that I reached out and got the help that I needed. However, this would not be an option for the students that decide to stay at home and attend online schooling. While explanations can be given through computer screens, only so much can be completely understood. For example, if there was a science lab held at school while a student was attending through the internet, that student would not possibly be able to experience and perform the lab that many others would because of their physical absence from the classroom. This is why physical attendance has always been a requirement and I do not believe that should change any time soon.

Lastly, if students were to attend school and receive their education through video conferences, then they would miss out on being socially active with other students and also on being a part of tradition. For almost a century, going to school and making friends and memories is an amazing journey that a great majority of our parents and grandparents experienced and want us to experience as well. People thrive on interaction with other people. Whether it be a long, heartfelt conversation or a brief one with few words spoken. When I am sick or under the weather and stay at home, I dreadfully regret it because I miss my friends and sometimes I become so bored of not being at school that I actually miss learning, too. You also cannot physically attend events during school if you are not present to do so, making it very difficult to enjoy other student's company and make memories because all you will every remember is sitting in an office, staring at a screen with no one to talk to, laugh with, and enjoy your teenage years with, and I do not believe that anyone should have to experience that, even if it is what they think they want.

However, it is understandable to want to be able to attend school through video conferencing. Video conferencing would allow students to stay in the comfort of their homes and to also wear practically whatever they would like to, like pajamas or baggy sweatpants. Attending through a video conference could also be very beneficial for those that are sick or unable to make it to school regularly. While these may seem appealing enough to want to have this option for your school, these benefits do not outweigh the negative costs of having little to no social interaction, having no personal, in person help from teachers, and also how it affects your health, both mental and physical.

In conclusion, implementing and allowing students to not physically attend school would not be beneficial for the students and therefore should not be considered. Allowing students to choose to learn from home should not be an option because it would negatively affect their social skills, their overall well being, and also put their grades and future at risk. Students need to enjoy school and think of it as a fun learning environment where they make memories with people they care about and love. Schools should not offer the option of attending through devices such as computer or phones because of these many reasons and more.                                                                                                                               ",6,Distance learning,Independent
2285E3878B94,"Over the years distance learning has become more of a norm. Many people used to consider online school to be lesser than physical, but the results that have come from online have shown to give positive and effective results. Students would benefit from attending classes at home giving them more of a stress free environment and more flexibility.

When many people think of online school they might quickly jump and think that there are a lot of negatives and that physical school would ideally be the better option for students, but when you compare the two options you would be surprised as to what online school provides. In recent years school has never caused so much stress or anxiety to students. Students receive this stress from many factors like peers that compare themselves to one another, which causes a sense of competition and comparison for the student to think that they are not ""as smart"". There is lots of stress from society as well in the youngest generation, pushing them in that they have to be successful, the top of the class, and this is caused by schools and peers. With online school, it provides the student to work in an environment they feel comfortable in, and by being at home or some other environment they are less in risk to be stressed out and compare themselves to other students with academics. Students can also work at their own pace and thoroughly understand the information they are learning, which positively enforces learning. When students are pushed on this one idea, and it is heavily forced upon them, they are likely to resent it. With this stress, it can cause students to start to hate learning, and give that sense of resentment towards the school system. Pushing students so much can cause burn out, which can give long term effects on a student with heavy disregard for school and education as a whole. This environment has only increased over the years, and has already given effects like mental health issues shown in students.

Online school allows students to learn the same information, but in an environment that will suit them better or provide the comfort of less pressure to the child. Some may say that will too much comfort, the student will start to slack in school. Though the student can choose when to start school and their own hours, they need to complete a certain amount a day to stay on course, and though it also depends on each student, majority show positive results and that they stay on track with their courses by being somewhere they feel comfortable and more a ease to. Each student has a unique situation so it also depends on that, for example, many students start to pursue their careers or are able to follow their dreams early. By having online schooling, kids are able to do this and it gives them flexibility in their schedules' for school and to continue with their dreams. Many student athletes that are on the road to the Olympics, or students that have started a business and that do not have the time to go to school for most of the day, will take online schooling to focus on those other things. Many people might think that is being a bad student not prioritizing school, but many students already have gotten a jump start to their future and don't need to be attending full time schooling, or just physical school. People like Micheal Phelps, and Simone Biles would not be as successful as they are today if they did not switch from attending physical school to online school, and it goes to show that you can do online school and still be just or even more successful. This option of having online school for these types of students is highly beneficial by giving them that flexibility.

People will make the argument that online school doesn't provide the needs for student education or the interaction and relationships they get from school, but if a student is having trouble learning online, they can video chat an actual teacher to get help and talk to a teacher, just like they would if they went physically to school. The student would not be teaching themselves, they would have assistance and support from real teachers if they need explanation or other help. The education portion of online schooling is very similar to physical, but there are huge mental differences for the student. Online provides the proper aid and positive mental health responses from the student allowing them to still enjoy school and education. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
F67D6B12D494,"Multiple studies have shown learning from home is extremely beneficial. Students receive more sleep, are one task, and there are less distractions. Most children do not obtain a full 8 hours of sleep that is recommended. Causing students to be more likely to sleep during instructional time. When students study at home it is very likely that their parents will hold them accountable for their assignments and or class work. Students tend to listen to their parents rather than a teacher, because most children see their parents as someone of authority and power. When students learn at home there are less distractions that can stray the child away from the task at hand. Overall learning from home can be very beneficial if it is done the right way, and with the right amount of strictness and regulations.

Every student can benefit from more sleep, because most do not get enough sleep as it is. Almost every school system obligates students to wake up somewhat early to attend school. Most likely students do not want to be there because they are extremely exhausted. Some students are detrimentally tired that they feel like they have no other choice but to sleep in class. That is where learning from home is beneficial, because students can attend class online or by video conferencing on their own time. It makes it convenient for students to actually complete school work. If students are well rested they are usually much more efficient than when they are sleep deprived. Students who attend school at home receive more sleep. Which results in an efficient student whose work is completed diligently.

When students learn from home they are either learning online or are video conferencing. Which makes it difficult to ignore your teacher when they are online with you. It is a bit difficult to stray away from from your task if you are learning by this method. Students would need to deliberately detach themselves from their device so they could stray away from their class work. Video conferencing is a great way to keep students on task, because they can not run away from their responsibilities if a teacher is video conferencing them. It forces the students to focus and work more diligently. Parents might also play a similar role as the teacher by holding their child accountable for missing assignments. In theory it is very easy to keep a student on task by using this method, because it supplies a scenario in which a child can not avoid class work.

Most people have a hard time focusing when their friends are around, especially when it comes to school work; The same goes for students. When children around their age are constantly talking to them or trying to play with them during instructional time it becomes an issues. The student can not focus therefor they can not learn. Resulting in the student falling behind. When the time comes for a test or a quiz the student has absolutely no idea how to complete the exam. Consequently failing the exam, and possibly end with a failing grade for the marking period. If the student began online classes there would be a less likely chance of the student failing, because they have designated times to spend playing with friends and for school work. The student still has the possibility of being distracted but the possibility has lessened because they have less room for distractions. This results in a better performance of the student for example, their grades could improve.

In conclusion attending school from home has many perks that your student could benefit from. Not every student is the same, but every student has possibly experienced negative situations that could be avoided by attending online school. Online school and video conferencing helps your child become independent, diligent, and hard working. Every student can benefit from more sleep, less distractions, and strategies that help students stay on task. Overall every student can benefit from this method in many ways; It is easy efficient and straight to the point and it puts less stress on teachers and parents.",5,Distance learning,Independent
1308F5C3347E,"Students would benefit from being able to attend classes by way of video confrencing or of online resources. Not everyone who wants to take the class may not be able to physically take the class as a result of too many other students. Students may also work efficently when they are in their own work enviroments. Lastly, if a student needs help but is too shy to get help or doesn't have enough time in the day to get help from a teacher, an online class can give them the help that they need.

Sometimes students feel as if they can work better when they are not at school. Students may feel like the home or another workspace enviroment is comftorable and may fit all their needs. They are not restricted by the rules of the classroom and can take breaks whenever they feel like it. If they are too sick to go to school or are travelling they can still get work done and not get left behind. At home they may be more relaxed than whatever they get in the classroom. Students would be able to feel more in control of how they work and their own work ethic, both of which they may never have gotten in school.

Class sizes are usually limited and not everyone who registers for a class can take be enrolled. There are always students who wanted to take a class but were unable to get in that class and are forced to take it next year on account of losing another class oppurtunity. The students who are unable to get in that class are usually forced to take a class that they wouldn't have done so otherwise. With taking that same class online many more students can take it and have complete access to all the resources they would need. This means that students would not have to take classes that they had no interest in and are able to take all the classes they want the next year.

Students who are too shy or can't get help would be greatly benefitted by online classes. In schools shy students may never talk or not be able to get help from a teacher and therefore their grades suffer. Online they may have a better chance at one-on-one time with their instructors to get the help they need. By way of video conferencing many students can help eachother out and therefore not take the group work out of school learning. If they can't get in touch with their teacher, students still have the entire internet at their disposal. Students will be able to acess forums, databases, and videos filled with the answers to all their problems. Students who were originally unable to get the help they required would now be able to gain the necessary concepts required for that specific topic.

In conclusion giving students an option for distance learning would be beneficial to their careers. This way of learning would be able to provide better learning enviroments for students. It would also allow students who would not have been able to be in the class, the ability to still be in the class. Students who wouldn't have been able to get help from a teacher would be able to get all the help they would need by way of online or video conferencing.  ",4,Distance learning,Independent
5E5507D2C91E,"In this modern era of easy access to technology, children are heavily influenced by the electronic world into which they immerse themselves. Thus, the younger generations are growing more familiar and comfortable with technology than their own parents and grandparents will ever be. In well-endowed school districts, students often have Chromebooks, Macs, or another brand of a small, portable laptop. It becomes easier to teach students with online material when each and every child has his or her own school-issued device, and other schools have gone as far as to implement distance-learning, a form of education offered through the accessibility of technology. Distance-learning, while heavily reliant on electricity and technology, is greatly beneficial to students because it would both allow those who are not able to attend school due to sickness and reach those who live far away from a learning institution.

Sickness spreads easily in a crowded, public environment where many tools, like pencils, scissors, and desks are shared. Students often cannot afford to miss school due to illness, so they will attend anyway, no matter the severity of their sickness. Even with the addition of laptops into education, missing a day of learning has the potential to impact student learning because he or she is not present for the teacher's lecture and explanation of material. Through distance-learning, students who are sick would be able to connect with the class and teacher in real-time and be able to ask questions to further his or her understanding. If the student was in the hospital, having come down with a more serious illness, like pneumonia, he or she would likely miss out on a few concepts from class but later video chat with a teacher while simultaneously not missing out on medical attention.

Students who live far away from their school would also benefit from in-home learning. Those who live in more rural parts of a school district often have an early wake-up call for a long commute riddled with morning rush-hour traffic. Then, in school, the student is already mentally exhausted and must prepare for the long trek home. Distance learning would eliminate the commute for faraway students, saving them money in gasoline and time in transit. They would also not need to wake up as early and go to bed as late, allowing for a healthier sleep schedule. Many students take part in before- or after-school activites, like a sport. Elite swimmers practice before the sun comes up each morning, hurry off to school for a few hours of learning, then head back to the pool for a second practice or weight routine. Balancing athletics, school, and sleep can prove difficult, especially during end-of-season competitions that run during school days or weeks. But with distance-learning, student-athletes would be able to catch up on missed work while they were absent and have the oppurtunity to ask their teachers questions when they return.

However, distance-learning is not a perfect solution; it sets up a heavy dependence on electricity and wireless connectivity. In times of inclement weather, like a thunderstorm, high winds, or heavy ice, power lines can be knocked out, disconnecting students reliant on their laptop to learn. While inclement weather always carries with it the chance of a school cancellation, some school districts are more prepared for such catastrophes. For example, Minnesota and New York are often slammed with horrendous snowstorms that bring several feet of snow, but these northern states come prepared, bringing their snowplows out in full force and working around the clock to ensure that the roads are safe. Students who live in areas of extreme temperatures and weather are prepared to brave the dangers of the outside. So, students learning from remote areas will then be missing out because are unable to learn, while those physically in school will continue on unaffected. Furthermore, learning at home can prove difficult for those who find it hard to focus. Going to school provides a different, somewhat unfamiliar environment in which students are not constantly distracted by everything. At home, the television, fridge, and bed can all take students' focus from learning. Students who decide to learn from home ought to be dedicated, keep themselves engaged in their virtual classrooms, and able to ignore the pulls of the soft bed with fluffy pillows and the fridge with its store of delicious food.

Distance-learning will provide another option for students who are otherwise unable to learn in the traditional classroom setting. It will be not for the lazy but rather the driven, responsible, and committed, since not everyone possesses the level of focus required to drown out the sounds of distraction. Technology has become easy to use and relatively inexpensive, and as a result, it has introduced options that previously did not exist. In the world of education, techonology will increase the quality of learning for those everywhere. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
30C58EE38D16,"Students in modern day face many challenges in their education. Many people have had creative ideas on how to remove these problems from the lives of all students. For example, many kids do not eat breakfast before school because of financial problems, so schools give out free breakfasts to students to make them more attentive and productive. One new idea states that schools should offer distance learning. This means that some students would have the opportunity to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing with their school. Although some people believe that allowing students to attend classes from home would benefit the students by making education more accessible to students who are farther from the school, offering distance learning would not benefit students because distance learning makes education very expensive, harder to understand, and have less social aspects.

Firstly, distance learning would not benefit students because it makes education very expensive. Many students rely on the free technology supplied by the school, such as laptops and calculators, for their education. This is important for students who would not be able to afford computers and calculators, and puts all students on an even field for learning. But a new wave of expenses would occur if students could take online classes. Firstly, the technology needed would have an astoundingly high cost. The school would have to buy many new monitors for their classrooms. The school would have to buy microphones for all of the teachers so that the students to be able to hear the lessons. Keeping all of these expensive pieces of technology running require a massive amount of chargers. Technicians would need to be hired in order to fix all the problems in the computers, and the school would generate a large electrical bill. Many expenses also apply to students. While students would be able to use their school computers to watch lessons from their home, they would have to buy their own microphones and chargers. Secondly, one central component of technology is a strong internet connection. Many schools have a free internet connection that students are allowed to use while they are at school. If students needed to use their computers from home for their entire education, they would require a strong connection to the internet. Many people who rely on the supplied technology and internet access from the school are not able to pay for fast internet access at their homes. Students with a poor connection at their homes would receive a poor connection to the lesson, and would not be able to fully understand the information that the rest of the class was given. These costs create an expensive alternative for both the school and the students that not everyone would be able to pay for.

Secondly, distance learning would not benefit students because it make the information harder to understand. Schools and classrooms create a learning environment that makes receiving help easy and cuts out distractions. If students watch the classes from their homes, their learning environment has neither of those. Firstly, students would have a much more difficult time asking questions and receiving help. If the student does not buy a microphone, they would not be able to talk to the teacher and would have to explain questions through emails. This way of communication is much less effective because neither side would be able to explain themselves as well as they could in real life. Secondly, homes have many more distractions than classrooms, which can affect how well the students focus. In a classroom it is mostly quiet, and distractions such as talking, using phones, and listening to music are banned. This makes the students pay attention to the teacher and the lesson. While at home the students can not be monitored as closely because the teacher is not able see what they are doing. Many noises such as traffic and people outside can distract the minds of the students. With the combined lack of supervision and many distractions, students that learn from home can never learn as well as students that learn at school. Thirdly, many scientists, colleges, and organizations have studied the factors that contribute to an efficient learning. One main result that almost all researchers can agree upon is that students remember things better when they write information down. Many teachers agree with this and make their students write their notes down on paper. Students in a distance learning program would not have to write down their notes because their teachers would not be able to see if they had or not. Students who learn from school are able to better understand their material due to many factors that students at home do not have.

Thirdly, distance learning would not benefit students because it has less social aspects. Social activities include sports, clubs, and student organizations, and also friends. It is important for students to have a balance between their educational and social lives. Without them, students would be less interested in school. Students who attend school online do not have these opportunities.

Most colleges look for students who have both good grades and good social lives in their communities. Having both a strong education and a strong social presence in their community shows to colleges that the student is able to function well in the world and will be more likely to succeed.

In conclusion, students who attend classes from home have a large learning disadvantage because the program makes education expensive, harder to understand, and without social aspects. If more students use distance learning programs it will only resolve in a poorer school and a poorly educated youth. I hope that students will make the smart decision for both them and their community, and continue to learn in a productive environment that will educate them properly.",6,Distance learning,Independent
46A196DFB54F,"Do students have lees benefit if they attend school?

As we can see teenagers have many option some of them to attend class everyday, but some schools let teenager to choose if they want to stayed in home while they are having class online or video conferencing with a teacher, What benefits teenagers have if they stayed in home?

Those students who attend school they have wake up early and they don't have to miss school or they are going to miss a lot of information from days that they are absent some of them dropout from school early because they feel pressure we all this things and they don't have the opportunities to graduate, Also another thing the school is to far from their home and they not want to walk or waiting in the bus stop cause sometimes the buses came late and they think that time is wasting or they got a problems in school and they don't want to come but still graduate to have a better future. students have many reason why they always choose to take classes in online.

Most of the parents thinks that is better idea that their children takes the classes from home because they feel is more safe for them and they can be out trouble and be caution at whatever situation in the school can happen ,they can graduate more easily and fast .Parents always look for the good of their children they always thinks what would to happen to them if they are not inside of the house who can hurt them in school, parents thinks is more easily for them.

Teachers said that those teenagers who takes classes in online they can get more lazy and maybe they don't know what they doing cause students always need an adult to help them to understands and explain the topics or problems that they have to solve, Also they think if students attend school they develop much better and are more prepare and discover more than the things that they already know.

Most of the people agree that students have the same benefits if they take the online class because is the things that school teach to a every single students,Also we have people who disagree for the reason that they have to pay for those classes and think they are wasting money for no reason because they have public school that can teach them and not paying nothing so they can graduate and can go to college or the university .

Every single person has a different opinion about taking class from home and their benefits is we looking we are going to know that is the same thing if we pay attention and be careful what we are doing we can reach the goal that we want and make that same thing that we do in school just little different but always is going to be the same benefits. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
5D67E6FF363D,"Schools have been providing online classes for students very recently. The number of students attending schools have risen up because of this feature. Individuals are able to be present and learning wherever they may be during an online course. Students will greatly benefit from taking online courses because they are able to stay in a comfortable environment, have a greater number of resources, and they are able to learn at their own pace.

Home is where comfort lies within learning. Being able to learn in a comfortable environment is what a lot of sessions at a school lack. School is supposed to be mainly about learning, but most people find it extremely difficult to focus because of the others around them. Home is a place where no one will judge one another or have to worry about anything other than the task at hand. Some people say that working at home is not a great place because of the distractions of electronics. In regards to that, people are able set those electronics away from them or give them to their guardians to help them focus entirely. It allows for a reward at the end of their studies to be present for motivation to continue to work as well. I was given the opportunity to be able to take an online lesson in high school for Pre-Calculus. I was able to have less distractions from being around others during this time, This allowed for greater results on the quiz later in the quarter.

Backpacks are not able to carry everything a student might need for all of their classes. This is why students have to pick and choose what can go with them and what can't. By taking online classes, students are able to have their desired resources right by them. I was able to use all my materials that I possessed when learning online. Materials, such as textbooks and notebooks that I was not able to keep in my bag, were able to grant a greater understanding of the lesson. For an essay, I knew there was an instance of that prompt in an old book I read, but

I did not have that book with me to be able to do that part during class time. This caused for a invaluable use of time during the class because I was not able to use everything I would've been able to if I were taking an online course.

School teachers tend to go at the pace of the class' average. Everyone doesn't have the same learning speed, so most people need more or less time to master the topic that was given. Online classes give you the ability of spending as much time needed for each of the topics by watching the lesson over again. My younger brother takes online lessons since he is faster at learning topics online than in class. It allows for him to spend less time learning the same things he already understands online, while asking about new things during class time.

Online courses are beneficial for students because of the familiar working space, they'll have plenty of materials available to them, and their personal learning pace is able to be utilized. Working in a comfortable, familiar environment allows for a student to stay focused on what they need to accomplish. By having all the materials students might need for an assignment, their quality of learning and work tend to rise. Pacing is extremely important for one's understanding of a topic as a whole. Courses that are given online are very useful in a mastery of a subject overall.",5,Distance learning,Independent
667499205A97,"Schools should offer online classes or video conferences because students could do their work when they're not at school, and it would save the school money; however, there would be a higher chance of them cheating.

First, if the student is not able to get to school, they could do there work at home. Sometimes, students also have family vacations during school; therefore, the students could work on vacation. My friend Generic_Name misses school all the time because of family events. Generic_Name's school offers online classes, which means Generic_Name can turn in his work even though he is not at school. Students would have more time to complete their work since they can do it after school. Students would be more likely to turn in their work with the extra time they have to finish it; the students would then have better grades and actually be able to keep their grades high.

Secondly, online classes would save the school money. Schools that have some classes that only online could save money because they would not need to hire more teacher. That means the school would have ore money to improve the school itself and make the online classes more effective. Schools could even charge a small fee for online classes, so that way the school would be making a small profit. Generic_Name's school has managed to buy all kinds of new equipment for charging for online classes, for example: laptops, desk, gym equipment, snack vending machines, desk, and chairs. Generic_Name's school still has extra money to spend on the classes.

However, it would be easier for students to cheat on assignments. Students have access to more website at home than when they are at school. They could also get someone else to do their work for them. Most of the time schools probably won't realize the student has cheated. If the schools buy the students laptops; they could block access to some websites, therefore, making it harder to cheat and easier to see what websites the students are viewing.

In conclusion, schools should have online classes because students could do their work at home, and it would save the school money; however it's easier for students to cheat. Having online classes would be very helpful to school. It would bring in a small income and allow more kids to learn. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
D1ACADAC5ED4,"School is not exactly something everyone looks forward to nowadays. Teenagers are depressed, anxious, and some incredibly sick. It is so difficult to avoid some of the negative things in life when a student is constantly surrounded by peer pressure and bullying. If given the choice, many students would most likely choose to skip school and stay at home. However, if a student was given the option to attend classes from home, it would be beneficial. This is because it allows those who get sick to stay caught up and protects those who get bullied and assaulted in school.

First, online classes by way of video conference are very helpful to those who are sick because they are still able to be taught by a teacher. Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a ""normal"" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids.

Video conferences and attending classes online are also beneficial to a different demographic, those who are bullied and assaulted. To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn't happen to them again. The book

Speak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn't done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do.

Some may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. But, everyone has people they interact with outside of school. Whether it be in the neighborhood or at church, there are many other ways to get your social fix in. Take home-schooled kids, for example. They might be home alone all day trying to get their schoolwork done, but home-schooled students have these groups called co-ops. These co-ops are groups of other students that are home-schooled that come to learn altogether. This helps those who are home-schooled get themselves some time with other students.

There are many benefits to having another option for students who are sick and kids who get assaulted and bullied. Many of today's societal issues, whether it be new illnesses spreading or more and more students getting hurt and going to school in fear, affect a teenager's school life. The less focused we are on the issues going on outside of school, the more we are able to focus on what could impact our future. School is vital to our future in today's world, and the administration needs to realize that there are things taking away our focus from school. Teenagers are the future of this world, and the past generations need to realize that things are different that they were in their time. Would you want your children to go to school living in fear? Well, they already are.",6,Distance learning,Independent
EB29E13CF6D7,"With the increasing use of technology in our modern society, we are able to communicate with people all around the world and create a united global community.

But with all the technological advances in today's society we often tend to stray away from our more traditonal practices. One example that comes to mind is school, with technology and the internet becoming more accessable to others, schools are now considering offering online classes that students can take at home. While some might support this idea, arguing that the comfort of home creates the perfect environment for students to learn. I have to disagree.

I feel that distance learning would not benefit students. While I do agree that a home setting would make students feel comfortable, it can be argued that comfort was never a necessity when learning. We come to school to be in a learning environment full of discomforts that keep us on edge and focused, we are rarely ever relaxed. As I am writing this right now there is a student next to me who keeps chewing very audibly on his finger nails. It is in this situation that I am more motivated to finish my work and to get out of this room, as he is making me very uncomfortable.

But to only base my argument on one aspect of my learning environment would be foolish. We must also consider the distractions we may have at home. While our schools and classrooms are designed to have minimal distractions in them, our homes are not. Often times I find myself sitting in my room trying to do my homework, but more often than not, I am distracted by objects that are cluttered on my desk. Now you could say that this argument is very situation based, but there are plenty of other things that I can list off. Things like family, friends, pets, and cell phones. There is also the fact that there are no teachers at home to keep us in check so that we don't get distracted. As a student with a learning disability, I often find that my ADHD pulls my attention away from my work. But never in my twelve years of being in the education system, have I found myself more distracted in a school setting, than a home setting.

There is also a problem with the way of learning that online classes mandate. By looking at a screen and reading or watching videos, students aren't as engaged as they would be if they had a class discussion or socratic seminar. Students learn not only by teachers, but also by sharing ideas with each other and building upon what their peers say. One of the best ways of learning is through communication and sharing ideas. I specifically love learning this way as it is what a real world setting would look like. A group of minds that either agree or disagree on a topic all coming together to rationalize and create one centeralized idea. The kind of learning where all a teacher has to do is stir our minds so that we may learn on our own. A computer can't do that, all it can do is collect information, not create. We do not learn from computers, all we do is relay the information that is given to us, that isn't learning, it's just memory. Online classes do nothing but exchange the experience of learning and coming to school for the comfort of staying home.

While I do feel that technology has tremendously improved the learning experience for students, I feel that too much of it could end up hurting more than helping. The problem with computers is that they all ""think"" the same way, while students evidently do not. You just can't replace the learning relationship between a student and teacher, or a student and their peers, with something that is artificial. You cannot replace the perfect learning environment filled with simplicity, for one that is littered with distractions. Finally, you cannot recreate the discomfort of audible chewing noises, in an environment that was tailored specifically to comfort you.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent
51EF8C7D4263,"Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend class from home, because they can be responsible to attend classed from home, always learn new things, and always study.

First of all, be responsible to attend classes from home because there is a lot of people that are not responsible on their education especially attending classes from home. For instance, someone being home school needs responsibility.

Second of all, students always learn new things while they are being attended classed from home. For instance, while they are paying attention on the things they are teaching to the student theirs always new things to learn and interesting things to know what is about.

Third of all, always study on the things they might ask you on. For instance, you might take quizzes just to know how much you know on the things you learned.

Finally, get your work done on time so you can be able to pass and start on new things. For instance, if you don't get your work done on time you will be behind and not be able to pass on the new things to learn.

In conclusion, some people think it would not benefit students being able to attend classes from home because they won't be responsible, always going to forget, and not doing what they are suppose to do.                  ",2,Distance learning,Independent
6.15E+11,"You ever wonder if there are any benefits on being home schooled? Schools are offering students the option to be able to take their courses from home but what good does it do? In reality, having students attend a school is a far better option. By having students attend a school they are able to gain social, collaborative, and different learning skills.

Being able to gain social skills will ultimately helps one's life. By attending a school Students are able to break out of their shell and be able to express themselves in many different ways. Presentations would build their communication skills that could help them in the future for a job interview or a meeting at work. Students would start to get comfortable with the idea of presenting to an audience and would get to speak to them without an issue. Schools also allow students the opportunity to meet different types of students that might end up being their friends. From past experiences having someone to be with throughout a school year is honestly a great moment. Not only do students get to have fun and be kids but they get to watch each other mature, which would strengthen their bond. Students are able to build off of experiences they have went through or from others so they could grow from them and try to better themselves.

Collaborative skills is a great ability for students to have. Schools do provide the opportunity for students to grow their collaborative ability and make it their own. For example, there is a high school course called ""AVID"" which teaches students to use their collaborative skills for questions they dont understand. Students ask questions that might lead them to find an understanding of how the question should be answered. Students also do a lot of presentations with group members for college researches. AVID's main goal for students is to frequently ask questions that they might be confused about. As I mentioned earlier, students being able to work in groups really allows them grow in being able to take a role in their work. Their leadership skills would also be developed giving them responsibility.

A school's teaching ability would improve a student's life by them learning how to build their skills and how would students apply them to their everyday lives.

Schools provide different learning experiences students may benefit from. It is known that each teacher has their own way of teaching their class. Some students may not like the way certain teachers teach but those are usually the ones that stand out the most. By having students struggle in a class they are improving their rigor. Taking rigorous classes would improve their learning skills which students could apply for other classes. Also, students could learn different learning methods from their teachers. Some teachers may have their own methods that may be easier and less time consuming. But, there are students that may have a hard time to be in that sort of situation. There are students that may face mental health issues that may be the reason why they are considering being home schooled. Students may not be able to handle a classroom environment, which is a good reason for them to have their course be taken at home. It would benefit students being able to learn in a comfortable environment for them.

In conclusion, allowing students to attend a school environment would benefit their lives in many ways. Schools do provide students an environment where they could benefit in the future is the school's main goal. Students are able to experience many different events that could change their lives for the better. Schools do provide the platform for students to be able to live a successful life. Schools are meant to lead future generations to become far greater than the previous so why change that now? ",5,Distance learning,Independent
82F7210163B5,"When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.         ",4,Distance learning,Independent
AAEED47072D9,"I believe students would not benefit from attending classes from home. Students need to be with a teacher when they need help, they should not have to set up a video conference just to receive help. Also, having other students in the classroom to help with work and projects is a plus of going to school everyday. Students should not attend classes at home since there isn't a true benefit in doing so.

Students need to be with a teacher when they need help, they shouldn't have to set up a video conference. Most students need a teacher at all times during a class period so they can explain in depth the topics that are being discussed. Having a teacher explain right in front of you is easier for myself and many other students. For example, if a student needed help outside of their scheduled class time, how would they reach the teacher without disrupting their other classes that they are teaching? There wouldn't be a possible way for a student to get a hold of their teacher without causing any disruptions.

Having other students in front of you that would help with work and projects is also a plus of going to school everyday. Getting a students perspective on different assignments and projects could actually save your grade. Sometimes you just need a little encouragement from your peers to get you through your assignments. Let's say a teacher assigned a project due the same night and allowed you to work with a partner to help get it done. How would you easily be able to communicate with your partner enough to get all of the work done before the due date? It would be really hard to do so over the phone or through a video conference. All in all, having someone to communicate with and help you with different assignments and projects is the difference between your grade.

Overall, there is not a benefit for students that attend classes at home or through a video conference. The students would not have a teacher that would be available to help them throughout the day or students to help with assignments and relate to them. Although others would believe that having students taking classes is a great idea and that they would benefit from the classes since they would be easier to complete at home, they are incorrect. Students need a challenge sometimes, so why would we have them work from home just because it is an easier option for them? We need to stop holding these children back since we know they can do better. We should not always jump to take the easy way out.",4,Distance learning,Independent
363F69979EAB,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home of way of online or video conferencing. There's an ongoing debate over if students should or should not attend classes from home. There are those who argue that students should attend classes from home, but they are wrong. Although some may disagree, students should not attend classes from home.

There are a variety of reasons why students should not permitted to attend classes from home. As a student in high school I understand that it is hard to make friends, so by going to school with other students I, like other students, have been developing these social skills that will be needed in the future. Throughout my years schooling there are multiple events that the students will have to show these set of skills: presentations, speeches, projects, all things that will never be experienced from at home schooling. With social skills there are people, and interacting with them can be joyful, when having a good time. Students at my school enjoy spending time with each other during sport practice especially. Practice for sports or electives are entertaining because you get time to do something that interest you and some time to relax from a stressful day at school. When apart of a team, band, or choir there are games and performances that are not able to be taken part of when home schooled.

There are additional reasons why students should not attend classes from home. All students have a different learning tactic, for myself it is through music. Not all student can be home schooled because they are not able to learn through a computer and fully understand the lesson being taught. When this occurs the student is expects to contact a teacher which is not always possible. When I am in need of help with a lesson in my classroom I can simply walk up to my teacher and get clarification on the lesson; however, when you are home schooled it is not that easy to where you can do that.

Even though some may disagree, students should not be allowed to take classes from home. Students should be prohibited from taking classes at home because they can not develop social skills, may not be able to get the extra help needed, can not experience taking electives and being in programs. There are those who argue that students should be able to take class from home, but this is not true. Ultimately, students should be able to experience school with other students and make memories that will be cherished.",4,Distance learning,Independent
BE0B394B4E9B,"For as long as they could remember, students have been attending school by following a structural path of their personal education. They take classes that teach them basic principles that they will contribute to their every day lives, as well as the future. As the world progresses in advancement, technology has played a vital role in expanding the education system. Some schools now offer an option for students to attend classes from their own home by online or video conferencing. This innovative and modern policy has been heavily debated upon if it is the right move for students to further their educational career. Although some may argue that distance learning may increase laziness for students, having them able to attend classes from home would overall benefit students by creating a comfortable environment, improving learning styles and creativity, as well as preparing them for college and future jobs.

Students spend a majority of their day at school and become aware of their certain surroundings. They understand their school dynamic and environment, which contributes a vital role in their education. If a student is uncomfortable with the environment that is represented throughout the school, it will make them dread coming to school and unmotivated to learn. Students spend around seven hours of their day at school, and if they are in an hostile habitat, it will negatively impact their education. By forcing students to stay in a place where they do not feel comfortable, it will deprive them of the knowledge and experience they could be receiving. Having students work from home would allow them to create their own safe space that they will learn better in. They would be in a comfortable environment that they themselves are used to, and can prosper in. Online classes would benefit students by giving them the choice to leave an environment where they feel limited, for a place that they know would allow them to learn effectively.

Every student is different, and they all know what methods they personally learn best from. Teachers at school often disregard this, and they go on to teach all of their students the same way. They have no choice but to implement this, due of the vast amount of students they have and the deadlines of curriculum. This way of educating limits the potential of students, as they are constricted to one way of learning. By giving students the opportunity to take online courses, they would be able to practice the learning style they know is best fitted for them. This will overall lead to better retention and understanding of the work that is being asked of them. Students know themselves, and they know what works for them in regards to learning certain materials. This freedom of education will also promote creativity and allow them to come up with new ways and projects for themselves. By allowing students to take these online courses, they would be able to learn effectively and broaden their horizons of ideas.

Students go to school to learn ideals that they will one day use in the future for their own well being. Everything that is taught to them is meant to build their knowledge and invent new ways of innovation for themselves, as well as society. By having students attend their classes from home, it will prepare them for the college and work experience that is set out for them. In college, students work on assignments on their own digital devices and submit them to their professors online. This is how they learn and build off of their knowledge, a concept that could be taught at an earlier age through the developments of online classes. In addition, with the speed at which technology is developing, most jobs will ask their employees to have technological knowledge and skills. This will put students at a greater chance of obtaining these jobs with the online experience they have. By having students take up on distance learning, they will become better equipped for the future that is ahead of them.

Many may argue that online classes will make students more lazy and likely to procrastinate their work. Though in hindsight, these online courses will further teach students how to schedule their time and effort on their assigned projects. These students know what will happen if they procrastinate their assignments, and through this they are better prepared to finish their work with the resources available to them. Online classes will even give students the opportunity to get ahead of their work, since they are not following the same schedule the courses taught at the school go.

A student's education is very important, and it is emphasized on being a fundamental building block of their own life. By implementing the choice of online classes, students would be able to take themselves out of hostile environment for somewhere they know they could learn in. They would be able to explore different learning styles that they know are best suited for them, which goes to spark creativity in the work they put out. Online courses would also give students the opportunity to jump start on their future and build habits that will benefit them for college and the work force. By having schools offer distance learning, their students would be able to prosper in ways that will benefit them for the rest of their educational career.",6,Distance learning,Independent
548EC5B339E3,"When we talk about technology and ways to improve our life, What is the first think that come to our minds: Cell phones, computers, internet etc. However technology is also present in the field of the medicine, food daily life etc. Now you think that technology is Just cell phones computers and internet.

I'am pretty sure that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because you're attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like.

Student would get benefits in many ways. If they study from home and if they also go to the normal school they can graduate much early than the usual. They can find a job too, if they organize their time wisely. If they have a job so they could earn money and they can use to pay college.

If some student ask me I obviously recommend them to take online classes, it is a good way to improve your weakness and also you are going to be more success.

My conclusion is yes student get benefits in many ways when they take classes from home. and I think that every school should have the option to choose if the students wants to take online classes, and also is a good idea to help the student to be more success in the life.

6E5F280580C4,"Should some school offer distance learning for students to attendend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.

One reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. It's for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work.

The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.

Some people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

In conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
6DADC0DF0C87,"I believe all students should have the option to enroll in distance learning. In my case, I prefer distance learning because I have trouble focusing in a classroom environment. Another plus of distance learning is you get to learn at your own pace and never have to stop for other students. Although distance learning isn't for everyone, I think all schools should offer it because it will be beneficial for many students.

Last year I did a full online school program, and this year I go into school every day but still use a online based system. Since starting distance learning my grades have improved drastically. In public school I always got F's and C's in my classes, I could barely focus and didn't want to stop the whole class when I didn't understand a concept. I never wanted to stay after school to get help from the teacher because that would take extra time out of my day. Once I started computer schooling I could instantly focus better and take brakes when I needed to reset my brain. Being able to work at my own pace is another thing I love about distance learning. I have been able to work a lot faster and complete my classes sooner and with better grades. One main reason I switched to distance learning was to make more time for other things such as my job, and relieving stress I had about school.

I think everybody should be offered distance learning as an option because other students may be struggling as I was in public schooling. However, distance learning is not for everyone. Distance learning can take discipline because you don't have a teacher to bug you when you are not getting your work done. Other students may have the discipline it takes, but prefer a teacher to learn from rather than reading or watching a video online. I think online schooling can help relieve the stress many students face in public schooling. I know first hand that getting the homework turned in, doing poorly on a test, or not getting time to do things you enjoy can be very stressful. Some students may also struggle with social issues such as bullying, where distance learning can help them get away from a toxic environment.

In conclusion, I believe all students should have the option to enroll in distance learning. Distance learning may not be right for some people, but I think it would benefit a large amount of students. Many teens struggle with the stress coming from the social and educational aspects of school, I believe distance learning can relieve this stress. Distance learning can free up time in your day so you have more time for things you enjoy doing. ",4,Distance learning,Independent

FF678908A963,"How would a student feel if they were able to attend classes from home? Happy? Or sad? In the 21st Century, people around the world are surrounded by possibilities, like online school, which could advance themselves as human beings. Attending online school will increase the level of security for students and staff, it will advance a students' studies, and will create an outlet for students to better express themselves.

When people oppose this idea of having online school, they tend to argue the fact that, students attending these classes from home will be socially undeveloped. Though this is a possibility among the few, opposers of this idea have to look at the great benefits to having schools of this domain available: a child will not experience physical bullying; students are able to learn more material by asking questions in an environment they know is safe; staff and students will be able to learn and grade at a pace that is best to meet their deadline for assignments.

Having to attend classes from home will greatly benefit both parties of students and staff. Over the past years, there have been multiple school shootings that happen randomly. Whether these shootings have to deal with personal or academic problems, schools can never ensure that a student nor a teacher will be safe at all times. To better make sense of things, being able to attend school from home could mean that a student will have a lower fatality rate because of the higher level of security they have at their home. Being a student who takes a virtual course, having the opportunity to learn at home means that I can keep my guard down and not have to worry about school shooters of any kind.

To further add on to the benefits, being able to attend classes from home could mean that a student can advance in their studies. Since a student is not on a strict schedule, they can set themselves up for success by establishing their own. When teaching with a physical class, teachers are inhibiting a students' success by holding up the class to answer questions instead of continuing with the planned lesson. Having the flexibility to speed up and slow down in a course could mean a great deal to the success of a students' future.

Similarly to advancing in their studies, students will also be able to foster an outlet where they will be better at expressing their emotions and social skills. Surrounded by their family members and neighbors, a student can better prepare themselves for the real world by applying new skills they learn by attending classes from home. For example, if a student were to take a Public Speaking course online from home, they will be better adapted to their environment, and will be able to perform at their best because they acknowledge the encouragement their family members and neighbors give to them.

Life grants people of all backgrounds the possibility to grow. People of the contemporary world should not be afraid of modernity or advancement for their children. There is only one life to live, and it is best to revel in it, which is justifies the notion that students would in fact benefit from being able to attend classes from home.",4,Distance learning,Independent
0A5299390319,"Learning helps you understand better, and it's the way of life. Everybody goes to school and learn, but other peoples stay home and learn. Students that made the decision to stay home and learn is doing what's best for them; especially if they are not comfortable going to school. In my belief learning from home does benefit because students can graduate faster, sick children are still able to learn, and students would be successful in future life.

Many students that are going to school are tired. I am a student that has been going to school for many of years; I am pretty much tired and exhausted! That is why I am taking online classes to finish my classes. Taking online classes helps a lot, mostly if students wants to finish school and get it over with. I am not going to lie school is so stressful. Finishing all the classes that we need and have enough credits, that is a mission accomplished. It makes us feel good and have that motivation to keep going forward with school, and by then we would reach our goals.

We have graduated early and it our decision on what we want to do with our life, some people may want to go to early college, or some people choose to chase their dream. Whatever keep us motivated we will keep going. That keeps us happy because we do things that want us to be motivated, and only way to get it over with is, taking online classes to graduate early.

It aches to hear people doubting other people just because they are sick. Sick people can still learn. Its not like they are some one else. For example, as a child I love to learn, it made me feel good about myself, but I was sick. And everyone thinks that because I was sick I won't be able to learn anything, I was left behind. It made me feel upset that I won't be able to learn like other children. It had me feeling down, so I told my mom I want to learn, I want to keep going to school. I had that motivation as a child that learning keeps me happy and understand the world I'm in. It helps me learn new things everyday. It made me feel so good about myself! I started home bounds; it is a program that students can still able to learn in any condition. I would video call my teachers every week days and learn. It made me feels so good, and look at where I am! I am happy where I have came, school can be stressful. But it helps me feel happy and focus on that task, expect of worrying about things that would upsets me. Video conferencing benefited me and it helps me where I am at today.

A way of being successful in life is to learn. A student that is passionate to finish school early and go on to chase their career is successful in life. Anyone can do what they want in life if they put effort to it. Taking online classes helps a lot, it benefit students. It keeps them happy on what they have chosen to do with their own life. Finish the classes and graduate early, see the real world behind them. Look what they want in life. Students want to see who they are,they want to chose who they want to be. Its their decision on what they want to be. For example, I remember reading a book about chasing dreams, a dream can't be chased if you haven't finish the important things in life, like school. Taking online classes would helps a lot. Do it and finish everything, and get it out of the way. Once we did the important things, chase the dream we want. It would be easier in life to get important things out of the way. And we don't have to worry about anything and just follow whatever that we wants to be.

In conclusion, attending classes from home by taking online classes, or video conferencing does benefits students. It helps students to graduate faster, it keeps sick student to still learn, and students to be successful in life on who they want to be. Without having a choice of taking online classes or video conferencing, students would not have any choices of how to get their education, it would be a whole mess.            ",4,Distance learning,Independent
32D3B300954A,"Schools are now starting to provide new methods of students being able to learn. With having school at home there is many benefits and cons about it. Students now have more ways to go to school and get a education that maybe they weren't able to get before. I think that students wouldn't really benefit from taking classes from home because they are more distractions, the student would probably will be on their phone, and the lack of communication with others.

Distractions become more noticeable at home because there are loads of things that could distract you. For example, if your taking your classes in the living room, the TV might be on or you're attempted to go watch TV. Another example, could be that your in the kitchen and you happen to start eating and you happen to take a break from your class. I honesty think that if you take classes from home it's a waste of time.

These almost everyone has a phone and even now at schools everyone is on them. I think that the with being home and having classes the phone will be like one of the main problem because of how addicting it is. For example during a session you get a call or text and your mind gets preoccupied with that text or call that you receive. It also takes away time from learning because if your constantly on the phone you aren't paying attention to whats happening.

Another reason that I think that we don't really benefit is that theres a lack of communication with other people. Having good communication skills is important to have because you might need it for a future job. With taking online or video conferences it sort of helps with that but not fully. It's more beneficial that they go to a public or private school because they are different types of people and you get more experience on the communication. For example, with doing a video conference most likely you'll be talking to the same teacher every day, while going to school somewhere you won't talk to the same one or couple of people.

With all being said, students should attend school instead of taking classes at home because of all the distractions, phones being in the way, and of lack of communication. Even though I might think a certain way, you shouldn't just take all my advice, many people happen to learn or educate themselves in different ways. I would like to thank whomever is reading this and thank them for the effort they put into reading this. By the way never stop learning in the long run it helps out a lot.      ",4,Distance learning,Independent
4.31E+11,"Why they are think studnets should have classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? Many of the studnets home is to far and maybe can't come or is come let. Every schools should have this option for students. This is make easy for some students.

First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body can't make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he can't do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school.

Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you don't have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you can't find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesn't have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor.

Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class. Some teachers go to students home for the teaching just for one student and focuse to just one student. For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me.

Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses.

Some students, need go school for the understand better. Some students need go school because if they are stay in home and they want home schools maybe in not listen to teacher or make copy. For friendly some people is unsocial and need make friend in school. Ithink school good option for this studnets.",2,Distance learning,Independent
6DF747F4A277,"Some schools offer students to attend classes from home by being online. Therefore, students would be able to still learn while at home. Some people think that this offer does not benefit students. However, I think that this helps the students for many reasons. This offer can help with sick days, students who don't like to attend school, and less makeup work for students.

Students miss work and new lessons while at home sick. They can be out of school for a long period of time depending on their type of illness. Taking classes online or video conferencing can help them keep up with their work while out sick. If some schools do not have classes online for sick students they will most likely fail their classes if not caught up. This can benefit students while being sick at home.

Some students don't like to leave their house to attend school every week. They think it is a waste of time to wake up every morning to go to school. Online classes can help students with their hate towards going to school. To some students, going to school is tiring and stressful to do in the mornings. With online classes they can wake up at anytime to do their lessons with enough rest.

There can be students dealing with different situations at home. It can be anything in their life that causes them to not attend school on a regular basis. Addictionally, they would have a lot of makeup work to do for missing days. So therefore, if students don't have online classes they will have loads of makeup work to do. Makeup work can be stressful to do when the work is hard to understand.

All schools should provide an option to do online classes. Some people say this isn't a good option for students because they might not do their work. But it would be better because they get to choose what is best for them. This way everyone can be satisfied with doing their work.",3,Distance learning,Independent
47CC7361B35B,"Technology is pretty much at teenagers fingertips at all times. When it comes to the latest Tiktok trends,YouTube videos, Google, Instagram and all things in between students are influenced by the internet. Why not use something that most kids in Americans have access to in order to help educate Generation Z and the generations that follow. School is a very important aspect of life that all students should be able to enjoy. For many student school is not. School has become a drain on students mental health. Many kids rather learn more about their future carers,or become an influncers and athletes. The compromise is online school, why not just focus on what students need to know to be productive in life and still give them the opportunity presume different opportunities. Online schooling allows students to wake up later, get an education and are able to be happy and focus on other things. While many say online school is the easy way out in reality it teaches time management and responsibility in order to live out their dreams and helps out kids who miss school on a regular.

Online schooling is a way students can stay on top of their work and not fall behind there classmates. I had a friend freshman year who missed two months of school due to family issues in her home country. Missing that much school required her to stay back another year and retake classes should would have done well in had she not have had a family emergency. Having access to online school she would have been able to follow along with her classmates and still be their for her family. Taking

AP classes is a lot of work and requires you to be there every class. I can not tell you how many times I have come to school with really bad sicknesses so I do not miss notes,quizzes or a test in one those classes. For example I take AP bio every morning, if I miss one class I have missed half a chapter of notes. Which in the long run is a lot of information I now have to learn on my own. Having access to online school I am able to video chat into my classes, take my notes and make up any worksheets I am missing and still have a teacher explain it to me so I can have the full picture and still be able to rest up. While students need a breaks for school sometimes and online school has the possibility of taking that away, online school would be for student who miss 3 or more day and in the long run falling behind and and having a pile of work to come back to hurts so much more than not having a break.

Online school teaches students how to plan around their busy lives and still get their degree. The most common argument for online school is, ""Students will get behind and fail out."" This is true but goes the same way as regular school. If a student misses more than 10 days of school in a row the parents are put on trail for truancy and can be taken to jail. The same should apply to student who choose to learn online. Online school will help keep students on top of their game and still allow them to do the things they enjoy. For students graduating early this helps them do everything required and go to college early. Having fun requires responsibility. Students know if they are not doing well they will have to go back to public school which would be embarrassing for them.

Follow your dreams is a statement many teachers have taught students since kindergarten. How can one follow their dreams when they are required to stay in school for 180 days of the year. This is where online school takes a huge part in. Students are still able to walk across the stage at graduating and do something they are passionate about. Charlie Damelio,and other influncers miss a lot of school due to tours, commercials and brand trips. Online school is their only option. Many people say that kids should not miss school for entertainment purposes, but these kids are building a brand and making money in a capitalistic society. Pulling kids out of school to work on TV shows and movies is not a new concept. How do you think shows like Full House and Boy Meets World were filmed. These kids had to hire teachers to teach them full time and still go to set. Online Schooling is so much better for actors and influncers now because they can do all the requirements their school has and still film. Noah Schnapp, an actor on Stranger Things loves online school because when he is done filming he can go back to school and is not behind. Online school is something that has been brought up in my family recently. My sister does gymnastics and practices 4 hours a day 3 days a week, Her coaches believe she could become a junior Olympian and wants her to practice 5 days a week for 8 hours a day. Thats a huge opportunity for a 13 year old and could help her get into UCLA on a full gymnastics scholarship. Her passion and drive for gymnastics is not at the same level as it is for school. She goes to school and just does what she need to do to pass. Online school is a really good option for her so she is able to do what she loves and get an education.

Another positive of online school is that students are able to work full time and get a degree. Many students must work a 5 hour job and go to school for 8 hours to support their family.

Having the option of school online lets them plan classes around working and still allow them to walk across the stage. Online school is a great substitute for kids who are looking toward becoming famous and making a living at a young age.

Online school allows students to do what they love, not get behind and learn responsibility. This is an amazing tool if used correctly to help student who get sick a lot, who are trying to get famous or trying to start with their careers. With great power comes great responsibility that student are able to learn with this process. Having the option of online school helps improve the way of education for all.          ",6,Distance learning,Independent
83AE9B85F6FD,"The Benefits of Online Schooling

From lack of transportation, disabilities or feeling unsafe, many students are forced to stay home and miss out on valuable learning opportunities. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it revokes the need for transportation routes, allows students with injuries or disabilities to participate and allows students to feel safe while learning.

Many areas and school districts are fortunate enough to provide school parking and bus routes for their students. However, many times students need to make an extraneous effort simply to get transportation to school. Many students in my school district need to be driven to their nearest bus stop to even be able to ride for an hour to attend their local high school. Inclement weather or lack of a ride forces many of my school mates to miss class. These absences can be counteracted with the introduction of online classes. Students will benefit from online courses and curriculum without having to worry about having their transportation needs met. Students will be able to participate in an online classroom and engage with others without having to step out of their own home. Weather or lack of a ride forces many bright students to miss out on critical learning opportunities because of circumstantial needs. These aforementioned situations are common around the country and the introduction of online classes will alleviate these unfortunate absences.

Many schools outside of the country don't provide transportation services similar to the US. Students in Germany take the metro to get to school and many other students are forced to ride trains or local buses to their high schools. This may cause many students to feel unsafe and administer a feeling of fear with going to school. In many cases, girls feel unsafe to ride local buses and trains alone due to fear of sexual assault or kidnap. Rape and sexual assault are horrid things to think about but are often times reality for many females (and males) on public transportation. Online schooling offers a way for students to take classes online without having to worry about these issues. It gives students a chance to learn without worrying about their safety and the safety of others.

Teenagers with disabilities or critical injuries will benefit from online schooling because it gives them a chance to participate in an everyday classroom setting without worrying about commute in between classes and bullying from others. I am so thankful that I am fortunate enough to attend such an inclusive and disability friendly school, however, it is important to recognize that not all schools are like this. Bullying is a major issue within the public school system and many times students with disabilities become easy targets. These students are deserving of the same educational opportunities as everybody else and online classes offer that platform. Adding on, online classes revoke the need for commute between classes. There are times in which students in wheelchairs have trouble getting to class due to the overcrowded hallways and bustling of students. Schools with two to more stories also pose a problem of commute if the elevator breaks. These cases are solved with online schooling because students will no longer have to face these issues. Online classes will benefit teenagers with disabilities because they alleviate the potential threat of bullying and the need for commute between classes.

Online schooling is a powerful and new technological advance that needs to be addressed. It will aid students with transportation needs, revoke unsafe feelings and aid students with disabilities. Others may argue that although being able to attend online classes provides a platform that solves transportation needs, it poses the threat of students falling behind due to lack of a physical teacher. Although this is a reasonable concern, there is no need to worry. Students will be able to work with teachers online and there will still be teacher guidance within these classes. Online classes still have a grade book and many times, these classes offer live calls/chats with the teachers. Students will be able to work on their own time and still maintain grades. Online schooling is a benefit to students everywhere. It grants students unimaginable opportunities because it helps those with tranportation needs, aids with providing a feeling of safety and improves conditions for students with disabilities. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
5F1ED0796466,"In an ever-transforming capitalist society, we still find ourselves longing to achieve the ""American Dream"", a dated concept that we are all competing amongst ourselves towards the desired outcome of eternal ""happiness"" ""prosperity"". Though these ideas are loosely defined, it is evident that this ideal is still widely present within our society; which explains partially why we strenuously embark on our own educational journeys despite having little interest in the information we are being presented. Some students prefer to make amends in their journey towards their

American Dream, opting for a ""distance education"" which allows students to learn via online instruction or video conferencing.

Although distance learning is sometimes regarded as a preferred alternative for many students who may struggle in a traditional K-12 setting, this form of education is restrictive in the sense that it has the potential to be diminishing towards the necessary social development needed for students to succeed in society.

While receiving an online education may offer a more comfortable environment for many students, even offering a nuanced opportunity towards the development of valuable time management skills, typical in-school education provides critical social benefits that an isolated, online-based school environment would struggle to provide. An example of this can be observed on a daily basis: with the simple accessibility of smart phones, it is now engraved in our culture that using technology to opt out of social situations is acceptable and more commonplace than ever before. This is because our long-term un-moderated exposure to technology and its tendency to distract us from meaningful relationships with the people around us, is used as an excuse to limit our own social development. As a technologically-dependent and ever-evolving 21st century society, it would be unrealistic to propose that we halt the development of new technology as a means to preserve basic human interaction. Because these social habits are nearly irreversible on a global scale, an isolated, 100% digitized school environment would only promote the social debilitation of today's adolescent student body.

An in-school education strives to mimic the workplace environment. An example of this is the push for ""hands-on"" learning in the classroom as a response to criticism about lecture and textbook-style education for a more realistic alternative. Hands-on learning has been notably successful across the K-12 community in ensuring that students are not only consuming the information they are receiving, but also applying them in practical situations. This is especially common in CTE courses, where students have the opportunity to operate machinery and complete manual work to prepare them for the demands of that corresponding career pathway. Online schooling, in contrast to a standard public education, fails to fulfill the psychological and tangible necessity for students to fully engage with their learning. Learning through a screen only addresses the consumption of material, while in-school education promotes the routine of a workplace, where employees are not only technologically skilled, but are required to perform manual work as well.

In-school education is necessary for all students in order to provide an effective education system that encourages the fair success of our future in a competitive capitalist society. On both a societal and individual level, an in-school education would entail lifelong social, personal, and monetary benefits that an online education would simply fail to provide long-term. Furthermore, proper socialization beyond core content is a necessity in education.",6,Distance learning,Independent
AEE03367AC03,"Being able to attend a class from home is a poor idea created by schools for students that cant attend school.

Recently schools have created online classes for students who cant attend or when the school is closed. Although some say that a student being able to attend a class from home can benefit their mental stability or there transit.

Attending a class from home promotes being lazy, allows more distractions and can take the drive out of a student.

Some other reasons would be. Not having to attend classes makes the student lazy. The students no longer have to rush to class, or wake up early. Theyre almost encouraged to become more lenient with the work. Also the classes can be completed at any given time allowing severe procrastination to kick in. Taking these online classes you begin to lose the school social life by not actually attending. A key part of any school is the meeting of friends and peers along the way but staying home all the time, you obtain little to no social in school life. knowing your teachers can bring along relationships that can help you out later in life such as a recommendation for a job. Attending from home offers more distractions. some would argue that school is the more distracting place for a student but at home your own freedom can get the best of you and lead you away from your work without someone pulling you back in.

There is a variety of reason why. Being away can free a students mind even with the stress of school.

Allowing a student to be away from their regular home lifestyle can benefit their mood as well as showing them something new in life to keep there mind creative. staying at home offers little life experiences that any kids deserves to experience. It takes away drive a student need to succeed . They no longer have to make a class a priority since they have all the time to complete it, and they begin to lose interest in trying to make sure they are doing the best they can to succeed. Taking an online class just doesnt involve you and keep you in the loop like a regular class will. It could leave you almost less knowledgeable then actually attending. You only retain the information that the online videos or prompts give you, you dont get to here the extra knowledge you could learn in a more interactive environment.

Attending a class from home can leave you lazy, finding more distractions, and it can take the drive out of you.

although some may disagree and say that online school can benefit ones stress levels and take care of housing and transit they are mistaken. Online school can and will be useful in desperate times, such as when theyre is a epidemic and schools need to close and students need to complete there classes somehow but on a note of simply not being able to attend school it can ruin the school life for someone and remove vital things it takes to be a successful adult.              ",5,Distance learning,Independent
C47F20E50D46,"Home schooling has crossed the mind of every student at least once or twice within the twelve years of mandatory school they have to endure. The opportunity to receive an education from the comfort and familiarity of home. Giving students the opportunity to be able to attend classes from home via online would be beneficial to students with physical and/or mental disabilities and would also decrease the truancy rate.

Having a disability in itself is already a burden for some, whether it be physical or mental. Some disabilities make it hard to do everyday things like: waking up on time, speaking in public spaces, being in big crowds, and even in some cases getting an education. Being able to receive schooling in the comfort of your own home, or anywhere for that matter, would help rid the worry of children not getting the schooling they so rightfully deserve. Additionally, online classes would also lower the amount of bulling certain children receive because of their disability. Some kids are very cruel because of unknown reasons, and people shouldn't have to go through that just because they want to learn.

Another problem online school can help is truancy. Being that the class is online there is no excuse not to be able to do the work. Students don't have to show up to a certain place at a specific time or have to wake up super early, as long as some type of internet connection is available. Even though, there will always be some bad apples in the bunch that choose not to take advantage of being able to essentially 'work from home'; that shouldn't talk away the chance for the people would actually put in the effort to do the work.

In conclusion, students should be able to choose whether they want to go to a public school or participate in home/online school, because with being able to pick everyone has a chance to have something that accommodates to their individual needs. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
4B47096239FB,"Attending school practically takes up our entire day, and our entire lives. By the time we get up, get ready, travel to school, attend class, then come home to do additional homework, or entire day is gone. Additionally, we also spend five of the seven days of the week attending class, and those other two days of the weekend are overwhelmed with more homework. What about those who live far away? If they were at home, they would actually be able to get more work done as their commute time is absent. Where is their time allotted to spend time with family when your whole life is centered around school? Lastly, what about those who have a mental illness, that disables them to attend school for a whole day? Students would benefit to a great extent if they could take classes online, at home, because it would cut out commute time, allowing them to work more, would permit more time to do other activities like spending time with family, and would also benefit those who have chronic mental illnesses as these individuals struggle to spend eight hours a day physically at school.

For those who live a great distance away from a school, online classes would benefit them to a great extent. The commute time takes up hours of there day, especially if they ride the bus. School is only eight hours a day, but including travel time, the act of going to school can take up ten or more hours of an individual's 24 hour time period. This permits them from being able to get all there homework done, and can also make them more tired since they must get up early to travel, and then stay up late since they get home much later. This results in an unfocused student, who hardly pays attention in class and additionally, a student who doesn't get as much work done. With online classes, the travel time is absent. This allows a student to learn and work more. The student would have more time in the day to spend quality time working. This would result in a more focused, determined individual.

When your entire day is centered around school- the traveling, class, and homework- students have little time to participate in activities they enjoy and spend time with family, which is crucial for mental stability. Teachers preach of having good grades, extracurriculars, and family time, but school is eliminating these options for the majority of students. With online courses, students can take their time working on school, but would also have time to spend with family and do extracurriculars. This would result in a balanced lifestyle; a lifestyle that isn't overwhelmed with work. The balanced lifestyle would reflect in the student's learning ability, as they would now be more calm and focused to do their work.

For those who have a disabling mental illness, online classes would benefit them greatly. When a student has depression, anxiety etc., they often find themselves unable to attend school for a full day, or even at all. Likewise, if they are present, they cannot focus and by the end of the school day, they are so mentally and physically exhausted that they cannot get their homework done. Their grades suffer as a result. With distance learning, they can work at their own pace, taking the necessary breaks when needed. The individuals would not be concerned with falling behind, because they would be able to do the work when they were mentally stable. Mental illnesses are just as serious as physical illnesses, and the act of physically going to school can be detrimental to their health, and to their grades. Online schooling would allow them to achieve a stable well-being, and a higher state of learning.

The act of physically going to school does not benefit everyone, therefore, online learning would be a beneficial option. Distance learning would still allow for those to achieve an education, but in a more peaceful environment. It would allow students to spend more time on their work since travel time is cut out, and would also permit those to have a balanced life as they spend time doing extracurriculars, being social, and spending time with family. It would greatly impact those with mental illnesses, as it would allow them to work when they are in a healthy mental state, and allow them to work at anytime. This would result in a higher level of knowledge, a more stable mental health, and better grades. Some may argue that school is necessary for social interactions. This argument can be rebutted, as those who choose online courses would actually have more time to be social. Overall, online courses, would drastically improve people's grades as they would be more focused and have more time. It would also permit them to be social and to have family time, resulting in a more balanced lifestyle that would provide better mental stability. Online courses would greatly impact students in a positive way. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
9145AB74E1DA,"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. Yes their will be some kids that will learn online and there won't be some people do work better with the person right in front of them.",3,Distance learning,Independent
4E68CFD1B4D6,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe this is a good way to go around things for people that are disabled and cant walk or stand easily. Lets say you are disables and its hard for you to walk and your school has stairs but no elevator. Instead of going to school, you can work on your school work at home and not have to worry about having to go up and down the stairs, or bumping into people while you go by.

Being able to work on school while at home means you can have experience for when you have a job that you can work remotely for. For example lets say you want to become a proposal manager and you are sick and cant go to work, You will have some experience with working from home and not getting distracted while working because you did it with school work. You will have the proper ability to be able to work and not have to worry if you are going to turn it in on time.

Another example i'm going to explain is that you dont have to worry about not having enough time in class to work on a project or paper. When you are at home, you have a lot more time to work on one thing at a time and not have a time limit. So if you are scared that you will not have enough time to turn in the project while you are at school, if your doing the online course you can work on it for a bit, switch over to another class if you need a break, then work on it more. You are not able to do that if you are at school its one subject at a time.

One downside to working at home is that you dont get to see your friends as often or make new ones. Because if your at home and not at a public or private school you wont see new people as often as if you where going working at home. Making it difficult to make or see friends.

In conclusion if I had the option to work at home I would like to do it.

1C32F25C46EE,"I will say that i desagree with the idea of having distance learning for our's studente to take classes from their home i suggest have doing it the same way as always and have that as a better option.

first reason why: because a lot's of teacher keep their work and keep doing it as they use to and that can that many teacher don have to lose their case there might a lot of them that prefer having a classroom full of student or some others just prefer that way is easier or they like to comunicate with the student and that is something that some times can benefit the student.

second reason student can learn how to be more socialise with others students and that can make them have better comunication with other people for example it would be a lot easier to get job by them self cause that make them feel sure about them self and that make the student better on almost all their classes.

Third reason is that shools can steel be use normaly as long everything is ok with them an the steel can have a porpuse for many reson for students. but some people said that having the student take those from home by way of online or video conferencing might let some student have a more flexeble schedule because at the fact they in their home but i said this might corrupt the student learnig there might tha have acces to wifi or dont transport you know having to go to a library so that's why apik this position about having to take classes online.",3,Distance learning,Independent
93B23DB0F67B,"Students taking classes from home is a advantage and disadvantage. Because most of the students don't pass the online class, its hard for students to understand, what the teacher is talking about when talking through a video call. But most of the parents cant afford to send their kids to school, so the kids gotta learn from home. Goin to school learn is the best way, so the teacher can explain them. The advantage is teachers stay after school for extra help for students. Most teachers come home, and teaches student. The parents can watch what their child is learning. So my paragragh is about disadvantage and advantage.

The students stay home and learn from their parents. If you live in a village in parts of Asia they have small school for students, they are free but their education isn't good. Parents don't have enough money to send their kids to school with good education. The small schools that are free doesn't offer that much education. Students just stay home and let parents teaches watever or how much they know. The schools that are free, the environment isnt good, the teachers arent that much educated.

The advantage is most of the teachers come home, and teaches students for free. Because they understand their parents cant afford. If students go to school and if they need extra help, teachers can stay after school. There are public schools in USA that offer free education. The students can learn a lot from school more than learning at home. In most part of the countries some good schools take a test what students know, if they pass the Government pays the expensive for the students. It is a very big advantage.

So taking classes online or going to school are both good. Beacuse education is very important, going to school is best way to get education. Because what the school teaches nobody can't. ",2,Distance learning,Independent
9FB9825462EE,"The subject of Schooling is a long, complicated and variable. From the debate on public versus private, homework, and the classes themselves, it is a truly mamothian subject. But amoung all of these differnt ideas, the subject of Long Distance Schooling (I.E Students learning from home via some sort of internet enabled device) is so often overlookd.

And i do belive that to be a true shame, for Long Distance Schooling (Hentsforth to be referred to as LDS) is a brilliant tool that should be used everywere! lets show its perks by means of an example. You live near a large metropolitan area, not unlike Generic_City or Generic_City. your daily commute to school can take you as long as 2 hours each way! this means you have to wake up early to get to school, and will have to stay up later to get all your work done. it could quite easily cause you to fall behind in sleep and school. But, through th magic of LDS, you now have 4 extra hours of your day you can work with.

this could be used in a variety of different ways. You could se it for extra sleep, which would probably allow you to perform better in class. or you could spend that extra time you now have pursing post High School opportunitys, such as collge, trade school, or a job. Alredy from time saved, your qaulity of life has been ffr and away bettered by a switch to LDS.

""but hold on"" some of you may be thinking, ""what if i dont live in a city or far away from my school?"". Than your simply not thinking about some of the more commonly applicable elements of such a system. for instance, how often has a student gotten sick and then proceeded to fall behind on classwok? Im sure the qauntity is staggering, but no longer! A student, even if they are sickly and bed ridden, can still participate in classroom activitys by observing and following along with the rest of his or her class.

And even throughing both of this vary well postulated examples to the metephorical wind, you can still find many reasons as to why such a system is benfical. Maybe a student is shy and would perfer a more, disconected aproach?

Perhaps a child cannot attend class due to a long family vacation? One thousand examples could be found in an instant as to why such a system is more than worth the investment by our school systems.

I do hope you find my argument to be valid and well written, as it is my intention to help students the world over by giving them all the tools they need for success.

If the students has that kind of benefit they cant growth higher, and they can have good result. some school makeb online learning ans they have video conferencing because some students have job they can't came to school full time of school and they make that benefit to all students be able to attend classes in home .

931D5E447FA7,"It's good idea to receive distance learning? Well some school offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home. This learning way could have many benefit for student that need distance learning. Also distance learning help student get involved in school, because occasionally the school is giving chance and the opportunity to student to learning. By that way there is not excuse to not learnig or not go to school, you can get your diploma ease.

Distance learning give the option for estudent to get their credit to graduate, particularly for student that are in high grade but they don't have enough credit to graduate. In this case the school give them the option to take distance learning. This is a great opportunity for student that need graduate soon. One example of this is Woodbridge senior high school. Woodbridge senior high school is giving the opportunity to student who need graduate this year, but they don't have enough credit to graduate. Then student are taking distance learnig. Some people must be asking theirself how this is possible, well there are two main way; online or video conferencing. By the way online and video conferencing the student must be have internet access at home. Maybe this can affect the student that dosen't have internet access at home, for those case the school have another options for them.

This two main way are support it by the school, then student dosen't need to pay any charge for their learning. Distance learning can help student finantially because they are taking classes at their, house that means they don't need to go out and spend their money in food or trasnportation.

In conclution distance learning is a very good idea to help student get their credit to graduate as soon is possible and it have many benefit: Finantially, learning, and facility. This way estudent can get their learning and all that they need to get their diploma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",3,Distance learning,Independent
36246752B6F8,"Home school is starting to become more popular thanks to computers. Now with online classes students can take online school instead of coming to a school classroom. But is it the best choice for students be allowed to take school online. Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home because they can pick their own time when they start, have more choices of classes and can still learn during crises.

Picking what time to start school would be a benefit of why students should be able to attend classes from home. For some students it could be hard to wake up at six in the morning to go to school because, of that some teen fail classes. It could be because, they were working all night to help their family with their money problem. With online school student could now start school at ten in morning and have a job later in the day so that they still get job exertions and help their family. It will also get rid of the problem of not being able to go to the bathroom and being hungry during class. Now they could just get go get a snack or use the bathroom. Some may agree, that Student will juts waste their time doing something else. However, with online school parent would be able to check when their kid log in in and for long and also what they have done.

Having more classes to choose form would benefit students taking classes form home. Student would able to pick form more classes online then in school. For example, a kid want to learn about how to build a car or robot., now they can pick more classes based on what they what to do later in life. Schools can not have every avablie classes because of space, but with online now they could take classes that would help them in the future. Also, most adults do not thing that things they learned school were helpful like for example why do we need to learn about pie in math. It would better if there was more classes to choose form help them out in college. Some may agree, that student would take all the easiest class to finish online fast. However, some student may need to take easier classes. One reason could be that they have a learning disable so it is harder for them to learn. also could that they want to not go to college or just want to go to trade school ,so do not need all the harder classes.

Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home because they can still learn during crises.

With the Coronavirus out there right now school are scambing to find away or student to still learn while not spreading the virus. The humans who where already learn for home do not have to worry about nothing and it is also harder for them to get the virus. With diseases and viruses school are one of the fastest ways to spread them. will it take is one kid to have the disease to it around spread the whole school and then everyone gets it. With online school it would be harder for kids to get the disease. Some may agree, that there other ways to spread disease too. However, there are other ways to spread them, but schools are the biggest way. With schools gone it would take way longer for disease like the Coranavirus to spread around the world.

With being able to pick our own time when they start, have more choices of classes and can still learn during crises are reason why Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home. If we do not act now another virus could pop up and stop student form learning. Also with a limited of choices of classes more and more people will just think school is useless. This is why we should just move on to home school.                                    ",4,Distance learning,Independent
2089EF1099EB,"I think that the schools have good idea for the students for them is better because study more in at home, and also is interesting that each student have time for study in home the reasons is because this can to be benefit for the student. I think for some student is more easy take the class for online, but also if the schools have the opportunity about how the student can study in their home. Also because some student don't like coming in schools and for they is easy study in home, maybe they have more time for make homework, and for me is very important because the student is learning more. But there are many student that need study more in the school or home because the study for them is most important in the life . The student need more study , they have more time, and also is important for the future.

When the students have more time for study is more easy for they each day .

for example I'm study in my home I take one class for online and this is more easy study in my home because I have my time,but always and focus in the class is important that the student take class in our home for the future this we help enough for to be good student.

The first reason is about how the student need more study.

The student can study in home because the school have many benefit for them. However we need study more in home or school. the reason is because when study more the homework or test is more easy for us for this is important study, and never we can study for the others if not for our self many time some student they don't want study for they self, but in the life only there one thing is study hard we can stop. and many times be a student is not easy is very hard, this dependent from us which is the most important in the life study or make another think. because always the passion for study is have more time for our study now need more study the others student need study more because this is the more important and is more easy when we have more benefits for take the some class in home because nothing is difficult in the life study in home or school is the same thing, for example some teacher need that the student learn more because some student can not study in the school not pay attention and while we have a benefit for take some class in home we need to be able and responsible.

The second reason is about they have more time.

when the some student study in home have more time because they take time for make another thing, some time when we study in home we find a place alone for study with more concentration, also because the school we need have student with more good ideas y for this reason the student need take the attend classes in home because the school offer one option for each student. and the student need take more time for the study because is interesting take class in our home,many times the student have more time for another thing that for study, for example I'm student, but some times I think that the study is hard but the thing is that the study is the most important and is more better when we have a benefit from the schools, for this we need take more time for study in home is not hard take some classes in home because also we need to be a good person in the future. Today I need to say something I take one class in my home I have my time for make the another homework or something because don't matter how many classes we take in our home, and also we need to know the reason because we need take classes in home this is one opportunity more that when have like student, some student take more time and study because is the most important take more time is our study we need to study more we need to have more time for the good things for our self.

Is important for the future when we studying our home or school is more easy each day. The third reason is about is important in the future.

When we the students we have more benefit in the school is very interesting because this help our self because the school have the opportunity, how the students need have a good future and for this reason the schools offer how help each student. I think that is very interesting for the students because this is for that we have a good future in the life is important when we find a reason for our future but we can be good students when we study more, also because the schools need more students with interest in the school for make a good future because the school is the most important for each student and many time only some students have the opportunity of take the class in home, and this is important in the future when the student work hard each day for a better future,and also never wait that the others study for us because we are student is the most important is give every our effort. I think that this is important endeavor each day for our future better because not there anymore better in the life that the study, also having a good benefit from the school.

Inconclusion when the students have more time is more easy for they each day, and also they have time and their home, this is important for the future. However we need to study more in home or school, because this is important for us and many time we think that study in our home is hard but is interesting study more not only in the schools the student need take more time for study in home because is more easy when the school give one option for this reason the students need study more because is the best always when we are students good,and many time the students lose the opportunity that the school offer. Also we need more time for study because many times we have time for an others thing,but not for study,when the schools give the opportunity for be a good students in the life. And the most important is when the effort from today is the most important for the future because in the life only exist one opportunity,and for this reason we need to study more don't matter if is difficult because our future always is the most important.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent
B7A0347C68C3,"I know taking online or watching video conferencing class can be relaxing sometime, and sometimes student even pray for school to be close. but that does not mean student should take online classes or watch video conferencing , It not a good idea for student to be take online classes and I am not in favor of the idea for student to take online or watch video conferencing because they can find the online teaching to be boring and it will be very hard for student to understand the teaching of the video.

Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing.

firstly why I don't agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they can't focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student don't gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching.

secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing can't be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. like if the video is playing but the student don't understand the teaching of the video he or she can't get the chance to ask question about what they don't understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she don't understand they can ask question about the topic. other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they can't get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching.

I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they can't focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video.

for this way I find it very difficult for student to gained any learning from taking the online or the video conferencing class.       ",4,Distance learning,Independent
16D2B327B978,"Students may view school as an obligation, wishing that they could just stay home all day and relax. At first, the introduction of allowing students to learn through a computer screen in the comfort of their own home may seem like an excellent idea, however, after a while students may begin to feel lonely and as if they are not benefiting much from it. I think that students would not benefit from an at home learning system due to the fact that a face to face learning experience is much more efficient than one behind a screen.

There are lots of students that are home schooled, which does not allow them to have a real school like experience. For most of society, having the school experience taught them things, such as work ethic, time management, how to deal with people, and much more. If a student does online schooling through video calls and conferences, they are just like home schooled students, meaning they will not receive the benefit of having a school experience. For some, the school experience may not have been as pleasing as it was for others, but everyone has gone to a physical school got to make mistakes, learn from them, and apply it to their life later on. If a student goes to school through an online program, they will have not gotten to learn from the experience of being in a physical school, which could cause them incredible difficulties later on, such as the social aspect of life.

A big part of society is social interaction. It has been proved that humans need social interaction to live happily, and if they don't get that, it can have some very bad consequences. For some criminals, the government will put them into isolation as a form of punishment, meaning no interaction with other humans for a period of time. This is a form of punishment due to the fact that humans need the social aspect of life in order to mentally survive. Even though classes through video calls and conferences is nowhere near as bad as isolation is, they may not have many friends outside of their school unless it is because of a sports team or a community project they are involved in. Students who participate in public school are constantly interacting with their peers and teachers, asking questions, talking to friends in the hallways, and so much more. It is through school that so many students have formed close and solid friend groups, who go and hangout on a Friday or Saturday night. Those who do school online find it much harder to make close friends, and this is due to the fact that they are not around their peers all the time, which makes them have to put in a lot more work to find friends to hangout with. Those who are able to form close social bonds with people through school is a reason why students benefit much more by physically going to school rather than an online video call or conference.

Another reason as to why physically attending school is significantly more beneficial than doing classes online is because of the interactive and hands on experience students receive. In classrooms, students get the chance to learn through interaction by participating in labs, presentations, class discussions, and many other interactive experiences. Students can use presentations and class discussions to bounce ideas off of each other, and if a student has a question after a lesson, they do not have to email or call the teacher back, they can simply go up and ask to get the information they need right away. There are lots of students who state that they learn better through visuals and hands on experiences. Those who take classes at home do not have the opportunity to have a real hands on learning experience, which for some could alter how much material their brain actually grasps on to. Students would not be able to physically pick apart the subject they are learning, especially in science areas, which could lead them to not obtain as much information as they could have with an interactive experience.

Having a physical in class learning experience is much more beneficial than one over the internet due to the school experience students receive, the social interaction, and the hands on learning they get to experience. However, even though there is much evidence to backup why going to a classroom to learn is better, it can be stated that learning online through video calls is the way to go. If students have anxiety or are constantly stressed out, learning online may be a much more relaxing way to gain material. Since there is so much more reasoning as to why a physical learning system is so much better than an online one, all evidence gathered to support this overpowers any evidence to support doing classes online. Because of the evidence and reasoning presented, having a physical learning experience is incredibly more beneficial having a learning system online. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
E2630767E36B,"If we have access to the greatest technological innovations of human history, shouldn't we be using them to allow students to choose the way they want to learn? Schools have started to incorporate modern technology into the classroom, where schools are surrounded with screens instead of chalkboards and laptops instead of binders. Thus, as technology becomes easier to integrate with learning, many schools have started to give the option of learning through online software rather than sitting in a classroom. I believe that students would be able to benefit from learning through online or video conferencing, because they would be able to learn in a method that is more convenient, less stressful for students with social issues, and more helpful through the use of learning with online media.

Rather than having to sit in a classroom, online learning would allow students to learn in a way that makes them feel the most comfortable, increasing the convenience and ease of learning. The goal of school is to empower students to learn and gain knowledge that will ultimately help them later in life. Therefore, schools should assess what methods allow students to gain the most amount of knowledge in a given amount of time, thus increasing the efficiency of learning. Schools have tried various methods of increasing efficiency, such as making high school start at a later time or making the cafeteria food more healthy. However, these past changes fail in that they do not tailor the school experience based on one's need. Furthermore, if a student learns best at night time, they do not have the option to take their high school schedule at night. Or, if a student learns best on a couch instead a desk, they have to settle with sitting in a desk for most of their day. These examples show that the best way of increase learning efficiency is by giving choice to the students, and online learning gives much more choice compared to traditional school. Students are not tied to sitting in a classroom or learning at specific points in a day, allowing them to choose the way they learn the best. Thus, convenience and choice from distance learning allow students to gain more knowledge and be more successful later in their jobs. Some may argue that the convenience would lead to a lack of physical interactions at a school, isolating students from developing relationships with their peers. However, since distance learning gives students more choice, they can choose how and when they interact with their peers, allowing social relationships to be built on their own time rather than during school time.

Online learning would decrease stress for students who have social issues attending school. For example, some students with mental disabilities have issues being surrounded with hundreds of other students at school. Luckily, online learning can allow these students to receive their education without having to be around others, which makes learning a much easier process. In addition, I have noticed how social media has made many students develop anxiety over social interactions at schools. However, online learning can allow these students to be less focused on social dilemmas at the hallway and more focused on their studying during school time. Therefore, distance learning can be useful to combat the social problems that distract many students from learning at school.

Finally, online learning can make the learning process more engaging and useful to students through the use of online software. For example, I have taken a course online through a program called Virtual Loudoun, and I noticed how the curriculum involved the use of online slide show presentations, videos, and diagrams. This made my learning process much easier, since the various methods of learning kept me more and engaged and interested to learn. Although some classrooms have implemented presentations and videos, most still largely revolve around teachers lecturing to the class, which does not engage students nearly as well as other online methods. Some may argue that online learning does not allow for students to get specialized or individual help if they have issues. However, online learning still retains all of the traditional benefits that come from learning in a classroom. For example, if a students needs specialized assistance, they can easily setup a video conference to talk individually with their teacher. Also, online software can allow students to take quizzes, tests, and assignments at certain deadlines, and teachers can easily grade their work and upload their results to a grade book. Therefore, online learning has all the advantages of normal classroom learning, on top of increased engagement through the use of different learning methods.

Overall, distance learning with the use of technology is the future of learning as it allows students to choose where and when they learn, have less anxiety for those with social issues, receive a better education through the use of online media. All of these example will allow empower students to be more successful once they eventually enter the workforce. Traditional classrooms have been around for hundreds of years, and it's time that society evolves and transforms the way that students learn by using technological innovations.",6,Distance learning,Independent
AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent
153972503B34,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

In a way that's a great idea not only for students that have anxiety but for students that also have an hard time being in a loud class setting, Every student learns different. For example, take an student that lacks attendance in school or a certain class they'd love to have classes that they can take at home, Relying off what I previously stated earlier in my response every student learns differently and maybe at home could be a rejoice for some students,But it also has its pros and cons what are some pros you might ask? the pros are you can do how much work you want in an untimely manner, you don't have to get up earlier in the morning to get dressed you can stay in your bed clothes, also everything you do is in your secure location.

For example, first off no loud students, annoying teachers, and etc. Now for the cons. homeschooling doesn't give the child an actual high school experience in a way they don't have access to an teacher at that second or whenever they're stuck on an problem. As for myself, I take online classes right now at home and school and feel like its way better because the work gets done quicker and the house is quiet enough for me to work and learn, I also love listening to music while i work so in a way thats better than an teacher telling you that you can't do this is or that because you're at home.

I also know that many home school or online classes let you take your class when ever you want so that's an plus also you don't have to get up from your nice cozy warm bed in the morning, it's almost kinda like i'm torn in between because I like going to school also and seeing the different people that I go to school with instead of being at home in front of an laptop or computer screen everyday I have classes. It gets repetitive and you start to miss being around people regular school gives you the opportunity to meet new people join an club that you might have interests in also many sports teams that online schooling just doesn't have.

You know what I think should happen? i feel like they should make it so they have this class or location that's away from the rest of the school and the students that would love to do online schooling or classes could go there and still get the high school experience but without all the extra things they have to go through. although both have their separate own pros and cons the best option for me and i'm sure a lot of students would feel this way too is the online schooling yeah I feel like everyone should get their high school experience but not everyone has the mindset to come to school everyday.

For instance, imagine an scenario where an kid just lost an family member or has a very bad accident and getting up and going to school isn't the first thing on their list I feel like that's where they would implement an online schooling for that particular child because it happens a lot in the U.S. where children are falling behind and instead of putting them in online classes or so the school decides to fail them and put them in the same class that following fall or next school year not knowing what may or may not have happen to that particular child everyone's story is different and everyone comes from a different background and set of parents.

For my final reasoning why online schooling is an better option is because what if we have snow days or commonly in the US are school shootings first and for most, Snow days are common in Virginia and we have to make up those days we miss with online schooling we wouldn't have to do that we could all be on our online schooling taking the class for the day(s) we missed due to that snow day , Second off, School shootings have been a lot recently and with online courses and/or classes it cuts back on that dramatically, Finally let's talk about other things that could change/happen as a result of switching from regular schooling to online it cuts back on fights at school dramatically also it reduces bullying and other things and dropouts, But I know you're asking yourself but what if the student does't have access to such thing like an laptop or computer the school should issue out laptop and other things to the kids that need them. So in other words, online schooling would be the best option not only for myself, but for a lot of others as well who have an hard time with certain things not every students work ethic is the same some are slow others are fast some catch on quick others don't it just depends on who you are or how your work ethic describes you. Homeschooling also does not have an high dropout rate it has an 87% chance of graduation with homeschooling it's the better option. staying home, eating when ever you want, doing your work when ever u want, listening to music when ever you want. and so forth not to mention there is no time limit to homeschooling and also no stopping mark so u can go how far you would like. Yes 1000x times yes students would benefit more from homeschooling and/or online courses.                                                                                    ",3,Distance learning,Independent
BA881F8A8909,"Many students choose to participate in traditional and online schooling.

Online schooling can include video conferencing with teacher or enrollment in a class taken on the computer.

Giving students the ability to take classes from home is a widely debated topic.

Although some believe that students should only have the option of traditional schooling because they are less likely to learn social skills at home, students should be given the opportunity to participate in online schooling because it allows them to work at their own pace, lower their stress levels, and take multiple classes at once.

To begin with, students will be able to work at their own pace.

When taking a test in a traditional classroom, some students finish in ten minutes and others take the entire class.

Either way, students should not feel the need to slow down or speed up in order to finish in a certain time.

Forcing kids to work at the pace of their peers will produce lower test scores.

With the option of online school, students are able to finish assignments at their own time.

As a result, assignments will be given more attention by students and will overall turn out better than they would have in the classroom.

Students are capable of producing better work, if they are able to work at their own pace.

In addition, stress levels in students will significantly decrease.

Stress and anxiety among students is extremely high.

Many kids have test anxiety and are not able to perform well in testing environments.

Testing anxiety can be caused by numerous factors but one factor that stands out the most is feeling comfortable in an environment.

If the student does not feel comfortable in their classroom while taking a test, they will not produce a good grade.

If the student is placed in a well suited environment, like their home, they are guaranteed to receive a better grade than if they were placed in a classroom.

Secondly, if students are able take their time and not rush through school work, stress levels will reduce and the amount of passing students will increase.

Students often feel rushed to finish in a short amount of time in order to please their teachers.

Although many teachers preach to their students to take their time, teachers unknowingly put a time restriction on student.

Online courses allow kids to start and finish assignment when they feel comfortable doing so.

Online classes lowers the chance of stress among students by eliminating classroom anxiety.

Furthermore, the ability to take extra classes is given to students.

In order to graduate at many public and private schools, students must meet graduation requirements.

There are multiple classes a student must take to graduate that are electives.

These classes take up space in kid's schedules restricting the amount of core classes a student can take.

If schools allow these kids to take these classes in their free time, students will be able to complete these courses and move onto classes they will use in the future.

For example, all school require students to partake in a health class throughout their high school careers.

If students are capable of taking this class in the summer rather than in the school year, a new gap in their schedule opens for another class.

Also, online schools prevent advance students from burning out.

Many children who were placed in advanced learning at a young age experience a burn out.

This occurs when the student does not have to work as hard in their education as others.

This produces a poor work ethic, which is essential in the real world.

By allowing these students to take an extra course online, they will be challenged forcing them to improve their work ethic and time management.

Online school gives students a chance to get ahead in their education

In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to participate in online school because they will have the ability to work at a their own speed, reduce their stress levels, and participate in more classes.

If students are unable to take online courses, they are more likely to get off track in their learning.

By giving students this education outlet, students will be more likely to graduate and be ready to dive into their adult lives.",5,Distance learning,Independent
11F106935EDA,"Some schools that have an option for student to have attendance classes from home. Do you think that students should attend classes from school. Some people believe students should attend class from home while other people believe students would not have benefit from being able to attend classes from home. To attend classes form home, students would not benefit or help about their learning because school can improve teamwork skill, can make friends, and can ask the teacher.

Firstly, students can improve their teamwork skill to work as a group with other student. School have group work or the project that students can join together and work as a work. To illustrated, when the teacher give work to students that is a group work, and students should have a partner to work together, students have to talk to each other to plan what they need to do and help other understand what to do. Students can learn how to work with other person. The teachers must have group works for their students. Student should have teamwork skill because it will help them in the future when they have jobs to work will other person. Thus, for improve teamwork skill of students, they should attend classes in school that they can work as a group.

Secondly, Students can make friends in school. Students can relax and enjoy to attend classes when they with their friends. For example, after students finished their group work, they also have a good relationship with their partner. When students have friends, their can teach each other to understand to the classes and help to do their homework or class work. Students can make a lot of friends and help each other to pass the classes that maybe hard or easy for them. Therefore, to make friends is not hard to do when students are in school and school have many classes for help students to learn.

However, not everyone agree with this statement that some people believe students would benefit from being ale to attend classes from home because students can work and learn with their own way, have classes that they very want to learn, and help them to work in the computer. Nevertheless, look overs as an important point that student can ask questions to the teachers when they are not understand. When their friends can not help and do not know what to do students can ask the teacher for help. For example, When students do not understand in the class, and they can ask the teacher to explain or speak slowly for them to have more understand. The teachers also have to help their students to pass the classes, so teachers ready for students to ask them any questions. At home, students can not ask to the teachers if they are offline or no internet, and then they will ask their parents, but not all questions parents can answer. Therefore, the teachers can help students if they need help every times when they are at school and attend classes.

In conclusion, students should have attendance classes in school. Students can have to improve to their teamwork skill to work with their friends or other person in the future. Student can make a lot of friends, enjoy to the classes together and help each other work. Student can ask teachers whatever they want to know about the class, and teachers always help and answer the question that students asked. All of this are in school. Student will also get more experience from work as groups, friends, and ask the teachers. School can help student to attend classes because in school already have tools for student to learn.",5,Distance learning,Independent
D337DC4042D2,"Some schools offer distance learning for students. This learning from a distance caters to a new generation of students whilst also allowing more flexibility for the student. Although the schools may have reasoning specific to them, students also have much to gain from this opportunity. If the opportunity is taken and used correctly, a more secure environment will be available, online tutoring will be available, and a much wider range of schools will be available. These reasons outline the benefit that students receive from distance learning.

Firstly, a secure environment will be readily available for the student enrolled in distance learning. If learning can take place in one's own home certain advantages are guaranteed. These advantages include, familiarity with the environment, and quiet during the time of study. Familiarity with the environment allows the student to direct as much focus as possible to the subject that is being taught. Whilst at home the student is knowledgeable of their surroundings which leaves one less thing to be learned. If this were not the case and the student was in a regular school setting then there would be a multitude of distractions such as the classroom. The classroom is constantly vulnerable to disarray, because of the number of students using it throughout the day. If an online video conference is used then these distractions will not be seen by students. Other students will also not be seen which will drastically decrease the number of distraction sourcing from the behavior of others. Additionally, sound may prove to be an issue in the classroom for the same reason of having many more people in the room during learning. During a video call, students will be isolated from other sounds. Often conferences of this nature require push-to-talk, a feature limiting microphone activity to a button press. This will cut down on distractions because, if a student were to push this button and purposefully cause distractions it would be easily taken care of. The combination of the previous example, and the inherent control over sound in one's own home limits sound and assures quiet other than the teacher.

This distractionless environment will allow the student the utmost ability to focus on learning.

Secondly, if receiving lessons online, a student may be able to receive more additional help. This help can come in multiple ways, stemming from the teacher, or found online. Whilst a student takes classes through online means of education then they will also receive easier access to tutoring. The aforementioned lack of distractions allows class to flow much more easily, sometimes resulting in less time spent lecturing to a group. This group could also include infinitely more students giving the professor much more free time. After class has been completed for a day, a student can contact the professor for a one-on-one tutoring session in which direct instruction can be given, dramatically increasing the students personal understanding of the topic. Obviously online instruction also has the benefit of the internet. This inherent advantage can be used to look up additional examples if needed, along with easily connecting with peers that share the same misunderstandings with you. This allows for study groups to form more frequently, and successfully. A combination of these tactics can prove to be vastly more efficient and helpful than if learning in person, as a professor may not have the time, other students may have time constraints that do not allow for group study or tutoring in any other way, and the vast internet allows many examples and sources to be viewed at a moments notice.

Finally, schools will be much more accessible for students. This advantage stems from the wider range of schools available, less costly supplies, and much more flexible schedule. The internet is a world wide connection, this connection will also apply to students looking to learn through these means. For example, a student can live in Virginia, and easily take classes at MiT which is located across multiple state lines. This can be applied to any higher education in the world, and even lower education such as high school, if a student becomes severely injured. If taking classes from home, food and living expenses will be vastly cheaper. One will still have to pay tuition, but basic living expenses could be mitigated through splitting cost with others, and the possibility of living with one's parents for a while longer. This online connection also offers more flexibility as you wont have to plan most things, and leave, for example, thirty minutes before you are due in class, only to arrive late. Online can fix this because of the inherent convenience of a faster log in and show up time, five minutes instead of thirty.

Although these advantages are given to the student who chooses to take the opportunity of distance learning, there are some aspects that will, admittedly, be lacking. For example, face-to-face interaction will be unavailable, and social interactions with other students will be vastly more difficult to establish as a student may have to travel longer distances if desired. Many people believe that these two aspects are crucial to one's education. These interactions are part of curing social awkwardness and may be included as part of the learning process. Although, online students may receive more social interaction through chat rooms.

In conclusion, distance learning provides many advantages to students that traditional teaching does not. These advantages include secure environments, more available aid, and accessibility. The combination of these advantages can lead to improved grades and better experiences for the student. Even though the student may lack in person interaction, this can be supplemented by the sheer amount of interaction available online. Distance learning allows man advantages and should be offered for all students around the globe.",6,Distance learning,Independent
9DB1AA4819AD,"Many schools around the world offer long distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools will offer this if school has been temporarily shut down or if the student wishes to take a course the school does not offer. While a few number of people believe online school is unhealthy and wrong for students, in reality, online school provides many benefits and programs not offered by regular school. Online school has changed education for the better and made learning more accessible to people across the world.

In case of emergencies, schools have been known to close school and have the students learn online and do their work at home. If any diseases are running rampant or the school has a internal issue, schools tend to rely on new technology that will allow teachers to teach their students while they are in the safety of their home. Recently, the corona virus has been a problematic issue in my school area. The schools have closed one day off school to teach the teachers that if an emergency arrives and the students are not able to go to school, they will be able to teach from long distances and classes can resume as normal. Instead of a natural disaster or disease closing down school and stopping schools from functioning, educating students would continue without fear. The new age of technology not only increases the amount of information, but makes it more accessible.

Online school students also take online classes to get credits for classes their local schools do not provide. Current public schools do not offer every single class to satisfy every single student. A way of students going around that issue is online school. Online school provides almost every single course a student would want to take, from culinary classes to advanced mathematics. For example, my friend Generic_Name, a member of my school's Cyber Security Club, had just passed Cyber Security Fundamentals and was looking to move on to the next unit. However, my school did not offer Cyber Security 1, so Generic_Name talked to his councilor and was able to take the class at home using an online course and receive credits on his diploma. Online school provides more information, classes, and options to students who seek a broader education.

Critics argue that online school takes away from the personal experience of school and offers a way for kids to not go to school. While online school does take away party from the personal experience you would get at a public school, online school makes up for that with video conferencing and direct communication with the teacher and other students. Critics say online school kids use online school as a way to get out of going to real school. That statement is false, most students that take the online courses do this so they can work at their own pace and learn things not offered by his or her public school. Online school widens the range for students to learn and provides an alternative method to taking classes and learning in general. Students learn at different paces and online school gives students the power to work at their own pace without fear of falling behind in a class.

Over the past five years, online school has had a huge impact on learning and accessibility of information. It has become detrimental to a great number of students and a beneficial resource to schools across the world. It helps schools in crisis, provides more curriculum, and lets students work at their own pace. Without this resource our education system would be crippled and our students would suffer. Some may believe online school is anti social and negative for students, it is undeniable that online school provides millions of benefits and programs not offered by regular school. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
A7AB35E04C19,"Being able to have your classes online is very benefical for your present and future. There is an ongoing debate on whether or not distance learning is benefical. Those who disagree state there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it? I believe distance learning is very benefical to more than just the student.

Students will have less to worry about if they can't make it to school everyday. The attendance rates will go up because those who can't make it to school can still attend their classes online, leaving them with less stress. Makeup work for students will also be less of a problem, because they won't miss as much as they would if distance learning wasn't an option. This allows students to keep a stable grade while balancing school and other required responsibilities. More students will be able to stay caught up at school with distance learning offered.

Having distance learning also gives those who feel unconfortable being at school another option. If a student has a social disorder and doesn't strive in school due to their disorder, they now have the option to work where they feel comfortable through distance learning. This may also help improve their mental health by relieving stress. Those students who get bullied and dread coming school can avoid being bullied by having distance learning offered. This may make them more comfortable and help them focus on their school work, causing their grades to go up. Distance learning will be very benefical to those who are uncomfortable and can't do their best at school.

Distance learning could be very benefical and a great option for students. Those who disagree state: there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it? I disagree because it can benefit many diffrent types of students in many ways. This is important because your future is based of the progress you make now.",4,Distance learning,Independent
7B12C9A10547,"Online Schooling

Technology as a whole has developed drastically over the last decade. Technology is such an amazing and useful part of things we do every day. One of the most life changing technological advancements that have been made, is online schooling or at home schooling. There are many positive things about online schooling and how it has helped shape our society today. At home schooling is a great option for many students because they can learn at their own pace, go to schools further away, and be sick less often.

The first reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they could learn at their own pace. Many students struggle with the fast pace school environment. For example, students are required to get to class on time, turn their work in on time, and even write down notes while keeping up with their teachers. On the other hand, some students think that the curriculum is too slow paced. Likewise, some students feel as though they are given too much time for assignments, too much time to get to class, or even too much time to take notes. Overall, students have different rates of learning, and the school curriculum doesn't always take that into consideration. Based on this evidence, it is logical to assume that at home schooling can allow students to learn at their own pace.

The second reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they could be given the chance to go to schools further away. Many students aren't able to go to a preferred school because they are too far away. Giving students an opportunities to take classes at home and online could allow them to enroll in classes at schools that they would rather go to. Also, a student might want to take a specific class that the nearest school might not offer. Furthermore, some students may already know what they want to do for a career and if so, they might need to take a specific class before starting that career. If the school they are attending does not have that class, the student could be held back from their fullest potential. It is obvious that at home schooling could allow students to attend and take classes at schools that are further away.

The final reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they would be sick less often. With less human contact, students wouldn't be sick as often and wouldn't come in contact with as many harmful illnesses. Also, even if the student were to get sick, he or she would still be able to attend school with out infecting their peers or teachers. This would, in return, allow students to continue their education while being sick without the fear of getting anyone else sick. This could also help to stop the spread of harmful diseases like chicken pox, measles, and other easily transmittable illnesses. Naturally, allowing students to take online classes can help them to be sick less often.

Many people say that students who don't have access to internet would be at a disadvantage. However, those students would still be able to attend a regular, tangible school or they could use guide books for each class. Having online classes would just be easier to attend for those who do have internet access at home. Since students would be able to work at their own pace, go to school further away, and be sick less often, at home schooling would be a great option for many students. Our youth would be very well educated if more schools started offering classes at home. Our society and future generations would be better developed as well. So please, speak to your school board members and propose the idea of at home classes at you local schools and make your community a better place. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
C55E751BB583,"Some schools has started offering distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online and or video conference, but some people don't think students will benefit from it while others think this is an incredible opportunity for students. some will argue that students will benefit more from distant learning than being stuck in a classroom because they can move at their own pace and not have to worry about being left behind by their other peers in the classroom. Also, students may need additional help so if they need that extra attention they can get it because it's just the student and the instructor. Next, Distant learning can help students who are behind make up credits they need to graduate and still take the classes they are supposed to be in. Although, Distant learning has its benefits people will argue that students will not benefit from distant learning. students will just take this opportunity for granted and need to be held responsible like everyone else and pass the class in the classroom.

Distant learning can be argued that students will not get the information the same as if they were in the classroom. Because students are not there physically with a teacher they are more likely to cheat then if they were at school taking a test. Then, there is no guarantee that students will open up their laptop or turn in their computer screen everyday. Also,It's more distractions at home than it is at school because students are going to be more worried about whats on Netflix or whats in the refrigerator to eat than paying attention to the instructor on the computer screen. Finally, students wouldn't have the same motivation to get up like they do when coming to school everyday to see their friends, significant others, and their best friends.

I personally think that students will not benefit from distant learning. I say that because it would be more of the class clowns and the students who didn't apply them selves in the program more than the kids who actually needs it. Wouldn't be fair for the students who works hard in the classroom and deals with all the distractions. Lets be realistic if you are not special ed you are more than capable to pass a class in the classroom with the rest of the students if you put your mind to it. I personally feel like schools are giving students too many ways for them to be lazy in the classroom. schools should hold students more accountable for the work they put in their work if the student is not doing the work he should be able to go home and take the class online when they are students giving it all they got in the classroom.

Distant learning has it's pros and cons but I feel like it has more cons than pros. Students are more than capable to do their work in a classroom and doesn't have to do work online in a classroom. What happens when you applying for college or a job and you need a teacher recommendation and your teacher was a robot in a computer reading you instructions how are you going to get a teacher recommendation ?

How about when you don't understand how something is being explained to you on the computer and you have no classmates to explain it to you in a easier way? what are students going to do when times like that happen ?

I'm going to tell you whats going to happen they are going to just give up or quit or they are just going to write down any answer or just answer anything just to get it done and end up failing the assignment, when he or she can't get teacher recommendations for college or a job he is not going to get accepted in the college or not get hired for the job. What i'm trying to say is that going to school might be a little more difficult, might not like going to school, probably would be anywhere else in the word than be at school, being at school gives you more opportunities in life than online school because the kid next to you could be a boss at a million dollar company and could offer you a job just because he went to high school with you.

03B874232827,"Recently long distance learning has been introduced to schools and has helped many students in many ways. Students are now able to learn from home instead of learning at school. Students would benefit form being able to attend classes from home because it would be more convenient, allow more family time, and allow the student to work at their own pace.

First, Students would benefit from learning from home because it would be more convenient. When a student is learning from home they wouldnt have to get dressed so go to school. They could stay comfortable in they're bed and learn. Students wont have to worry about distractions from other students because they would be alone. Another reason learning from home would be more more convenient is students could get more breaks and spend time to themselves.

Next, Learning from home is better than learning in school because you can spend more time with your family. When students learn at school they spend eight hours in school and then come home. Some students parents arent home when they get out of school and the students spend less time with they're parents. When students learn from home they can spend more time with they're parents. Students are more likely to be successful when happy and learning with family helps keep the student happy.

Furthermore, other people may argue that learning at school is better than learning at home because it allows students to be more socially active. But learning at home is better than learning at school because it allows the student to work at their own pace. In school students have timed class periods and they have to do the work in that time limit but at home they can work at their own pace. Working at your own pace can also reduce stress and allow the student to work more efficiently.

Finally, Students would benefit from attending classes at home because it would be more convenient, allow more family time, and allow the student to work at their own pace. This would also help students with learning disabilities. Students with medical conditions or injuries can benefit from this so they wont miss school.",4,Distance learning,Independent
1553852F57B7,"As a student enrolled in public schools I have had various experinces where I felt that I didn't fit in; or felt severe levels of stress and anxiey. I am now a junior in highschool and have now gotten somewhat used to what is required of me in a public school. If the the privilage of taking online classes would have been offered to me I wouldn't have lost my personality and mental health to the society that is seen in public schools. Now, that the oppurtunity of enrolling in classes online and studying from home is an option; people that feel that they wouldn't be able to handle the society in public schools now have another way to look. The concept that students may benefit from taking classes at home is valid because they would be able to achieve more focus and concentration and they would experince less stress and anxiety; thus strengthening their mental health.

Students may benefit from taking classes at home because they could gain more focus and concentration. There are some people who concentrate better when studying alone. These students enrolled in online classes may be more focused because they are in a more comfortable environment, which is their home. They will learn more because they don't have to wake up as early as people that go to public schools. They also wouldn't have to worry much about their apperance such as what they're going to wear, how their hair needs to be styled, how to hide their eyebags, if they need make up on, and what shoes to put on. They could also perform better academically because they have the oppurtunity of starting thier classes later. Having enough hours of sleep benefits students because it allows the brain to function at its full potential. The students could feel more enthusiastic about school because they don't have to listen to a teacher tell them what they can and can't do.

Students will benefit from taking classes from their homes in the form of having better mental health. Every human being at some point during their lifetime experinces the feeling of being nervous, anxious, or stressed. Most students experince this when they have to present themselves or a project infront of a class full of other students. Their anxiety rises especially in these situations because they feel like they're being judged or scrutinized. To add to their stress and anxiety the students have to deal with other students, teachers, and various homework assignments. They could also lose their personalities to the society found in public schools. Students often lose who they truly are when they are under an immense amount of pressure. Which leads to their mental health decreasing drastically.

Some may argue that student may become isolated if they take classes at home. Those that argue that claim may also think that student who take classes at home may lack communication skills, which are essential for the future. Others can also say the some students aren't ready to take on resonsibility that comes with taking classes online.

Overall, enrolling in classes that you are able to take at home can benefit students in the long run because they will feel less pressured. Their mental health would be strong and they would have a strong sense of self. They would also perform better because they would get the necessary amount of hours that a person needs to function properly.",5,Distance learning,Independent
22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes.

First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

I think,student should go to school because I believe that we can do better when we do thing that not just read books or study at home but we should go to school fore getting better.         ",3,Distance learning,Independent
FA5D64EC3C72,"Technology has been a huge component to help stimulate learning in students. With the availability of the Internet and technological devices in most schools today, there is a copious amount of resources students can use to help advance their learning in and out of school. From watching educational videos to doing online interactive activities, technology can be a student's friend to understanding more than what is taught in a classroom setting. There is so much the Internet can provide that we sometimes don't even need to be in a classroom to be able to learn. Distance learning has become so much easier with technology and the resources it has. Therefore, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can stay in touch with online communication, students can have access to many online programs to assist them in their learning, and students can use online resources to do assignments.

There are so many ways to communicate without being face-to-face with someone, so it's very easy to be able to know what is going on in a class solely from being online. In fact, relationships between teachers and students can be fostered well if the student is dedicated to communicating with his or her teacher often. With all the modes of communication made available, a student can contact a teacher via emails, video calls, voice messages, texts, or phone calls. I have taken a couple online classes for my convenience, and being able to communicate with my teacher has always been effective. I always got a timely response from my teachers, and they were able to reach out to me often to see if I had any questions. In my online Spanish class, we had a requirement to have a call with our teacher every week to talk about how we were doing on our assignments, so there was a good connection developed throughout the course. There are even options where you can collaborate online with students on assignments, which contributes to having more of a connection with others. Effective communication online can help students feel closer with others that they can't directly talk to.

With the abundance of programs avalable to students online, there's no doubt that a student can still learn just as much online as in a classroom. To learn the basic concepts, there are interactive programs embedded in a lot of online classes where you watch a video and answer questions to see how much you know about the concept. There are also live video calls to go over the material and talk to each other directly. This can mirror how a classroom environment is. I took an online SAT class where we would have to report to a video call portal at a certain time, and the teacher would make sure that we were able to answer questions as we learned the material. This has been a great way to learn for me, because I can still be just as engaged as I would be in a classroom. The best part of the system was that the teacher could save that lesson as a recording for us to go back and revise information at any time. Like this, there are so many variations of online classrooms where teachers teach as much as they can to students in order for them to be successful. So many students I know love this method of learning because it feels nice to be able to do the same things you could do at school in the convenience of your own house. Online teachers could get students to learn so much, all thanks to technology being able to replicate the feel of being in a classroom.

Any class requires students to be able to apply what they know with assignments and tests. Luckily, students online can do this easily with assignments and assessments embedded into their courses. There are many types of assignments that can be assigned with due dates because of the many things that can be done online. For example, in my history class we got a variety of assignments like writing essays, making a podcast, filling out graphic organizers, making slideshow presentations, and more. There are so many online devices that could be used for these type of assignments such as Microsoft Word, Google Slides, Google Drawings, and voice recorders. These are even used in classrooms everyday to do assignments, so online students get access to the same things that schools use. For test taking, there is often a system that online students have where they don't have access to any other tabs online to avoid cheating, and they get timed to represent how tests in school are often timed as well. Online classes are treated fairly in this sense where students don't get an advantage of being on the Internet to help them on tests, just like how it would be in school. Online students being able to do assignments similar to students in school makes online classes require just as much work and dedication as a normal class has.

To conclude, the advancement of technology has been the underlying reason why online students can get similar opportunities as school students. Distance learning doesn't hinder from the fact that students can make an effort to work with teachers and students, in order build good relationships when it comes to school work. Being online allows for effective learning where students can feel involved in the learning just as a student in school would. Online classes also provide the ability to be able to do a wide variety of assignments and assessments. Many students who don't have the convenience of taking a class at school now have the great opportunity to learn just as well as someone in a classroom would. Education has truly bettered from technology being able to serve so many purposes, and it can reach people of so many different locations who can now use the Internet for their learning everyday.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent
572D5C1F21BC,"The advent of widespread, fast, and reliable internet connectivity has enabled the creation of entirely new industries and collaborative efforts. However, in a world where millions of people earn their living sitting in front of a computer screen at home, it is surprising that the education system has largely failed to follow. Many classes already contain significant online elements which are able to be completed at any computer, yet schools still require students to complete that work on in-school devices. Students would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes online at home due to the improved work schedule, more relaxed learning environment, and potential health benefits.

The most immediate benefits of online classes are related to the improved time schedule that they allow a student. With the current in-school system, students' class times are limited to the those set by the school in an attempt to best serve the huge variety of courses and needs of each student, all using the same bell schedule. Some students are inevitably ill-served by this uniform schedule, such as those that have other commitments late at night which cause them to lose out on sleep due to the early start times of school, or students that simply work better at certain times of the day. Additionally, different courses require different amounts of work, meaning that in the traditional block schedule, students may find themselves simply wasting time after completing their work for the remainder of one block, while they may be scrambling to finish their work by the end of another block. With online classes, students may also find that they can participate in daytime activities which they were previously either unable to attend while in school, or had to reserve for the weekends, having chosen to complete their classwork later in the day.

Another benefit of an online course program is the potential for a more relaxed learning environment. The classroom is not always the ideal place to learn or work, and by removing the need for students to physically enter a school building, they are enabled to choose whichever place works best for them to complete their work, whether that be in the comfort of their home or the solitude of a public library. This can increase productivity by allowing students to move away from distractions and set up their work spaces however they wish. In addition to this, the ability to work anywhere could also help to reduce stress, a major problem for students, especially those at higher levels. This is the result of giving students the freedom to pick who, if anyone, they want to work with, reducing social pressures that many students are negatively affected by, and allowing them to work on a less strict time schedule.

A final major perk of in-home learning is the potential health benefits for students. As they are, schools become breeding grounds for germs, as evidenced by the tremendous number of students who become sick each year during Flu season, or the waves of absences caused by a stomach bug. For many students, and even teachers, these illnesses would be entirely preventable, if they were not required to interact with hundreds of other people in close quarters, as would be the case if distance learning were implemented. This bonus would be especially helpful during outbreaks of rarer, stronger illnesses, such as the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak. Schools are under threat to be shut down during these outbreaks, causing major disruptions to student learning; disruptions that would be almost unnoticeable to students taking online courses.

The internet is a powerful tool, which could easily allow many courses to convert to an online-only experience, eliminating the need for students to physically attend school. Were this to become a reality, the time, mental health, and physiological health benefits would greatly affect students, and enable a myriad of new opportunities.                    ",5,Distance learning,Independent
68685615FE0C,"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.     ",5,Distance learning,Independent
88FCD4D35128,"That some schools offer the option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that this option is a really good idea for the students. This option can benefit many students that cannot attend schools in the regular schedule. Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies.

Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies.

The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom.

One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people.

As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future.

I think that if more schools provide distance learning as option for the student, more people can get involve and be benefit with this program, and get better opportunities on their life. Because now that the school are doing this is not excuses to not finished the school.                      ",4,Distance learning,Independent
E0BBCFF37E53,"As of recently, the discussion as to whether schools should offer distance learning has come to light. Distance learning provides students with access to classes in a home setting. These classes are to be taken virtually with online and video conferencing. Although it is almost certain that this idea was proposed with good intention, the red flags that come with it are far too many to ignore. Students would not benefit from attending class at home because they would not have a concrete form of direct guidance, there wouldn't be a rigid structure of routine in their learning experiences, and students would undergo a significant lack of human interaction in their everyday lives.

Firstly, if distance learning was to take place, students would not have a concrete form of direct guidance to assist them throughout their school curriculum. The main reason that school is made mandatory for all minors, is to ensure that all children receive the proper education that they deserve. Enrollment in a distance learning course would remove the aspect of having a teacher in front of a student. It is important for students to be able to make eye contact with a teacher when learning, as it improves attention span and listening skills. A computed teacher cannot compare to a physical teacher's ability to respond and answer specific questions simultaneously. It is impossible to achieve the same dynamic of instruction and comprehension when learning virtually. When comparing distance learning students and in-school learning students, the in-school students are definitely reaping the most benefits.

Secondly, if students were to attend classes at home, there wouldn't be the same rigid structure in their learning experience. When students go to school they fall into a routine: waking up at the same time, attending classes in the same order, and eating lunch with the same people. Having class at home doesn't consist of any routine or structure because there isn't anything or anyone there to be held accountable by. At school, there is the bell or the possibility of receiving a ""tardy"" in a class that keeps students accountable to sticking to routine. In a home setting, there is nothing that would motivate the student to continue to pursue their education. Furthermore, in cases where distance learning has been tested out before, results show that students tend to fall behind on assignments and assessments. The reasoning for this being that the lack of structure in their everyday learning becomes detrimental to the student's chances of success in the class. Distance learning students would not benefit from attending class from home because the lack of structure and routine in their day is enough damage done.

Lastly, students would undergo a significant decrease in amount of human interaction in their everyday lives. One could argue that human interaction isn't necessary to a student's learning process. They may even bring up homeschooling as a comparison. However, homeschooling is the perfect example of how important being around other people is to one's mental development as a whole. Statistics show that 45% of home-schooled children struggle in social capacities after leaving their childhood home. Putting students in online courses is essentially confirming their fate to social incapability. Knowing how to properly communicate with others is one of the most important lessons taught in schools. Without interaction from their peers, distance learning students will end up conflicted in instances like work scenarios in the very near future. This is a problem that can be avoided with the simple elimination of all suggestions leaning towards virtual learning.

In conclusion, the topic of distance learning is controversial. However, the cons outweigh the pros by a vast magnitude. The decisions that must be made my school officials and superintendents should not be taken lightly, as the future of these students are in their hands. Students would not benefit from attending class at home because they would not have a concrete form of direct guidance, there wouldn't be a rigid structure of routine in their learning experiences, and students would undergo a significant lack of human interaction in their everyday lives.",5,Distance learning,Independent
D9B24103EA38,"A student lounges on his couch, eating cereal while listening to his professor give a lecture. While this scene may evoke a feeling of a relaxed learning environment, many, if not all students would actually find it much harder to experience a good quality education from home. By attending school from home, students would be unfocused and miss out on opportunities that only a physical school can provide. A school provides a specified location completely dedicated to learning. Students from all over get together and interact, learning not only the course material, but life skills in human interaction.

Many homes that house one or more students are normally very busy place. Take an average middle class family, around two parents and three children. At least one parent has work, so they are away for they majority of the day. The other parent must now be the one to shuttle the students to doctors appointments, and cannot leave them home. The parent would have to decide between taking their children to everywhere the parent goes, and distracting the children from education, or leaving them home alone. Either the students would not be able to focus on their work, or the parent would not get anything useful done. Say they had a nanny to watch the children while the parents work. Now the children have to be impossibly restrained to keep themselves from bothering each other. Imagine trying to focus on a physics lecture while trying to stop a young child from coming into your room screaming. Even if the conditions at home are completely perfect, a student needs to somehow remain completely focused. A screen with colors and sounds coming out of it does not hold one responsible as well as an in person teacher. The distractions could range from ""just taking a break"" to ""just getting some fresh air"" to ""I'm just going to go to the movies"". There is no real way the teacher could stop them. Many students lack self-control, or need to be taught it. These students would never learn that they can not just leave because something bores them. All, but especially young students would find focusing extremely difficult when not being held accountable.

Suppose the distractions are not an issue. A student sits down at his computer, switches it on, and is greeted by a neon light and artificial sounds. After the lecture, the student reaches out, switches the screen off, and takes a nap. This seems completely fine, but the student is missing a very crucial step; actual human interaction. This is vital for any functioning adult. No matter what job one has, they will always have to interact with another human. If a students life consists of just wake up, eat, watch a lecture, do the work, eat, go to sleep, then they miss out on human interaction other than their direct family for nearly eighteen years. That is absolutely not an ideal trade for the luxury of learning from home.

Some classes are altogether impossible to attend online. How would any musician learn to play in a group? Would they turn up the computer volume all the way just to hear a few other people? How would they play together if there is a delay in transmission? That completely rules out all of the musical department. What about workshop classes? Are the students expected to purchase thousands of dollars of machinery just to do a school project? Now the only classes available online are the ones that just pump your head full of words and facts. Nearly all schools also have extracurricular sports. These sports are much cheaper and easier to participate in than private clubs. Online, students can not exactly throw a baseball to each other. They would instead have to pay hundreds of dollars, even if they made they very selective tryouts.

After reviewing the negatives of the situation, it is apparent that they outweigh the positives. Just for the convenience of not leaving ones bed to take a class, one would have to give up human interaction, easily accessible activities, and the ability to distinguish a place of work from a place of rest. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
F21A02C66DAB,"It's hard enough for us to get our homework done as it is. There are too many distractions a home. Some students don't have access to the same resources at home that they have at their schools. Students would miss out on experiences and memories that would otherwise be made at their schools. Attending classes from home would not be beneficial for students.

Students around the world have different stories. They have different things that they go through day in and day out, and the distractions that they have at home aren't usually well known by other people. Whether it's financial issues, domestic violence, or even extracurricular activities. Students face different challenges, and they go through different trials and tribulations every day. For many students, school becomes a place to escape all of the stress that they experience at home.

Some students are in a place where they don't have access to certain things that could help them through their education. For example, not all towns have libraries in a close proximity that they can go to when they need a certain book. Schools usually have libraries and other ways to accommodate their students' needs. Another example is that not all students know what their next meal will be. Schools that provide free lunches eliminate this issue. Not having access to the abundant advantages that students get while going to a physical school can really ruin some students ways of life.

Many teachers and professionals might even say that school is more about the experiences and memories made than it is about the education you leave with. This is because there are many lessons to learn that aren't to be had in the classroom, but are rather gained throughout your interactions with those around you and in your classes. All kinds of events from a homecoming dance or senior prom, to a pep rally or a Friday night football game. All of them have takeaway moments for participants and for spectators alike. It might be harder to have those experiences, to make new friends, and to learn certain lessons from home.

While there are certainly students that can handle taking online school, distance learning is not worth the risk for the majority of students. This is because they might not be able to handle the pressure that comes with it. There are many disadvantages to taking online school. Experiences and memories will not have been made as they would have been at a nromal school.",5,Distance learning,Independent
80F2427F337D,"Distance learning is a method of teaching where students are not required to come to a class; however, they stay at home and watch the class through an online video or conference. While this may seem like a great alternative to having to get up early each morning and attend school everyday, it actually could have unintended consequences on the child. There are three main downsides to this form of online learning; those being that there could be more distractions at home than in the classroom, there would be less one on one time for the student and teacher, and the student would have a harder time making friends.

In a traditional school setting students may have trouble concentrating on the lesson because they want to talk to their friends. This issue will only be amplified if distance learning is used because there are even more distractions at home for a child. One of the main distractions would be the child's family and pets. If the child is part of a big family it may be hard to concentrate with the noise. The same issue would appear if the child has a baby in the house due to the baby crying or playing. The student may additionally be distracted by his or her own toys. If the child is watching the lecture in their room they may have the urge to play with their toys that are across the room. Students in normal schools are not allowed to be on their phones during class, but in this situation they could easily be on their phone without anyone ever knowing. If the class is only accessible online the students must have internet access. When the power is out or their internet is not working the students will not be able to learn. These distractions would all lead to students not paying enough attention in class and not retaining the information taught.

One more huge set back for children would be the lack of one on one time with the teacher. When teachers do not have each student sitting in front of them it would be hard to tell who actually understands the subject and who does not. In a traditional school teachers can go around the room and ensure that each child is doing his or her work correctly and if they are not he or she can help the student. With distance learning the teacher has no way of walking around the classroom and helping individual students. The student and teacher may be able to video chat and or email; however, that is not the same as having someone help you in person. Students normally form relationships with their teachers and are able to talk to and trust them. This type of relationship is not achievable with distance learning because students do not have the time between classes and after school to talk to their teacher like they would ordinarily. This absence of a relationship would become a problem especially if a student ever needed a recommendation from the teacher, because the teacher would not fully know the student.

Within a normal education system students have a few minutes between classes, recess, gym, and time on the bus to talk. This is not the case with distance learning, because there is no way for students to talk unless they go though the hassle of getting each others numbers and texting. While school is supposed to be a place to learn about subjects like math and English, it actually teaches kids how to make and keep friends. This is a lesson that it is very hard for a child to learn only from their family, because those relationships are different than friendships. Without the knowledge of how to build friendships in school kids have a much more difficult time forming relationships in life. By having only online classes, where students can not communicate face to face with each other, they are not learning how to build these important relationships with their peers, which will ultimately effect their adult relationships as well.

Distance learning in theory appears to be a new and better approach to learning and school in general, but, as previously mentioned, there are many unintentional side effects that hurt students. There are some up sides to this method such as no need for transportation and more free time for the child; however there are also downsides such as more distractions and less one on one time with teachers. Ultimately, distance learning has more bad effects than beneficial ones and therefore should not be used instead of the present school system. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
