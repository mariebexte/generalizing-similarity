04D653441263,"Online education has always been a controversial subject with the risk of not understanding the material, and students getting answers from their peers most of the popluation seem to be against the possibility. However, I believe there are new ways to look at the subject. The pros for online education are very proactive to the needed change in the school system these things are flexibility, time management and, mental health.

As a current student at a in person educational school, I have first-hand experience on how time consuming school may 6 be. An online education means that you are being told what you need to have done here before a certain time and, how you are expected to do so. It throws away the possibility of time consuming dialogue that students may have with other students or the teachers getting off topic with a personal story. Doing these little things that happen frequently can turn an 8 hour system into 3 hours. In the mist of giving these students 5 more hours in the day that is 5 more hours for students to work, hang out with friends, do chores and etc. These little things let us teenagers be teenagers just a little while longer. Adding to things such as, the employment rate, students taking college classes during high school, and the amount of teens volunteering. It gives teen the ability to be more flexible with their lives which is what we should strive for.

Secondly, When giving a student their own time to finish their work and nothing but the guilt of not getting a good grade being their motivation, there will always linger the question of ""Will they get it done?"". To that I asked, is school not meant to teach us the tools we need to survive the ""adult world""? As teenagers we are always told to learn the importance of time management before we get into our careers and even college. However, there are no courses for these types of things but, instead we are expected to learn them through first-hand experience and natural growth. This online school will teach students their obvious subjects such as Math, English and etc but they will subconsciously teach the importance of time management. Students will be expected to finish these lessons on their own because, if a teens prefers to do their work early in the morning in about 2-3 hours does it matter that they're possible hanging with their friends all night. These helps us teens understand the importance of time management without throwing it in their face they subconsciously come to that conclusion on their own.

Lastly, the importance of mental health in the education system is lacking and to be quite blunt is part of the problem. Most, adults may argue that this is a false narrative because of the of outlets that the education system may offer to students. However, my question is ""Do these outlets reach out and succeeded to out way the bullying and stress of a normal public school?""

because the answer is ""No."". As student at a public school the amount of work that is pilled on and the emotional stress of bullying enough to fall into depression. However, these problem turn into other problems for example, as a teenager your friends become and big part of your life in terms of what makes you happiest. What the current education system fails to realize is that two days of seven are not enough to truly cherish your time. Online school eliminates the possibility of those students who are to busy because of school work and because of it have no social life.

To concluded, Online school is and will most likely always be a controversial topic for as long as those who have been to in person school are around. However, I believe it's a matter of noticing that the pros of this new way of thinking out way the cons. These truly serious issues are being over looked because our older generation are extremely set on the mind-set that all generations need to grown up as they did. Let's look to innvoatote new ways. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
872AED166FA6,"With a world that is so technologically advanced and expanding everyday; change and adaptation come naturally to so many aspects of life. Integrating computers and different devices into school systems has made schooling easier and more efficient, but things can always get better. Offering distance schooling would help lots of students and could change the education system for good. This would help students who have a hard time showing up to school, students with anxiety and other mental heath issues, and decrease the amount of time wasted with in classrooms. Even if not for all students, this would lead students to better futures with less problems.

There are many students who find it hard to show up to school everyday; whether that be from sickness or lack of motivation. Attendance can be very low for some and grades can suffer severely. Some mornings going to school can seem like the hardest thing to do, and many students decide to just not show up. This is where distance schooling comes in. Being able to complete work online helps reduce a large portion of the stress that school brings. This also helps students who are sick or physically injured, who can not make it to school, keep up with their work. Students who often need medical attention and miss large amounts of school can find it very hard to stay at the same pace as their peers. These students miss valuable class time where their instructor is lecturing or explaining a unit and they can't get that time back. Online schooling ensures these students are getting the education they need while still being able to miss class.

Teenage years can be very confusing for some and lots of high school students suffer from anxiety or other mental heath issues. This can make going to school very hard for some students can worsen their disease. Going to school with anxiety can be hard; being surrounded by people you are not familiar with and feeling like you are being judged by them can make it very hard to concentrate on school work. There are also many students with depression who some days can't get out of bed let alone go to school. being able to complete work online makes it so those students can chose when they get their work done and allows them to be in control which can really help their situations. Some one could argue and say separating these students from their peers could cause their disease to worsen or cause them to have poor social skills, but there are many ways to get around this. Activities like sports and clubs keep that social interaction alive and with so many technological advances making friends online is easy and done right can be safe. School also creates an atmosphere where a person can feel like they can't be themselves; online schooling takes this away; which can help a persons confidence level and cause making friends in person to be much easier. The students I have met in the past, that have been home schooled and separated by their peers, have actually been some of the most outgoing people I have come to know. These students have had no problems when faced with social interaction.

There is also a big issue with the wasted time during each school day. Little things like bell changes, class clowns, and waiting on other peers add up quickly and can waste a lot of time during the day. Having distance schooling allows students to go at their own pace. If a student needs to go over a topic again they can without taking time from other class members. It also eliminates distractions from the class and allows the teacher to focus on teaching or helping students rather than babysitting the class. There would be no need for teachers to have to stop class and wait for the attention of their class since each student will be in their own home. Each student would be able to set the pace for their education and many students would be able to finish their classes faster and possibly graduate earlier.

There are so many benefits from offering distance schooling and it could change the way we educate our youth. Schools wouldn't have to worry about attendance issues, students with metal health issues would have an easier time getting an education, and there would be no wasted time within the classroom. Online schooling for students is better for everyone overall and could cause our future generations to have better life altogether. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
416A62A2D2C8,"Students would benefit from being able to attend classes online. When a student is sick, or simply can not attend class, they can just go online and be present digitally. Sometimes, kids are not comfortable with attending school. They can just stay home and get the same material as someone who would go to school. In today's world we should take advantage of the technology we have, and use it to give everyone the opportunity to learn.

Once, in the 7th grade, I obtained this horrible sickness that lead me to be absent for two whole weeks. When I got back, I was so behind in my class work. This lead to my grades slipping, and having to get tutors to just pass my classes. The simple solution to this problem is attending classes while I was home on my computer. I could of video conference in all of my classes to maintain where I needed to be for that year. also, I could of further analyzed the class by going to the school website and seeing what my teacher had uploaded for studying.

My brother, Generic_Name, was bullied harshly in middle school. People would make fun of him because he was overweight and had red hair. Some days, he would come home crying, because of how cruel everyone was to him. This could of lead to permanent psychological damage to my brother, luckily he recovered. The simply way of avoiding this problem was attending an online school. He could of avoided his bullies by doing this. When the first incident occurred he could of just finished that school year online, away from his troubles.

on the other hand, you need to present in the classroom to get the full learning experience. You can't just simply not attend school and expect to learn everything online. You need a teacher to further explain the subject you are being taught, and for them to answer any questions that the students has to ask. For my brother's problem, he needed to face his bullies and stand up for himself. You can't just hide away from your problems in life. problems you face in school is good life lessons that you will learn from.

In all, online schooling is great opportunity for students to have in school systems. It helps with sick days, tragic experiences and catching up on work. Plus, being able to work online can allow you to go at your pace, so you don't feel rushed. This distance learning may have some tweaks that needs to be fixed, but students do benefit from attending classes from home.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Better or worse?

Offering distance learning is very beneficial towards students, it offers more freedom, the environment is less stressful, and students would not have to wake up early to arrive at school. In an online class a student would have more freedom towards their assignments. Students could finish their work in a much faster and productive pace without any in class distractions. Teachers would also benefit from this as they would be able send the worksheets via email without printing all of them off for a in school class. Students would also be able to make a schedule that works for them. This would allow them to put their most important classes in the order that would help their work the most.

In an online class, the environment would be much less stressful. The students would not feel obligated to ""fit in"" with their peers through clothes, hair, and reputation. These examples cause many students stress that may lead to influencing the level of work they do. In an online course, the students would not have that stressful environment holding them back from achieving their fullest potential. This less stressful environment would help teachers with losing their students work. In an online class everything is in a folder or an email so it would be much easier to find an assignment that was not turned in.

Students would not have to wake up as early for online class vs in school. Many students(especially High School) suffer from the annoyance of waking up early. Everyday kids have to wake up at 5:30 AM just to go to school. At 5:30 AM many students are going to be half dead and just plain exaughsted. In online school, students would have the option to wake up later and attend the same class but just virtual. This would help students with their work and overall attitude during the day. For example, Many students play sports and some have practices that end at 10:00 pm, these students have to go home and get ready to sleep, which many teenagers struggle with especially after a practice. Most of these students will not be able to sleep until about 11:30 PM because their brain hasn't settled down yet. This would only give a student 6 hours of sleep before they need to wake up for school. 6 hours is 2 hours less than the average sleep that a teenager needs. Through online school, many teenagers could wake up and get started at 8:30 AM with a much healthier lifestyle. Overall, Online would help students with school far better than a regular public school. Every school should offer this choice if a student would like a better work environment. Online school helps Students reach their fullest potential.

F19F66A28B7E,"Many parents home school their kids. I would agree that if students took classes from home it would benefit them. Some of my reasons why they would benefit from home is that there would be less bullying at schools. Also, you would catch less viruses and not get sick as often. It would also release stress off students.

Bullying has become a massive problem at schools. Many teens have taken their own life because they would get bullied everyday at school. If we would home school our kids more often then there would be less bullying at schools. They wouldn't have to face that group of people that bully them or maybe just that one kid that shows up everyday to just bully your kid. Some children just forget about school in general and don't want go anymore or they just care less about their grades because what their worry about most is that bully and not about school anymore. Also, I feel that children would get their work done faster and have less stress then other students that go to public schools and they would get better grades because they have more time study. Critics would argue that if students get home schooled they wouldn't get to go out explore the real world. Also, they would fear to talk to people they don't know and only talk to people they do know and that would affect the way the interact with others and could effect the way they attend colleges or interviews for jobs or colleges. Many students feel that you don't need to know a lot of people to be happy. All you need is your family to support you in school and out in the real world. Also, your parents could help you with somethings you wouldn't understand at school. One more benefit of being home schooled is that your would spend more time with your family members and could focus more on school.

Another reason why being home schooled is a benefit is that you would not catch the virus that's going around. Many students get sick because they go to public schools. If your parents would home school you that would prevent you from getting sick or maybe you catching that deadly virus. you wouldn't be interacting with other students and that would be good for your system which means not getting sick as often. If you do get sick you would be home schooled so you could do your work at anytime and turn it in at anytime with out getting points deducted. Critics would argue that many students would get sick still. They could become home sick and would want to go out and still catch that deadly virus going around. Also, being home sick could affect the way you learn at home. Many students could say that if you do get home sick you could you just go to your backyard and just sit their and enjoy the sun for a little while. Also, you would be able to go out and where a mask which many schools don't let you do that. If you are home schooled chance are you wouldn't catch a deadly virus as easy as a public school student.

Overall, students that get home school have more benefits than public school students. They wouldn't get bullied as easy as public school students. Also, they would not catch a deadly virus as easy as public schools and many home school students would have less stress than public school students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7B864858BC20,"As technology increases throughout the years, more and more opportunities seem to open up for the public. One of these opportunities is the ability to attend classes at home, by way of video conferences or online courses. However at first glance this may seem like a great idea, there is always an argument that can be made about whether or not these new ideas are beneficial or hurtful. Although some may argue that attending classes from home is not a good idea because students miss out on beneficial social interaction, attending classes from home is a good idea because students work at their own pace, make their own schedule, and avoid consequences from missing school .

To begin with, attending online school or participating in video lectures is beneficial because it allows students to work at their own pace. One of the biggest problems in schools today is that students are forced to work at a pace that is set for them by either their teachers or the other students in their classes. For example, if several students do not understand a subject that is being taught while the rest of the class does, the teacher is likely to move on without helping the, ""slower students."" By taking the courses online these students are able to work at their own pace and can seek help without wasting class time. Although it may seem as if only struggling students can benefit from working at their own pace, smart students can also benefit by working at their own pace. Smart students are often trapped doing useless work and listening to pointless lectures, due to the fact that they already understand the subject that is being taught. By taking online school these students can avoid this predicament and move on whenever they are ready. The ability for a student to work at their own pace is necessary in order for them to reach their full academic potential.

In addition, attending classes from home is beneficial because students get to choose their own schedule. If a student were to take classes at home, they would be able to do schoolwork and learn whenever they please. Also, these students would likely be able to accomplish a days work in a time span much shorter than a school day's. This flexibility means that students would be able to spend much more time doing other important things. For example, a student could do online school and still have the time to follow their dream of playing junior ice hockey. Students would also be able to work more hours at a job, which could help them save up for their next level of education or contribute towards paying bills that their family may be struggling with. Online school is beneficial because it allows students to prioritize things in a much more flexible fashion.

Furthermore, taking courses online allows students to avoid the consequences of missing school. Some students are required to miss school due to health issues, sports, or even family vactions. Although these absences are often times excused, students are forced to suffer the consequences of missing class. Some of these consequences can be receiving zeroes on missed classwork, being forced to attend school on the weekends, and being required to take finals at the end of the year. If these students were able to make up for their missed class time by taking classes at home, they would not have to suffer these unfair consequences. For example, my sister has torn her ACL and has had appendicitis during her senior year, causing her to miss a large amount of days. She is now being forced to go to school on Saturdays in order to make up for her missed days. If she were to make up the classes at home she would not be forced to attend Saturday school and miss important days of work. Taking classes at home is a great alternative to the consequences that are given to those who miss school

In conclusion, taking courses at home is beneficial because it allows students to learn at their own speed, make their own agenda, and avoid the consequences of being absent. If more students were to take classes from home, then they would be much more productive and smarter. If your school does not offer an option to take courses online, ask them to look in to making it an option.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
AF9AE164D6BC,"Not many people enjoy waking up at 6am, then having to go to a building and work for 8 hours straight. Despite all the positive things about public school, there are still many negative factors. Such as: Students being bullied, students needing to help out at home, some students being parents or just the simple resentment of leaving their house. ""Distance learning"" or online school as most people refer to it as, is an amazing form of schooling and is something students can really benefit from. Learning in the comfort of your own home is a great alternative to public school, especially for high school students who are transitioning into their adult lives and might need the 8 hours they would be spending at school for something else.

Firstly, students taking a class from home have a much better opportunity to actually absorb the information due to them being allowed to move at their own pace. In public school, students must move at the teachers pace; when the teacher finishes the lesson the student has no choice but to move on and take the test at the end of a unit; however, online you would be able to revisit the lesson if there was anything you were unsure of. Vice versa, some students move faster than others but are forced to go at a slower pace to accommodate the other students instead of being able to move on when they are ready. It's very important for one to be able to move at their own pace, no two brains are the same; therefore, it's much more difficult to learn at someone else's pace. For example, if a teenage mother who is running off of 3 hours of sleep was to be in a class with a student who gets 8 hours every night, they most likely would not be able to learn at the same pace due to one of them being exhausted and the other having a full nights rest.

Stress takes a huge toll on students in school, which causes their grades to drop, which could lead to depression. Another reason online school would be beneficial, is because it'd be a lot less stressful. At school students stress about more than academics, things that also stress them out could be: friends, what they wear, how they look and social anxiety. Online school would be less stressful because students wouldn't have to deal with all of that behind a screen, which would keep their focus on their academics resulting in better grades. Social anxiety creates many problems, some students might be afraid to speak up if they're having trouble with something or simply just to ask to go to the bathroom. Being in a setting where they're practically forced to be social could cause panic attacks and mental breakdowns. Hypothetically speaking, this could lead to depression; which could make a student lose the desire to leave the house and just want to be alone. To prevent multiple unexcused absences, online school could help in this situation; they would still be learning and ""attending class"" but this way, they get to do it in the comfort of their own home.

In conclusion, online school is a great alternative to physically being in school. There many beneficial factors to it; although, public school is the more traditional option, distance learning should not be completely ruled out when choosing a school. It gives students a lot more freedom and control over their education, which also should be the case in public school; but sadly, is not. Online school can help the mental health of today's youth and maximize their understanding of the content they learn; this form of learning should be normalized in society.       ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F2799C0DBF24,"Taking classes online always has its pros and cons for students. Distance learning would benefit students in many ways and save them lots of time! I believe that taking classes at home would help students extremely much with basic stuff such as time management and finishing work. Video conferencing would be very nice to have with online classes so you and your teacher can communicate when needed. The video conferencing would also be great for group projects so if you have nowhere to meet, you can just call each other.

When you take online classes it usually results in students getting more sleep. Students will get more sleep because there would be no need to rush to get ready in the morning. This is very beneficial because students will wake up well rested and will be able to knock out those online classes like it's nothing. Distance learning also saves time because you won't have to drive to school or take the bus. Which also saves money if you have a car. For students who struggle with waking up and getting the sleep they need, taking online classes can help you very much with that.

For some students, online classes could help with their mental health. That is because online classes tend to be less stressful and that could help many students in the United States. At home you can take multiple breaks to rest your brain before starting again. As long as you stay caught up with the online class you won't have to worry. More students could find it helpful than you think. There's a lot of teenagers who can let their emotions get to them and they don't have that health mentally that all students should have. I just believe that giving online classes could help everyone in their own ways and succeed with it.

Online classes would also be great for students that do not enjoy the social aspect of school. Not everyone enjoys the loudness and chaos that schools have. Online classes would be a great way for students like that to really excel without distractions around them. Obviously there would still be video conferencing to communicate with the teacher so not complete silence but there's no students being loud around you. Nobody enjoys trying to do work when students around them are being loud. Why let these students distract you when you can go home, work in silence, and get stuff done? That's why online classes help everyone in their own significant ways.

I believe that many students should try distance learning and see how it benefits them. By staying at home and taking online classes it can help a single student very much. This is because you'll get more sleep, mental health, and silence for worksheets and homework. More schools should offer distance learning for all these reasons and more! The schools should help the students as much as they can and help them reach their full potential.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
C87A23D05F39,"Online learning has rapidly become a major part of modern-day education, with almost all high schools offering online courses, and every teacher uploading notes on school websites. Many educators argue that students are more than capable of learning from the comfort of their own home, rather than in a crowded, large classroom. ""Flipped"" classrooms have also risen, with students taking notes and doing work at home, and then reviewing during class time. Many new issues, however, can arise when students take courses from their own home. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because households are not suitable atmospheres for learning, having real teachers is more beneficial for the learning process, and it encourages academic dishonesty.

Primarily, students would not benefit from taking classes from home because households do not provide a suitable atmosphere for learning. The main point of school buildings is to have a steady spot where the young student mind knows it must focus on classwork and asking questions. Over 75% of students set up a desk or work space of some sort in their homes where they go to stay on task. Similarly, school buildings provide a space where the primary focus is learning. That atmosphere is created through regulations, such as no phones during lecture, or no talking during quizzes. At home, the student is entirely in charge of their own learning process, which would naturally cause them to get distracted often. Adult minds easily slip off task when they get a notification on their phone, and younger minds are even more likely to get distracted. One notification is enough to divert a student's attention completely. The average student spends at least 5 hours on their phone a day, checking messages, posts, and videos. In a school building, teachers and staff are available to keep students on task, while at home, constant distractions can easily alter the focused atmosphere.

Another reason why students would not benefit from taking classes from home is because having real teachers is more beneficial for the learning process. It is a common known fact that talking through a problem offers more opportunity for growth and understanding. Although a course's material may be looked through over and over online, most students require a teacher to clear up a topic or review difficult concepts with. In a household setting, a student's questions may remain unanswered, especially if it is about a specific topic or question. Having a teacher or professor available makes it easier for teachers to fully explain any topic for any student having difficulties. By having lingering questions, students continue making the same mistakes out of habit, even if the question was answered later on. In a household, the absence of a teacher makes it difficult for a student to clear up any misunderstandings or questions, thereby negatively impacting their learning process.

Lastly, taking classes from home would not be beneficial for students because it would encourage academic dishonesty. Unfortunately, almost 80% of adults admit to cheating their way through online courses taken through college. Whether it is because of too much stress or simple laziness, courses taken at home, with the absence of any guidelines, make it incredibly easy for a student to cheat on any assignment or exam. Not only does this ruin the education process, but it creates a habit of dishonesty in a person that is difficult to break. Almost every student reprimanded for cheating in high school cheats again within the next 13 months, and eventually the cycle carries on into the workplace. At a house, every answer is just one click away, and the student has no consequence for cheating. Not only does the student not learn, but they continue to keep the notion that dishonesty still brings rewards.

In conclusion, although online learning has a few benefits, it's overall impact is detrimental to a student's learning process and habits they carry on through life. A household is incapable of providing the same atmosphere that a school provides for learning, and the presence of teachers and staff give a clear way for students to communicate and fully understand topics they may struggle with. Although technology has advanced enough for students to comfortably study and learn, the risks that accompany online learning outweigh the benefits by far, and therefore online courses and learning are detrimental to not only students now, but society in the future.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8E053EA4FE6F,"Should schools offer distance learning? I think yes because first of all the counties would be saving numerous amounts of money. One we wouldn't need to worry about buses no more, transportation it self is probably very expensive. We as students wouldn't have to get up so early no more we could chose what time we start learning. Also students wouldn't have to worry about disgusting school lunches the county would be saving more money, because students would be at home making their own food at the comfort of their own house. They also wouldn't have to worry about bad friends no more.

If schools were using video conferencing it would be so much easier for students to get ready for school. Students would just have to brush their teeth and then they would sign in to their video conference website and they would just call their teacher. Also their would be less distractions it would just be one on one, teacher and student no classmates distracting each other. It would be more easier for students to learn also because the teacher could focus on the student, then the student would focus on teacher and get all of their assignments done, students will learn better if its one on one. It would also be much safer with all these school shootings happening in today's society.

Another thing students wouldn't have to be stressing about food getting them sick no more. Because the school lunches are just nasty and terrible. Students will be more comfortable at their home eating their food instead of the counties food. Think about all the money we could save with the website they could make. No one has to spend no more lunch money, on cheap food that will make your stomach hurt for a week straight.

Also we could stop bullying by starting this program up. Students wouldn't be able to get picked on no more because it would be a one on one conversation. Parents would not have to worry about bad influences on their child because they're child would be safe at home not with bad people at school. They wouldn't be around any other kids unless they go outside. Students will be more ready for the real world if we start this program.

If we start this program the county will be saving thousands of dollars and we could be spending that money we need in the world. If we start it students could chose a time in their day to start learning for at least four hours they would log in and say hello to their teachers through a screen. They would have to wake up at six o'clock in the morning then brush their teeth, then go pick a outfit they would like to wear in school. Instead of all that stress they could just wake up brush their, then make breakfast and if they wanted to start class now they could. This a terrific idea if the county starts a program like that. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
71CEE0DC98A3,"Online video conferencing in order to attend a class from anywhere can be very beneficial.

As we get older and technology becomes better and better, this is an easy task to execute.

All you need is two devices that can pair together.

As long as students are using their emails to communicate and their phone number isn't easily displayed than this is a resource that is very beneficial.

Video conferencing in classrooms are the future because, if a student gets sick, student gets suspended, and as long as it isn't full time, than it will change the way we educate children.

Everyone gets sick and has to miss school a couple days in the year; some more than others.

On those sick days kids just basically lay in bed all day and watch TV.

If they were able to watch a video of the classroom instead, the kid wouldn't have to worry about missing anything important.

Students come to school sick all the time for important college classes or fear of missing out, and thats how diseases spread.

If video conferences were an everyday thing than it would reduce the amount of people getting sick all over the world and especially make our classrooms safer.

Kids make bad decisions that dictate weather they will be attending school for the next couple of days, or even weeks.

Instead of a suspension being free time for them were they can do whatever they want, have them come to school over video conference.

It makes the suspension worth while.

Everyone can gain from it.

Students would be more inclined to follow the rules if they knew they would have to sit in front of a computer all day for their classes when they violate the rules.

All of this sounds good and beneficial but students will over use this or even not come to school at all.

Although this is an amazing resource, it is proven that face to face real life teachers are more effective.

If a student stayed home and did these video classes all year he/she wouldn't be retaining the information as well as the other kids. He/she will also be missing out on one of the most important factors of school, which is the social aspect.

Kids staying at home everyday wouldn't have to talk to any of their peers and learn how to develop relationships.

This will hurt them in the future and in the workforce when they have to work with other individuals.

Online video conferencing is a resource that must be used but their needs to be limitations.

If the correct limitations are applied than this concept could change the way kids learn for the better.

Especially now a days where mental health issues are at an all time high, one day off for yourself where your attending school from your couch doesn't sound all that bad.

Although this concept is already in some schools it needs to be used across all schools everywhere so students can maximize their learning experience.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BA7DFD2DC895,"The best experience from teenage students are at school. School offer fun activities for classes. Students can make so many friends when they are in school. Although some school offer online schooling, being in school is probably the better choice because students won't slack off at home and you do more fun activities at school with friends.

Getting home schooled isn't the safest choice for a student. Students now will usually have a cell phone or some electric device that would keep students distracted from taking their classes, or doing their work. Cheating could also effect their career because then they won't the stuff on the bigger test like the SOL and the SAT. Students might just slack off. Online classes probably won't teach them life lesson and have fun activities.

Schools have so much more to do than taking classes online at home. Students will always have help for questions at school and they don't have to look it up. In schools, students could always make friends and do lots of activities with them. There is never cheating on any test and quizzes.

Online testing isn't the best thing students, it's probably the less boring for them. They won't have to wake up as early as regular student does when they have school. Their classes have shorter time then regular schools. The best part is probably that you will always be home.

Students will have the most benefits when they are at school and not at home taking online classes. Online make students slack off and not do their work. In school, students will have friends and do fun activities. They will just have the best experience when they are at school.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
E16916B78B8F,"With the rise of technology, the attention span of students has decreased to eight seconds. The average attention span of a goldfish is nine seconds. Whatever the benefits of technology may be, raising a generation that is less focused than a goldfish is not justifiable. Students already have difficulties focusing in school and online learning will only provide more opportunities for straying from the topic being taught. Pairing this low concentration rate with distance learning, including the use of online or video conferencing, further worsens the issue. Although it may be said that distance learning provides accessibility or efficiency, these factors compromise the quality of education that students receive. Long distance learning would not benefit students because of the low retention capacity caused by technology as well as the fact that computers and other devices have a high chance of malfunctioning.

Video conferencing devices are prone to break, be hacked, or even stop working completely. This unpredictability poses a threat to students' ability to listen to lectures or complete any other online tasks given. Simply put, long distance learning is too risky in terms of technical issues and is not best used for an educational platform. If a device used for distance learning were to malfunction, it would need to be repaired, which can cost up to hundreds of dollars. Many students, especially people completing their tertiary education, may not be able to afford these expensive repairs. Long distance learning creates many ways for students' to miss a class or not fulfill a due date because of technical issues, which can only be harmful to their education. Attending school in person, however, does not require being dependent on the functionality of an electronic device. If long distance learning is meant to be more efficient, the extra time and money put into repairing a device in time seems counterproductive; clearly, this is not beneficial. Furthermore, it is extremely well-known how easily a technological device can be hacked. With one click on an email, a whole device can be infested by a digital virus. Obviously, the financial implications of this problem are a burden to students' as well as the possible missed content. Because of the lack of security and the fragile nature of video conferencing devices, long distance learning proves to have more risks to a student's education rather than advantages. Some people may say that cybersecurity measures maybe taken to prevent this from occurring, however, they fail to consider the fact that with new protection measures come new ways to surpass them.

Undoubtedly, people retain more information in person rather than over a video call. Being taught something when someone is physically speaking or being shown something in the same room as the teacher is far more efficient than an online system. Long distance learning deprives students the chance for hands-on learning and interacting with other peers along with the teacher. Multiple studies have proven that students learn better when performing interactive lessons or investigations related to the topic. On a personal level, I remember something that was taught to me through an experiment of hands-on lesson as opposed to a video or online notes. Being in a classroom with the teacher engages a student more and can even provide motivation to learn, compared to sitting at home and trying to absorb information through a video call as a part of long distance learning.

Consequently, there are countless distractions in the comfort of one's own home, while in a classroom students are forced to stay focused and complete all tasks at hand. In an educational setting, the environment is everything. On a psychological level, individuals have a relaxed and comforting connotation associated with their house, and long distance learning at home creates a environment not suited for education. On the other hand, a classroom setting is ideal for focus and attention. Long distance learning is detrimental to an understanding of the topic because of the conditions students attend the class in. Some may say that we live in an age of digitization, and education must keep up with technological advances, however, this development should not come at the cost of students' ability to comprehend their lessons.

After considering the claims made, it is clear that long distance learning does more harm than good in terms of an environment that allows students to understand the topics without distractions as well as the tendency of video conference devices to break or be hacked. In an age of technology, is is almost too easy for a device to malfunction, be attacked by a virus, or simply break. This is a waste of time and money that takes away from the purpose of long distance learning. Not only is attending a class online unreliable, but it also provides distractions and compromises the retention of information taught. Going to a class in person is unarguably the most effective way to gain a full understanding of the lesson. However, sitting at home while being taught an online lesson invites distractions, which decreases concentration. After all, no one wants to be less focused than a goldfish!",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
B2DAE4CC6597,"Today schools offer many tools or ways to complete your diary learning process. one of these tool is called ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"". Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not.

It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you can't. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we don't have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners.

Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students aren't going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend.

In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up.

All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life. In conclusion, school trains us as people, it teach us how to socialice and work.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EE1661BF8227,"Many school systems around the world have already started offering distance learning opportunities for their students in order to expand their opportunities to learn. These opportunities allow students to attend some of their classes from home through online resources or video conferencing and save them the hassle of attending school for the classes they wish to take. Schools should offer distance learning opportunities as they allow students to teach themselves how to self learn and allow students to take extra classes that they wish to take.

Firstly, a benefit of distance learning is that it teaches students the ability to self learn which is a key skill needed in order to succeed in life. Self learning is essential for people when they advance to the collegiate and professional levels as much of the information that they need to learn is not being taught by professors or superiors, but is instead being self learned by an individual to the point where they are comfortable with the information they have learned. Distance learning classes teach a person these skills in the earlier stages of learning as they allow students to learn the information without the physical presence of a teacher to constantly hand them information while allowing the presence of a teacher through the use of email or video conferencing to clarify doubts that students may encounter when they are learning. Self learning is a skill that is also important to apply in a person's daily life as they have to constantly figure out what they may be weak at and learn how to improve themselves without the guidance of another person. Without the opportunity for people to learn how to teach themselves at an early age and think about ideas on their own, many people will fail to advance in their adult lives as they do not possess the skill to advance in life without someone constantly guiding them.

Secondly, distance learning classes allow students the opportunity for students to take extra classes and expand their knowledge. Many schools only offer a handful of classes that exist which limits the opportunity for students to take classes about topics they wish to learn about. Distance learning classes allow students to broaden their knowledge in topics that interest them as they extend the opportunity to learn past the classes that schools offer and in some cases even allow students to create a solid foundation for their collegiate education and professional careers. Some students in school systems that do not offer distance learning opportunities are forced to take courses that are required for graduation instead of courses that interest them and this takes away from their chance to build a nice foundation for their post high school lives. If all schools offered distance learning, it would allow students to complete their graduation requirements early and allow for them to explore their topics of interest in a year long course that would help build their knowledge in their field of interest for their later stages of education and eventually their professional lives. The offering of distance learning classes by all schools would allow for many students to build a foundation in their field of interest and allow for many professionals to work at their optimum ability.

Some educators, parents, and students argue that distance learning classes limit a student's ability to learn as a result of there being no physical presence of a teacher. This is understandable, but schools are only offering this opportunity to students who wish to explore this opportunity of learning and are not forcing it upon anyone. Students would also have the access to interact with an instructor to clarify their doubts during their learning experiences in a limited manner to resemble the later stages of education where students are required to teach themselves all the knowledge with a professor or a superior being able to clear any minor doubts. Even though many people question the decision of schools offering distance learning opportunities, they serve as a preparation for college and are only offered to those feel they can handle the task of teaching themselves.

Distance learning opportunities are beneficial towards students as they prepare students for the next stages of their lives and allow students to expand their horizon and explore their topics of interest. This allows students to be better prepared for the knowledge that hits them in college and allows them to learn in an efficient manner and obtain more knowledge in their field of interest. If students in every part of the world were offered the opportunity broaden their knowledge in their field of interest, they would be able to learn efficiently at the collegiate level and allow them to obtain necessary skills for the professional world that would allow the world to be full of knowledgeable professionals and make the world a better place.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
B0CD65C0DE1D,"I believed students could be beneficial with online classes because, many people are used to travel a lot to take a class on campus, but since there is a way to do classes. I think it's better for many people that travels from a far place to the college to study their career. For Example if a students travel for 2 hours to get to the campus or college that student would be taking a lot of time to his class on campus, Many students that are on campus are paying for apartment and books etc, But online there is a better way to finish classes for graduation.

However, many students are willing to make online classes because there is a lot of stress when they travel from their house to campus and many students are stock in traffic or if there is a accident many students are not making it to their classes although many students are willing to take online classes than on campus. my reason is since their is technology in this world on this days to take many thing online for example their job, online classes, or talking to professors that are on different part of the world now with technology there is a better way to study or finish classes for our good purpose. also their is a way to communicate with teacher via video conferencing and that another easy way to take classes other way to take classes and just with your teacher not having more students. when you are with the teacher you are able to ask questions and the teacher will answer the questions that you are asking and have knowledge of what the teacher is talking about on his class, Not like on campus that there is a class full on students and its harder to ask a question to the teacher or ask for his opinion on what the subject is, as you would be online where its more easy and online can learn more since you are with just the teacher.

As students we have many responsibilities on college when we are paying our classes we have to go and finish them, As online there is more time to be with your teacher and talk about what the class is. also many classes online are just an 1 and a half and online there is a power point for the students to see what going on on the subject and could be easier to know the class or the teacher can show the studnt how to do certain jobs that would help when tey start to get a job and not having to be desing with other stuffs to get the job that we are been studying for.

In conclution to my response many students are willing to pay classes online and not going to campus to study, but for many people they prefer go to campus and study and have more time stuying on library or in classes. my opinion is that online classes could benefial students who are working and studiying at the same time since taking classes online or at home since we have thsi technology have to uset for our own good an not wasted on other stuffs and here are the best ways to study online you can wake up and just open your computer and take your classes and then do a different class or go to your job or go into the campus to get the books that are needed to take the class.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
1484F69AB31E,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students learn by different ways now especially with advances to technology. Many find learning from home appropriate and the best option for their leaning experience. The opposition wrongly believes students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of learning disabilities and also if a student has possible questions that need to be answered. Although some believe students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Students who attend classes from home are able to stay on task due to internal skills. One internal skill a student achieves from working at home is being more productive. To be productive means simply staying on task to get work done faster. An example of being productive is a student while attending school at home is given multiple assignments. However, the student exemplifies a sense of purpose and works to their fullest potential to get the work done in an orderly fashion. Next, students who attend classes from home are able to obtain time management. Time management means being able to work while using the time a person is given wisely. For example, a student might take classes at home but has to also make time for house cleaning, and their job. However, the individual creates a schedule to make sure they have time to do all of these tasks in a timely fashion. This shows that a student can gain time management skills because they are able to get basic house work done and at the same time prioritize school work. Finally, students who attend classes from home are able to obtain responsibility. Being responsible means doing the assigned work without being told to do it. For instance, a student who is assigned work does the work without being reminded by teacher or professor. This shows responsibility because some students realize that online school is an advantage that should not be taken for granted.

Students who attend classes from home are able to stay on task due to external benefits. One external benefit a student has from working home is less distractions. Distractions are people, animals , or things that limits and individuals way of staying focus. For example, students who take classes at home some might live by themselves. However, in some cases a quiet environment allows a student to focus and understand what they are learning. This allows them to get work done faster because at school there are multiple distractions around a person so its easy to get off task. Next, students who take classes at home benefit because it can potentially increase their grades. This means grades in a particular class would rise. For instance, a student might have a problem taking classes in school because they can not get decent grades. Therefore, they take classes at home which motivates them and because of that they have a different attitude and they start applying themselves. Which is the the turning point for them increasing their grades. Finally, students benefit from taking classes at home because they are able to work ahead of everyone. Working ahead means doing required work ahead of time before it is due. For example, a student doing grad point might take extra classes at home to get more credits. In doing this students are able to take classes ahead of others and once they get their required amount of credits they can possibly graduate early.

Even though some believe students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Opponents incorrectly think, students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of just pure laziness and a lack of motivation a person has. However, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to internal skills a student will achieve like productivity, time management, and responsibility. Additionally, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to external benefits like a chance at higher grades, less distractions, and being able to work ahead. Students should understand taking classes from home can argued as one of the greatest advances in today's society. Being able to work at home allows students to build skills needed for future careers and learn proper work ethic needed for certain jobs. Individuals should not take opportunities like this for granted and should work to their fullest potential if given this great opportunity.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8CB337D8D65C,"Should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschooled ?

In my honest opinion, I think student should benifit from being homeschooled is that, There would be less distractions then there are in an actual public schools or private schools then there are in Home school communities.

I think this true because there are alot of distractions in school and students do not realize that those distractions could be the cause of the reason as to why they are not learning and possibly why they might be failing their classes. For example, Students usually arrive late to class only because they hanging out with their friends in the halls and paying less attention to what their timely scheduele is at school, and if a student arrives late to class, They have missed part of what they are about to learn for the day and distract others from their learning.

Another reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be no attendance policy and you get to learn things faster. I think this is true because, There are always those types of students who always arrive to school/class late and have already missed out on half of the lesson only beacuse they couldn't get thereselves up in the morning just to get to school. Also, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time but it also distracts others who are trying to learn. If you get home schooled you are also learning things faster, Because, you don't have anybody holding you back from you learning time and you get to move on in a faster pace then others; For example, Say if some students cannot figure out how to complete a lesson, It just makes it slower for the class because everyone has to understand the subject in order to move on to the next portion of the lesson.

However, Reasons as to why I do not think students would benefit from going to school at home. The reason why I think this is true is because the amount of time of learning that would be set up at home would be diffrent at home then at school; for example, students might get to comfortable at home and might think they can get up from bed at whatever time they please. Another example of why a student would not benefit from going to school at home is because, the home school student would be distracted by their surroundings. Since the student is are very familiar with their enviroment at home, it would be very hard to pay attention and listen to what you are learning only because you are distracted of your familiar surroundings.

In Conclusion, These are all the reasons and examples as to why I think should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschoold.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
2EB94A444839,"Some schools offer an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools think that it is a benefit that help students who don't want to go school or if they have diseases, they can't go schools. Taking classes in home or schools have some similar benefits but not overall benefits.

Although, I think taking classes from home have benefits and not because some students have health problems and it is not a benefit because students can't learn good like in school.

At first, taking classes from home can be a benefit because it helps students who have health problems like students that have problems to walk or different disease. Also, for students that their parents don't let them to go for problems. For example, if students who have arthritis, they can't go to schools because they can't walk. It would be better for they because taking classes by online or they can make a video conferencing with a tutor. They can learn about all classes they want to know and it would be a benefit for their future because they will get a diploma that will be help for them. Also, it can be a benefit for students that had problems in schools like fight with others students. Those students can take classes in home with help of someone or by online. In this way, they can get help and learn things without go school.

Moreover, I think it is not a benefit for students who don't want to go schools because if they don't like the schools, they will be doing whatever they want because there won't be a teacher who tell them what to do; and they can't learn good because there are no one who explain them the class. There are many students who don't speak English and they don't want to go school but they want to learn. For example, I can't speak English so good because I am not a native American, so if I don't want to go school and want to learn the language, taking classes from home would be hard for me because in home I will learn slower than schools because in schools are many people speaking English and in home I just hear one time at day. It better if I hear English the most of the time because I can learn so fast because I will make friends to help me. For me, taking class in schools is better than home because now I go to school and it is hard even if I go to school. I am improving the language with help of teacher and friends.

In conclusion, taking classes from home is not a hundred percent a benefit. It just have some benefits for some students. For some students taking classes from home is hard because they don't learn too much. Overall, if I take classes in home or school, it is something relevant because even if I am in one or anther place, I am learning something. It is not a thing of other world. It is just for students that have the purpose to learn and be someone in life. Going to school help me to improve my life each day. Each day, I can learn something new and now my language is improving because I have people who want to teach me and I am a stronger person because no one can laughing of me because I am learning. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
8A745CBCD81E,"I do think students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home. My reasoning to why is because students could learn better in the comfort of their own homes, benefit from no distractions, and attending online classes can help students with social differences.

Therefore being comfortable can help your work ethic. When in the comfort of your own home it's better to study, read, and stay focused. For example around students or an area your uncomfortable with can stop you from doing your best. But if you are in a environment that your more comfortable with you can work better. When your comfortable you learn better.

Secondly the ability to benefit from home with no distraction is more cable then being in a school setting with distraction. For example you can choose where and when to learn in your home with no distraction at all. But in school the options are scares. When a student is surrounded by a lot of other students and staff the drive to stay focus can be limited. There also could be students who stop classes from learning by being very distracting tends to being at home with no distraction at all.

In addition attending online classes could help students with social differences. Sometimes students may have a problems speaking up or asking a question when confused because the pace of the class is way to fast. For example students with social differences can have trouble communicating in uncomfortable places. They can even have a panic attack when put on the spot to answer a question or present in front of the class. Instead taking online classes would really benefit. You wouldn't even have to worry about these things.

In conclusion I do think attending classes from home can benefit a student. For the same reason as students learning better in the comfort of their homes, having no distractions, and the fact that it can help a student with social differences. I believe attending classes from home can help in many different ways such as the ones that I included in my statement today. Thanks for reading and hearing my position on this issue.

EC1D25B7A42E,"Students will benefit from having the option to attend classes from home. There are several schools that offer the choice to learn from home and students have been able to benefit from it. Allowing students to have a choice in their education offers relief from forcing them to learn a certain way that brings them discomfort. Some may believe that offering distance learning is an awful idea because it keeps students from society, and while that may be true the option offers a unique way of learning. Students should be able to attend classes from home because it offers a comfortable environment for them to learn in, it gives them another way to learn, and it prepares them for a possible future.

While learning students should feel comfortable in the environment they are in and doing it from home allows them freedom from other outside pressures. Allowing students to attend classes from home removes stress from having to do assignments in a rush; however, there are certain programs that do have time limits for assignments, some give students a leeway to do them. For example, my cousin felt stress and discomfort at his school with the way he was learning, so my family moved him to online learning at home, and now he is in a better environment to succeed in his education. Some may believe that the way someone learns has nothing to do with their environment, and while it might be true, we can see how students can be affected by observing them. Furthermore, certain environments give prime examples of how comfort affects the way students receive knowledge.

In the world some people are not provided with many choices in how they want their life to be, so offering the option to students is a pleasant idea. Some children in other parts of the world do not get to have a choice in how they receive an education, so giving the option does matter. Each student perceives knowledge in a different way and because the world is changing with technology and the internet, attending classes at home by the way of online or video conferencing does not sound like such a horrific idea. There are people who do not like the idea of changing the way students learn because they are terrified of change, so offering the choice is a problem to many. Others have the belief that giving the choice to students on how they want to learn is an amazing idea because it allows them to have a say in how they want to go about their education.

One last benefit of allowing students to learn from home is that they will be prepared for the future if they decide to pursue a job or career that makes you work from home. While students are learning at home, they are also getting the experience of working at home and developing skills for the future. Although there are people who have the belief that working from home isn't actually a job because you aren't considered to be working; there are plenty of examples of people who work at home and have made successful careers from being at home. Plenty of people have made incredible careers from the experience of learning at home, so it is a possibility for those students who get the chance to learn at home. Students will have a chance to be prepared for a possible future if they so desire while getting a different learning experience from it all.

In conclusion, students will benefit in different ways from being offered the option to attend classes at home. Schools are allowing students to have a say in their education which is what matters because choices are considered to be something important. Attending classes at home allows students to have an option in the way they receive knowledge because it could be a fun, unique, and new way of learning for them. While students will be in a pleasant environment, will be given a choice, and will be prepared for something in a near future.

F739195A9518,"The freedom to make a hot cup of coffee while writing a book report, or watch a television series while doing math, undoubtedly sparks feelings of content among students. Throughout the country, some schools have worked to make this a reality, offering students the option of 'distance learning', which is a means by which students can take classes from home through online or video conferencing. In the 21st century, technological development is playing an increasingly larger role in several aspects of society, including educational institutions. The question of how and to what extent these innovations should be integrated serves as a subject for debate. Distance learning should not be an option for all students as it does not induce the same motivation as does a classroom setting, it creates the possibility for students to take advantage of the freedom, and students would not be given the chance to develop certain social skills necessary for their success in the real world.

One's home is, oftentimes, an environment which establishes a sense of comfort. This setting, compared to a classroom, removes the aspect of healthy competition among students and inhibits a student's drive to accomplish tasks through peer-to-peer interactions. For example, to the student at home, his or her own grade is the highest, as it is the only point of comparison for him or her. However, at school, academic competition among peers allows for students to push themselves outside of their comfort zone, achieving their highest potentials. Additionally, the motivation of a student who takes classes from home is less than that of a student in a classroom as students at school are more exposed to the opportunities that other students have taken advantage of, such as sports and extracurriculars. This allows a student in school become motivated to simply engage in more activities and accomplish more in his or her fields of interest. The interaction that school promotes creates motivation among students and allows them to engage in healthy competition, while accomplishments more in their academic career.

Beyond this, distance learning allows for students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which undeniably serve as a distraction to their academics. For example, at home, a student may be tempted to watch television, or take a nap as there is no teacher or administrator to effectively enforce certain rules and guidelines on the student. This situation makes a student's ability to stay on task extremely difficult, hence negatively impacting that student's success academically. However, if the student were taking classes at school, they are required, by the teacher, to focus on the lesson and complete tasks in a timely manner for their grade. Taking classes at home allows a student to procrastinate their assignments, with no tangible consequence. Because of this, distance learning allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which, in the long run, has a unfavorable effect on that student's academic success.

Furthermore, taking classes at home hinders students' development of social skills, which are beneficial to the success of individuals in the real world. For example, students at school are frequently required to make presentations and connect with other students for group projects. At school, students can also ask their peers for help or advice on assignments. These opportunities at school sculpt a student's ability to develop imperative inter-personal skills, while promoting sociable behavior among students. Through distance learning, however, a student is not exposed to these situations; therefore, they are unable to make the same connections and develop these skills necessary for college or the real-life situations. Although supporters of distance learning may argue against this point by claiming that taking classes at home could be made a possibility for younger students in elementary school as they are generally not required to give presentations, this claim is unsupported as several important social skills are developed at a very young age, according to several studies regarding brain connections. Through distance learning, a student is unexposed to opportunities for developing integral social skills, which are necessary for his or her success in the future.

Distance learning, the concept of making at-home classes an option for students, is unsupported due to the fact that it does not promote the same motivation as a classroom, allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, and does not allow student's to develop their interpersonal skills. These factors would negatively influence a student's academic success, which is irrefutably counter-intuitive to the intended purpose of educational institutions. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
2127D8777A44,"Schools will stop students from succeeding if students learn online. Many schools are now allowing students to attend classes by video conferencing and other online ways. Students in certain schools have not just taken, but also passed core classes along with electives through online programs. Teachers use video calling applications like Skype or FaceTime to teach and educate students. Students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable.

One reason that students should not learn online is because there are too many distractions in a students home for them to focus entirely on the subject at hand. For an example, if a student has younger siblings running around their work space at home, the student will not get a proper education because they will be constantly distracted. Another reason that students should not learn online is because students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom. There are tons of online applications that help students cheat on tests and even simple worksheets given out by educators. If a teacher cannot physically see the student right in front of them taking a test or working on a paper, then that teacher cannot be sure that the student does not have an electronic device present that is helping them get all the answers off of the internet. The final reason that students should not learn online is because the internet is unreliable. When a student is working online, their internet might not always be stable, WiFi might not always be available in the students home, the teacher and students devices might not always be compatible with one another, and finally, the student might not always have access to a device.

Many people believe that schools should offer long distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, however, students should not be able to attend online classes or use video conferencing as a way of education because there are too many distractions in a students home, students can cheat much more easily when they are in their home rather than a classroom, and the internet is not reliable. Students should stick to the traditional way of learning, it has worked for hundreds of years in the past. We should not change the way of our education system if their is nothing wrong with it to begin with.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
92DFAC1BCB02,"As students get older they start not wanting to go to school so, some schools started offering online video conferencing as a alternative for this problem. Therefore, some might say that video online conferencing would help students because they can learn from home. But, students would not actually benefit from online video conferencing because the lack of physical interaction and the distractions at home.

If students started to do online video conferencing, they would lack physical interaction. Some people might think that this is great for the shy students. But, if the teacher is not present the students wouldn't ask questions and the teacher wouldn't be able to physically help them with a problem. Also, the students wouldn't have one on one time with the teacher. Students need one on one time with the teacher so they can understand what they are learning and so that the teacher can help them individually. Furthermore, students need hands on learning. Hands on learning is important because it gives the students a general idea what the actual work is like so they can learn it and understand it better.

Additionally, students would be distracted by the activities and objects at home. Students would not pay attention to what they are learning if they are on their phones. Student are always on their phones, they text and check social media everyday. The teacher would not be able to punish them if they are on their phones during a lecture or while the teacher is teaching a lesson because the student is not physically there. The students would also be distracted by their parents. Their parents could be a distraction by interrupting the student while in a lesson. The parents could ask the student to do chores like: take out the trash, do the dishes, or even take the dog on a walk. Furthermore, students would get distracted by their pets. Pets are very unpredictable so, the student doesn't know what the pet is going to do. The pet could make a mess or just be really noisy. Pets would take the attention away from the lesson the teacher is trying to teach.

Students shouldn't start doing online video conferencing. Students should go to school and have physical interactions with other students and teachers with less distractions. Schools should step into another direction to make students want to go to school again. The Department of Education should act now to bring students to their facilities.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F05C641B8FF4,"imagine if u could do your school work from home and you didn't have to go to school. you can do your work at any time. although schools are the place of learning but we need a new way of learning. students should benefit from being able to do their school work from home because if a student is sick, they can do their work form home, students dont have to get up so early for school, and they can do it when they want to.

if a student is sick in bed, they can do their work at home. for example, a student has the flu and they cant go to school. they can go home and do the school work there and when they get better. they can go back to school and they will be caught up. anther example, a student has cancer and he has to stay at home. he can do his school work in his bed and he can get treated at the same time.

students dont have to get up so early for school. for an example, Generic_Name is a good student and he has good grades in school. but Generic_Name didnt want to go to school because he wanted to sleep in. he woke up at 12 in the afternoon and said, ""i need to do my school work before i do anything else"". so he did his work at home and did it first. anther example, a student has a job and work 9 hours a day. he didnt get home until 1 in the moring. he want to sleep in and not go to school.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
09F294EFAFC2,"I do not belive students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Society is constantly changing with technology, which is why its understanable for the masses to go the more efficent route, but being efficent does not outwiegh the numerous cons posed if one decides to choose online scholing. Attending classes from home can lead to health problems, lack of social interaction as well as not gaining the most in dept schooling due to the lack of personal interaction.

Online schooling can be linked to many health problems. Public schooling allows a student to keep a set scheduale of their day to day activites. It allows for a student to have a daily routine, with online schooling this routine is harmed. Most likely the student will lounge at home until an assigment is to be completed, there is nothing pushing the child to get up from their bed. Health risk become abdunt in this atmosphere. Diabites and heart failure are most present in todays society, the efficency allows for no hard work or strive. One becomes increesingly lazy as everything around them requires little effort. Humans genetic makeup forces them to look for the easiest possible route not the most beneficial route. Health problems are gonna constantly surrond a person if they make little effort to leave their house, you house is filled with indulgences ranging from youre bed to the food in you fridge, one must distance themselves from that. Online schooling requires much discipline, something most of society lacks.

Attending classes online limits the amount of social interaction one has with its enviorment. In school learning allows a student to interact with its classmates and fellow peers. Learning within an enviorment surrondeed by friends and classmates allows for one to learn about social cues and interactions, If one is stripped from this privledge they will lack the nesscary steps that will help them gain a better future. Social interaction is what builds a person, extroverted or introverted one needs to interact with its own species. Online schooling prevents this from happening, many introverted people will never be able to gain nesscary social skills if they are not pushed, In school learning allows for that push to occur. Attending online classes limits ones exposure to society. It allows for one to surrond themesleves in their own bubble, a bubble that they are not willing to leave. One has to face adversities within their enviorment to thrive later on, in school learning allows for that.

Online classes allow for a lack of personal interaction between students and teachers. One can not explain their thoughts via email or facetime, students need that face to face interaction to express their thoughts and concerns. Attending classes online leads to zero feedback from the teacher and the student. Schooling is extreamly surface level with this type of learning. An assigment is assigned and completed, their is no disscusion or questions, when one is in an in school enviorment he/she is pushed to ask about the assigmnet. Mearley posting ""any question or conerns please email me"" does not motivate a student to learn but insted motivates a student to get a good grade. As stated previously online schooling is extreamly shallow, its not about the learning its about the grades one will recive. This type of method of learning leads to failure in the encoding process, one does not properly retain the information but instead has a slight idea of it. Attending classes online leads to a lack of in dept schooling.

In conclusion, i do not belive students would benefit from attending classes online. Online schooling devlops bad habbits in ones psychology and creates a false narritive that the easist solution is the best solution. Attending classes from home will eventually lead to one gaining numerous health problems both mentally, physically and socialiy. Online schooling is an example of societies attempt to confrom the mases towards a technology drivien enviroment. One should stay clear of this and constanly work hard and achive the best education they can get. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
E40FCCD0202A,"Should distant learning be offered for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? Yes, because this option would benefit students who can't/ aren't allowed to leave their homes by engaging them in the same material someone would learn in a physical classroom. Distance learning could also benefit people in more rural or remote areas who don't have access to a proper classroom education. On the other hand, students could take advantage of online classes in a negative way. Distractions like video games, hanging out with friends, and sleeping in are some ways online learning can be taken advantage of, and that student is not getting a proper education nor benefiting from online learning.

Distance learning can benefit people everywhere and give people a proper education without leaving their home. The people looking into distant learning are people who can't leave their home, people in remote areas, and students who just don't want to go to a physical school. Students on house arrest or incarcerated could get an education without posing a threat to themselves or others. Also, educating people that are in prison could greatly help them when they finish their sentence. Having a high school or college degree would allow them to get a job, stay on the right path, and not end up back in jail. Students with a disability who cannot leave their home can benefit in the same way and receive a proper education without leaving the comfort of their home. Lastly, people in remote or rural areas who don't have access to a physical school building could also get an education they would not have gotten without distant learning.

On the other hand, students could take advantage of online classes in a negative way. Distractions pose to be the biggest issue because it prevents students from getting the full learning experience by taking their focus away from the material. Electronics are the biggest issue, because everyone in today's world has a smart phone or laptop, and they are always glued to it. When you are at home there won't be a teacher there to tell you to get off your phone or take it away, and a lack of authority will make it easy to lose focus and not pay attention to the material. lastly, not having to wake up every morning to take the bus or drive to school will allow you to sleep in, this will most likely promote laziness and destroy your work ethic.

In conclusion, distance learning will benefit people who can't leave their home, in jail, use it properly, be attentive, and have self discipline by staying away from distractions. But for people that want to take advantage of online learnign in a negative way can do it at the cost of their own education. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B8E586DF8C64,"For years and years, the act of receiving an education has been offered to students through attending school. Recently, there has been a new trend called ""distance learning."" This type of education allows a student to obtain an education by way of online classes and video conferencing. Many do not support distance learning due to believing a student's social time will be limited. However, distance learning would benefit a student by allowing them to learn in a comfortable environment such as their room, encouraging more sleep by allowing them to pick their own school hours, and providing a healthy alternative to education when it comes to being sick or illnesses.

To begin with, often times the most dreaded parts of a student's school day are the huge crowds, slow-paced hallways, and loud noises. Students who suffer with anxiety or those who are always on edge can be intimidated by these factors. These minor infractions could potentially prevent the proper education for a student by either being a distraction or placing them in a situation they are not comfortable with. If school systems were to implement distance learning, students would be able to attend class from the comfort of their own bed or relaxing spot within their own home. Students who feel comfortable in their working environment are more likely to care and maintain the work they are required to participate in. For example, a student who has a fear of public speaking and presenting in front of a class may skip out on a presentation assignment in order to avoid an awkward speaking encounter. Although, with distance learning, the student instead could present their project through video conference with their teacher and receive the same grade as if they were physically in class. All in all, distance leaning benefits students by placing them in more comfortable school related situations.

Continuing on, sleep should be a key factor in every person's life. However, adequate sleep is what many students struggle with due to juggling excessive homework with after school activities and family time. For example, an involved student is given a strict daily schedule which often includes going to school from 8:30am-3:30pm and then attending a two hour event afterwards for a club or sport. By the time the student arrives home and finishes their homework, it can be extremely late into the evening allowing for minimal sleep. On the contrary, students involved with distance learning are granted permission to choose which hours they clock in and do their online work required for a class. Whether this means sleeping in and working throughout the afternoon, or waking up early in order to get to bed at a decent time that night, distance learning provides more flexible hours for students to complete their daily school assignments. Overall, responsible students who take advantage of the more relaxed school day hours through online school and distance learning should experience a benefit within their sleep schedule and habits.

Lastly, the number one priority of a school is to provide a safe learning environment for students attending. However, when the flu season or something similar comes around, schools can sometimes be some of the most dangerous places to attend. With massive amounts of students and germs, catching a cold or getting sick can often be inevitable. By participating in distance learning during a flu or cold outbreak, a student can acquire their daily information without the risk of getting sick from their peers. Distance learning also benefits students on the other end of the scale as well. For example, many students attend school while they are still ill in order to not miss tons of work. Even though these students have good intentions, they are essentially putting others in harms way by spreading their germs around the school. The sick student could instead stay home from school and make sure they do not miss any work by participating in distance learning. The student could have a personal conversation by video conferencing with their teacher and ask what they need to do in order to stay caught up and then have that work completed by the time they are healthy and ready to attend school again. In the end, distance learning benefits students by ensuring a healthy school environment and allowing students who are temporarily sick to keep up with their work all while in the comfort and care of their own home.

In conclusion, distance learning benefits students by allowing them to learn in a comfortable environment such as their room, encouraging more sleep by allowing them to pick their own school hours, and providing a healthy alternative to education when it comes to sickness. Students who participate in online school will experience higher grades due to distance learning being accommodating to every aspect of a student's life. Distance learning should be implemented in more schools throughout the world because it has many benefits that can help all different types of students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
56AC4BE71C2F,"If weather or not students should or should not attend class from home by online video conferencing . I think in my opinion students should do that and work from home , for example if one day you are feeling sick but you want to attend school and get all your work done that will be one method . Another example will be if you are out of town and you still need to get work your done , the perfect way will be doing it online. Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it will be better I will get my work done , wouldnt be distracting at all and feel much conformable in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school. I honestly feel much better doing work at home then being school, if you need help or anything just email the teacher. Another example will be getting to do all the work from doing it in bed but yet still doing your work from home should be an option or be required . In conclusion I say that students should be attending classes from home and it should be an option so they could still get there class work done.                                                                      ",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2
40FB5A8DB596,"Online learning should be an option for students mainly for seniors . Why i say this because seniors are the most busy in high school , they are all working hard in and out of school to earn money to go to college . And sometimes most students can't handle the pressure of their final year in high school because they have to balance out their personal life , school, also work at the same time . Another reason is that half of the students in high school work right after school and get out around 10;00pm or later depends where you are working , So students barely have time to do homework because they are getting out of work late . And right when they get home from work they go straight to their rooms and start doing their homework for class tomorrow . But if we had online classes it would be much easier for students and release a lot of stress because students won't have to worry so much about turning in their homework in on time . With the online classes there should a deadline where you have to turn in your homework on a certain date ,Therefore the students won't have to worry about it so much because they know the deadline when they have to turn in their homework and it gives the students more time to relax and take a little break from school.

Another reason why i think it's a good idea and i'm speaking from my experience for the three years that i've been in high school , it doesn't get any easier it gets harder and harder every year . junior and senior year are the most hardest years in high school ,right now I'm in 11th grade and i have like i have a lot of stress on me because teachers giving us test and quiz's back to back and we have two extra sol's that we have take this year. Which adds even more stress on us because i always think negative and always think the worse knowing that i could do really good on my test and sols or do really bad and fail every quiz and test that my teachers give me . Failing a grade or a class is a students biggest fear because they don't want to repeat that class or stay another year in school .This is why students always push themselves to the max and try the best they can to be the most success in high school and make their parents proud .

I always try my best in school i give it all i got , because i dont want to let my parents down and fail them . Next year will be my final year in high school and i have a full schedule for my senior year and i hate it because i wanted to be able to go to work early and make as much money as possible before i leave for college . That's why i wished school's would offer online classes because one you could finish the class in a couple months and get thr credit for the class .And second it will free your schedule and give you the chance to leave school early . Also if a student is missing a credit they don't have and they need it to graduate on time , the school should offer them that class that they take it online so they won't be missing any credits and graduate on time with their class .

Therefore i think online classes is a good idea for many reasons and i think school's should offer it to students and let them pick if they want to do online classes or attend their classes at school . And even if some students are missing any credits or failed a grade school's should give students the chance to make it up . No student wants to do five years in high school when they could finish in four , this is why i think online classes is a good idea because it will benefit a student who failed a class or even failed a grade a year before because with the online classes they could finish the classes they need and attend school at the same time just do the online classes out of school . I think online classes would benefit me a lot because i'm missing one or two credits right now and i would have to go to summer school to get those credits , But nobody wants to be at school in the summer time they rather be outside and having fun . So if my school offed me the chance to take online classes i would so i could graduate on time and with my class . so that my parents see me walk that stage and know that i made it and will do big plans after high school . Therefore yes i think online classes is a good idea and will benefit a lot of high school student's.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
22291845AEDC,"Imagine being able to attend classes in the comfort of your own home. In fact, many individuals believe in the the benefits of a student being able to attend classes from home. While it seems like a great idea for the students it's a downfall to their ability to learn and grow as an individual. Being able to attend classes from home would open the door for the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development of the individual.

One reason that attending classes from a place other than school is a bad idea is because it opens up the opportunity to be able to cheat. When at home who is there to be able to stop the student? Many individuals will find themselves intrigued with the idea of passing all their classes because they have all of the resources right there in front of them. When doing classes at home there is no way to monitor the way that students learn the information or if they are even learning it at all. The ability to cheat skyrockets as soon as the option of distance learning is introduced. Having the benefit of being at home gives students the time to come up with answers that they might not know. Every student will look for an easy A and having the opportunity to take the classes from home makes the possibilities endless for that so called ""prefect grade"".

In addition to cheating there is the aspect of distractions all around the individual. Many will say that their home is where they feel most comfortable. So in that case it goes to show that having the ability to learn at home, individuals will be faced with many challenging distractions. Being at home is like an invitation to a candy shop, so many options but what to choose? Will the individuals do their work or will they decide to mess with their siblings, play with their dogs, make food, call a friend, go out, or do their work? With school work being the students number one priority, there will come many challenging decisions, but if they didnt have the ability to attend the classes from home then the distractions would decrease tremendously. Students already tend to struggle in the classroom environment so adding in the possible comfort of their home is really asking them to do the impossible. They wont be able to focus on school work or have the access to the tools that will make them most successful.

Lastly, when attending classes at home an individuals social development can be slower. Having the ability to interact with others on a daily basis is very important to the growth of ones social abilities. When working from home students have the ability to isolate themselves from others which slows their development down. Going to school allows individuals to interact with teachers and peers which helps them to develop who they are as a person. If an individual just sits at home all day and isolates them self then they won't develop their own character because it's as if they are just living in a bubble. When at home by themselves the students also don't get the communication skills needed to succeed in social development.

While on the other hand, some will say that in the comfort of their own home they will do better and have a greater chance of success. They believe that they can focus more in an environment where they are most comfortable. Individuals feel as if there is less pressure on them because they dont always have that figure standing over them as they would if they were in the classroom. While in reality ones home is too comfortable and you need the constant nagging to be able to get done what needs to get done.

So in conclusion being at school and involved with the contact of everyday people is the best choice for an individual to succeed. Attending classes from home would only open up the possibilities of cheating, distractions, and slower social development. So now the questions yours, does it benefit the student to work from home with many downfalls?",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
B63EAF46C812,"Attending class from home would benefit students by keeping them away from sicknesses, bad weather, and saving money. Online or video conferencing would be offered to students to still get the education they need. With this education from home students will still get the same information as the other students.

Having class at home helps other students to not catch stomach bugs, colds, and viruses.

A school is where many germs are stored. Some parents send their children to school sick because they don't like their child to be absent. After the student attends school the sickness spreads through the school. Students should have the option to take classes at home especially during the winter to prevent getting sick.

Another reason to have class at home would keep students out of bad weather. If it snows some students live in the woods and the road conditions are different than the students who live in a town. Other students live near rivers, lakes, and ponds and a bad rain storm could keep them locked inside their homes. If they could take classes from home, it would keep student drivers off of the road. Then students can be kept safe.

One more reason would be that fuel gets expensive. School buses need fuel to run their routes, so that students can learn. Students getting their education at home saves money for the school. The money could be spent to pay the teachers for video conferencing and other online learning programs. Students would also benefit by less money going into their car to go to school.

Students attending class from home can still get the same education as the other students.

Students can get well, stay safe, and save gas on their adventure of online learning. Online classes and video conferences will come in handy to students. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
41B2F4B0B8EB,"The world we inhabit is unpredictable and chaotic in nature as nothing is truly considered absolute. To further elaborate, our education system does not incorporate nor place these various components of unpredictability into consideration in regards to education. One such possible method to incorporate the inconsistent characteristics of life into a student's education would be by the offering of distance learning, as a viable alternative to a traditional education. This feat would be achieved via utilization of online chat rooms working in synchronization with video conferences. Some may argue or disagree with this notion, but to do so would be arrogant. A significant portion of students would benefit by attending classes from home because it is efficient and offers a plethora of opportunities and alternatives.

Utilizing distance learning education could be considered much more efficient as this particular method promotes the elimination of wasting time. For instance, the society that we reside within is obsessed with the various concepts of time. Every task must be achieved within a certain restriction of time, or it is to be considered flawed. This mentality itself of ""punctuality"" is flawed as time itself is relative. But by eliminating the requirement of various tasks that needlessly waste time, such as transportation or preparation, a student is capable of achieving much greater feats.

Distance learning could potentially provide a plethora of students with a secure alternative location for their education. For example, the recent number of increasing confirmed reports of the corona virus within the United States has caused a widespread panic amongst the public. This specific and unpredictable strain of virus spreads rapidly through physical contact. But by eliminating the need to travel to a designated location and mingling with large crowds, the pandemic would barely impact the education of an individual. Furthermore, other threats such as mass shootings within schools would dwindle significantly in numbers due to the lack of students physically present.

Some may argue that students would not benefit from participating in classes from home because this method is drastically different from what is to be considered a proper education, but this is not the case. There are still various assignments and assessments to be completed in an efficient manner. Distance learning is just simply another method of surmounting the endeavor of obtaining an education but from the comforts of one's home. As this specific method promotes efficiency in addition to providing ample opportunities and alternatives for individuals striving for success.

Distance learning is a definitively viable alternative to a traditional education that incorporates and accommodates for the unpredictable and chaotic characteristics of life.                ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
80D1357B10A0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. While some people benefit from staying home, others may prefer the school atmosphere. Either way, it's mostly about personal preference and if it helps in the long run. There shouldn't be a reason to be forced to do one thing or another so having a choice is good. Therefore, students would benefit from taking classes at home because it runs through their schedule and it makes task a little easier.

One thing that is a problem for students nowadays are their schedules. Students have other task other than schools like having a job. Students the older they get, start applying to get hired so they can have money for personal reasons. Sometimes, they might get unreasonable hours and since they have school, it could possibly backfire. A lot of teens may work up to late at night which takes a toll on their sleep and school work. It could even be a point that the student can't do any school work at all and might fall behind. However, if that student took classes online, its a possibility their jobs wont get in the way of their studies. If they could organize the schedule that could benefit his school work and job at the same time, it would help in a big way. Also they can have enough rest since the student doesn't have to wake up at dawn. Their is so much benefits to take online classes.

Another example could be taking care of siblings. Lets just say their mom has to work late so that student has to take care of their bother and sister. The student can't be at school and at home at the same time. There would be no way around that its one or the other. Because there would be nobody who can take care of the kids. Some people could say to just drop them off at a daycare but some people might not have that type of money to spend. Others might say that they could hire a babysitter but that might not work either. In this situation, school seems to be affecting him in a huge way. If he managed his schedule accordingly, he'll have time to take care of the kids and focus on school at home at the same time. Which would mean less stress in total because he'll have time for both kids and schoolwork.

There's people who have different ideas about this topic. They believe that students who take online classes would not benefit at all because the student isn't getting that ""hands on learning experience"". However, thats not the case with this topic. Some students don't have to learn hands on. There's different types of students in the world that prefer other ways of learning. Since the critics probably learned it that way, they believe everybody else should learn it too and its completely wrong. Thats not how students should benefit. Its all about what makes them comfortable to the point that they can do their work as smooth and as quickly as possible without any problem or confusion.

In conclusion, students who feel like the school environment isn't for them, should just take online classes. There should be no reason to put that much stress on a student when they have daily lives like other people. There's more to life than just school and people don't understand that. The toll it can take on somebody is ridiculous. It's already hard enough in school and plus doing other task outside of class is very stressful. Even though students have a choice to take online classes, it's not talked about often. In total, the ratio of kids going to school except for staying home is huge. Its honestly not that common. However, if its anyway it could be discussed with the school board, it might affect how students are today in general. With all the time the students have on their hands, it's would be way more manageable then ever before. Some people in this world are would probably never understand that issue. They need to do an experiment on which students are more successful. With the results of that experiment, they could take what they got form the experiment and change how students are in the future.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

But some downsides are you are less social because you don't attend classes with anyone else it's just you and a computer. You don't get to experience some things like pep rallies,dances,or sport events. Those moments is what makes high school memorable. You aren't able to participate in extracurricular activities with friends after school. Which is where lots of people make most of their friends because they share similar interest. Also it would be a little harder for you to get help on work rather than if you were in a classroom with a teacher face to face because you can stay after with the teacher for extra help if needed. It's a lot less hands on and you dont get to do many group activities. Most students learn better when things are more hands on and interactive.

You will be able to do school on your own time and not wake up so early. You can wake at 12 and begin your school day rather than waking up early to go to school. You will be able to take notes on your own time getting all the information you need rather than feeling rushed to get it all down. You can complete worksheets and homework on your time although there is still a deadline. You can sleep in and get all the hours you need so that you'll be energized and ready to do your work. If you were to attend a regular school you would be less energized and would slack off more in class because you don't have the sleep you need. Teenagers are suppose to get at least 8-10 hours of sleep we could do this by taking online classes and getting all those hours we need which would make us more successful with completing our work.

Another thing is that we would be more focused and have less distractions. We wouldn't have to worry about anyone else because it's just you and a computer. When you are around friends and other classmates you tend to get more distracted and want to talk which would could cause you to not complete your work. Some students cant concentrate in a loud environment like a classroom so working alone at home in the quiet could benefit them. But also some kids prefer to listen to music when doing work but some teachers don't allow phones and you wouldn't have to worry about that at home. This would also take care of some of the cheating problems that happen because there is no one for you to cheat off of. You could learn more things because it's just you so you're more focused on the actual lesson.

Also could teach you to be more responsible and have better time management. There is no one around to tell you 100 times that you have to turn in your homework on Wednesday or that you have a project due next month. You have to responsible enough to remember these things and get them done yourself and turn them in before the deadline. You have to be responsible enough to remember to log in everyday to take your classes and if you don't that's on you and nobody else. You also have to take time to do these projects and classwork because you can't do them in class,so you have to manage your time correctly to get them done.

Finally,this would help some of the bullying issues and drama at schools. You don't have to worry about anybody else because youre not with anyone else. A lot of the drama that occurs,starts at school and then goes to social media or vice versa starts on social media and then transfers to school which leads to fights. Also bullying is a really big issue that occurs among teenagers especially in high school which leads to people taking their lives. But if you are taking classes online and don't attend school then you can avoid some of that conflict with students because you don't have to see anyone.

So therefore,attending school online could make you more responsible and give you better time mangement. You can get your hours of sleep you need because you don't have to wake up as early. You have a little more freedom because you aren't on a set schedule it's on your own time. There will be less conflict and drama among students which makes it a lot safer. You will be more succssesful because you dont have a lot of distractions around you. So having school online will benefit you both positively and negatively in many ways.       ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
831F54B2B19D,"Would like to be in your bed during the school day? Well some schools make that possible for kids, by letting them take their classes from their houses. Personally, I think that would be a great thing; but for somebody who has a tough time pay attention at school, I am sure that I would not be able to focus at home. I know that many kids are like me in that sense, kids shouldn't be able to go to school at home. The reasons why people shouldn't be going to school at home is because, they would get distracted very often, people would be anti-social, kids might be to comfortable, and that their is a high chance that kids would forget their work a great deal of the time.

Kids in my generation seem to have a great deal of attention problems, so I find it very likely that many kids would have a extremely hard time keeping on task while going to school at home. Many kids at my school have ADD or ADHD which affects their ability to focus, and that causes them to be disruptive and of task during the school day. So for those kids having to take classes at home would lead to them having worse grades. Also around 3 quarters of the people in my school seem to have a pet of some kind, and that would make it very hard to concentrate, especially if the pet likes to be around people at all times.

Another big reason for why kids shouldn't take classes at home is that it makes them be anti-social, because kids spend around 7 hours a day at school, which is where they get most of their social interaction. If people aren't going to school it is going to be very hard for people to make friends and be social. For example, I know somebody who goes to a very small private school that has around 60 kids in it (and around 6 in his grade), which limits their social activity their and they have a really hard time making friends where he lives.

A large reason for not taking classes at home, is that it might be a little to comfortable. People being comfortable is not a bad thing but in can be, people siting on their couch might not be a bad thing for one or two class periods, but if they are siting there 7 hours a day uninterrupted would be a very bad thing. Schools make kids walk between classes instead of teachers because of teachers need to keep all their stuff set up like in a Chem classroom, or they make kids move around to regain focus and get their blood flowing around their bodies again. Schools also get hard plastic chairs for kids to sit in so that they will stay awake, because the chairs are uncomfortable, and can be very cold.

Kids also would forget about work if they took classes online. Teachers in schools give out paper copies of homework or notes which many kids find to be very helpful with not forgetting about the homework or helpful studying, because they have the paper with them. But if people where going to class online they would have to go and print out a worksheet or take their notes online which would be hard for many people. For example, if one of the kids from my school with ADD/ADHD was to forget to print out a homework assignment or print out notes they took online, they would have a very hard time studying on the computer without going on to another website that is not for school.

Their are some positive things about taking online classes. Like people dont have to leave their house if they need to take care of somebody, like a grandparent. People also have the ability to be comfortable, which isn't a bad thing if it is in little sections and the person gets up and moves. There would also be no/minimal snow days or sick days, which many people would think would be a bad thing but your school year would end earlier.

Even with all of the positives to taking online classes, the negatives still out way them. So people shouldn't be taking online classes, for the reasons that kids would have to many distractions, would anti-social, they would be to comfortable, and they would forget work to often.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
201EC18E0A04,"Have you ever wondered or wanted to take your school classes at home. Well I feel students would benefit from taking classes at home because its more comfortable for students and its less stress on a student.

A way students will benefit from taking their classes at home is it will be more comfortable for them. For example, a reason why so many kids do not like going to school is getting up early and sitting in plastic chairs for most of the day, but if the students were at home they would not have to worry about sitting in plastic chairs or getting up early and they would feel more relief when they are learning. This shows that students will benefit off taking classes at home by being able to relax to give them a better work ethic.

Another way students will benefit from taking their classes at home is it will be less stress on the students. For example, turning in assignmetns late is a big issue most students have but when this is done electronically over a computer work is easy to obtain and turn in because the students will not have to keep up with all paper printed assignents when it is on computer for them. This show that kids will benefit off taking classes by the students being more focus on task and responsible for the assignments they turn in through computer at home.

Some people think that students are better off taking classes from school. However, those people are wrong because most students in general do not like school. Unlike school, students will benefit from taking classes at home because all they have to worry about is finishing the work which is why students would like home school better. For example, students will be more determined if they can get the assignments done and move on to something they wanted to do and them not having to worry about a teacher telling them get off the phone the idea is to get the students to want to learn.

Its more comforable and less stressful for students to take classes from home. These are the benfits from taking classes from home. Principal please consider these ideas for the students and maybe make a change. Thank you.          ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5EB7A0B134B4,"some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due.

First, they can get distracted, In my position

I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game.

Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all

I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything

I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due.

Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience.

In solution, people can do what is best for you if you like do school by home because you do not like people or have personal problem or have i disability that you go it no one is going to say anything. But some time people want to have friends have fun because you are a person the like to be around people that good to. the only thing i am saying chose what is best for you not what is best for other people or what other people think. Make you own decision be proud of you no matter what.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Working on school work from home can have an impact of your learning. Most people are sometimes better at being hands on learning or they learn from notes and more better ways. if somethings there trying to benifit from home some people do online school and you mite think they can cheat on there work and do sneaky things. For one reason i would say is that if your in a class you have a better chance at hearing the teacher and know what they are doing and if your online you would use videos and online documents.

body paragraph 1 if i was a student at my school and my school offer me to take a online class i would say no because i like to be hands on and take notes with the teachers and understand what's going on in the class room. Haveing a class online it my feel weird because you are alone and its is just youreslf with no help and i think that can have a negative effect on my if i was chosen to take a online class. Sometimes people tend to be angry because and do not have no help in the classroom and want to do things on there own and want to do things there own way.

body paragraph 2 students would not benefit from takeing classes from home and for me i think that because that person my not have ever taken a online class.

now since there onlinethey would have to learn a diffrent way of learning all becuase they are takeing a class online insted of takeing the regular class where you can be active with the teacher. One of my reason i say this is becuase they would have no help online and they would just cheat there way into a good grade and you are not getting anything from that and that would be a bad part of learning.

Teachers may use online resources for there students and that's is okay but people got to understand that the internet and messy and it can mess up alot of things in many types of ways in learning.

body paragraph 3

The class room have a big impact on learning and if you do not pay attention you would no be able to know the stuff that you are in class. Teachers try their best to use as my types of ways for you to learn in the class room online you may cheat and find all diffrent types of ways for you to pass but not learn anything. Students can benefit from cheating. if is waas in the position of a student and takeing an online class i would not be able to learn because i have no help and all and i would not understand that things i would be doing online. an online confrance can help if i do not get off track at anytime in the video and pay attention alot but it still would be hands on for me even if i can see and hear my teacher.

body paragraph 4 for all things in takeing an online class first people will need computer and some people do not have enough money for a computer or internet access at the home. well if you was at school you would just need to attend the class and leanring and get an education. if your takeing an online class and home a person just mite go in the kitchen and get a bunch of food and get off track from there work and will end up getting a bad grade on something. Just becuse it an online class doesn't mean that your can use the internet for all the anwser i serch up college teachers and some teachers said that the students they have online they will check every single person work.

counter argument people that use online classes as another way of leanring it is going to be a bad thing to be because you not in a regular class and your not learning the right wat you suppose to. if you take an conference video it mite can help people understand the concept of the work. The most extreme reason i will say is that most students wouldnt have the funds for a computer to take an online class. online and a reugular class will change everything and if i was in the position i would take a reugular class so i can be in the moment and learn better and get help from my teacher conclusuion in conclusion student cannot benefit from being able to take a class from home just because if may effect them and a very big way. Students may not have the right funds for it and some my get off topic and get away from the learning and get a bad grade on ther work online. in regular class you can be hands and and takes notes and learn and let the teachher guide you to succes all you have to do is pay attention and do your work. if a person have taken a online class it still wouldnt fit the right way then a reuglar school class.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
38B7875D420E,"Technology has a greater, more widespread impact on various facets of daily life than ever before. New technological developments now aid in routine, everyday tasks such as mail delivery, shopping, and even vacuuming the floor. One extremely common routine that technology is aiding in secondary schooling. In fact, many public and private schools at all levels are beginning to offer distance learning, or non-classroom settings such as virtual classes and video conferences that cover the same curriculum that a traditional classroom would. Students would benefit from from distance learning through online classrooms or video conferencing because these methods of learning offer remedies to personal issues that stem from classroom learning, provide an easier alternative for those who may have difficulty getting to school, and it can allow students to work at their own pace instead of the pace dictated by a classroom setting.

A benefit of schooling through distance learning can be seen in those with personal issues that stem from or are triggered by a traditional classroom. For example, many students have challenges such as social anxiety, ADD, or Asperger's which can be affected by large crowds or groups of people, aspects that a standard classroom offers. These large gatherings may make those affected very anxious or nervous, unable to focus, or susceptible to emotional or verbal outbursts. By moving the classroom to the home via distance learning, many of these problems brought on by large gatherings are eliminated because the student is now in the comfort of their own home, family, and possibly a couple other students, yet they are still obtaining the same education and life skills that a classroom would offer. In fact, they may even learn quicker and more successfully because of the elimination of these problems. These people with social disabilities would benefit from distance learning because it would resolve problems that occur at school which possibly hinder their learning.

Another benefit that distance learning has over traditional classroom settings is the elimination of difficulties stemmed from getting to and from schools that may affect the students' education or daily lives. This benefit can be seen in rural areas of the country where the commute to school in the nearest city may be as much as fifty miles, with the added time of bus stops for every student who lives along the way. In these cases, the school day may only be seven hours, but a commute of up to ninety minutes in each direction can make school a time commitment of as much as ten hours every day, not to mention extracurricular activities that can take up even more time.

This is a serious burden on the daily lives of the students, especially with the need to complete homework and even just relax. Additionally, in some places, such as the Mid-Atlantic, one snowstorm of twenty inches or so can close schools for a week or more due to the lack of equipment to handle those occasional storms. This lost time can limit and hinder students' education simply because they are unable to get to school. Distance learning, so long as power is on, can heavily limit or even eliminate the impacts of such weather events or long commutes by taking away the commuting aspect of school so that the students can stick to the ideal schedule to maximize their education. Distance learning benefits these groups of people by providing an efficient and routine schedule that students can maximize their education on.

A third positive outcome of distance learning is the allowance for students taking part in these programs to work at their own pace. With traditional schooling methods, students are placed in classes of as many as thirty peers all trying to obtain the same education and lesson within the time constraints of the class. As with any large group of adolescents, some students will quickly catch on, while some will take longer to grasp the material. However, when one teacher is controlling a classroom of thirty different learning paces, they have to attempt to find a happy medium to teach the curriculum, and they are additionally limited to the constraint of a 45- to ninety-minute class period. This leaves the quicker students bored and unsatisfied while the slower students are left to struggle to continue to catch up to the teacher's pace. This issue is especially prevalent in an AP or college level class, where there is a lot of material thrown at the students at once. With distance learning, however, students have the benefit of learning at their own pace. Because of the eternal availability of the internet and email as well as abundant resources both in virtual classrooms and on the web, students are able to quickly tackle the subjects that come easy to them while also able to slow down, ask questions, and get additional help on topics that they struggle on. By not having to conform to a teacher's pace, students are more likely to succeed at their own pace, which is encouraged through distance learning.

Traditional classroom learning may be what nearly everyone in the country is used to, but what may come easy or familiar to one person may not always be easy to another person. A good alternative to many of the problems brought about by a standard classroom setting is the development of distance learning based on new technology,

Among the benefits it has are provision of a more comfortable environment for students with learning or other disabilities, elimination of problems brought on by long or challenging commutes to school, and the ability for students to learn at their own pace to maximize their understanding of the material, all while learning the same subjects they would learn in a classroom All in all, while classroom learning has proven to be effective in years past, there are many additional benefits of distance learning, and because of this, it can be expected to expand further in the coming years.       ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
D9CB3A1C5A65,"Doing school work from home can extremely help out a student or individual with their needs and problems. A few ways this could help is: It an help with reducing stress built up within a Student, With this come the safety of the students home, such as a protection from virus and school shootings such as: COVID-19, and other viruses. Another really good reason is, Bullying in schools have been a serious problem for decades, and working from home can solve that problem!

One reason that working from home is good is that It can relieve stress from an individual, and or minor under the age of 18. Throughout high school and college teens and adults are very stressed, as they are forced to get a job, live a life, but also go to class every single day. Most teen's and adult's schedules are packed up from 8 AM to around 8 PM. With online classes or video calling, it can extremely help out the students who's schedules are very packed.

A second reason is, the safety of your own home is a vital asset to some. Schools and campuses are safe most of the time, but there comes a moment to where guns start to fire, and/or a virus spreads rampant thought out the city or town. True safety can be obtained by staying at home, where you are not at any risk of viruses, or school shooters. By staying at home, the student, can get his work done, in safe place, that allows him to relax, and be calm, unlike in a classroom where you have to be on alert most of the time.

The last, but not least: Bullying. Bullying has been a huge problem increase for students in the last decade. Bullying has gone back a very long time, but the last decade has seen ""The Peak"" of Bullying this decade. This can also tie into safety, as some bullies like to physically abuse their clients. Staying at home can help limit bullying or help bully victims get their work done without the anxiety or fear that they are going to be bullied. This can also help with people who want to stay away from bullies in a general perspective, or maybe they don't want to fall into the ""Bully gang"" or ""Club"".

Letting students work from home, can have many many other advantages, but there are disadvantages too. Mostly good things come from letting students work from home, and can improve health of an individual, or student. Along with this, it would be in best interest if students were allowed to choose to be at home, or come to school. Ether way, the student would be happy and not feel forced to do something they do not want to do.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
689A9ACF5486,"Have you ever wish to learn at home? or in your bed? Well with online or video conferences you can, but many people would think that is a bad idea. Would students benefit on the online classses? Yes they would and not only them; this will be also benefitial for others because it will be less tressfull, new objectives could come out of it, and more sleep. Taking online courses would benefit to everyone, but only if it's use correctly and responsible.

One of the reasons of why students should take online classes is because is less stress in their student's lifes. Stress can be dangerous to people and students. They are getting more stress in school for many reasons, waking up early, going on time to take the bus even in cold days, or if the student drive he has to check for trafic, taking classes with different teachers, and many more just in school high school; students are just teenagers that are starting high school. This is the most important steps in their lifes, and with the online classes they can leave those other worries and focus more on their studies, and this can be done with the online courses. They don't have to worry about going late to school, or waking up early they have the access they need in their computer.

Another reason why would be a good idea to take online classes is that new objectives can come out of it for example. Saving more the natural environment, the students would have to use less their cars or have to take public transportation; all of this liberates pollution which is a problem now in days. More jobs for the other teachers, with the only courses they need teachers if the students wants to have some kind of personal teacher to teach them, this can create more jobs for the teachers, and the teacher can also teach from their homes; this not only benefit the students it also benefit the teachers. This can be also open new ways of learning one example is, if the teahcer is sick, but would still want to work to make money to pay their debts. This can allow the interaction with the student without the worry of getting them sick. The more use of technology, as the new geration comes and new technologies are invented we have to get use them in every way possible, and start with the use of our technology that we have in hand like computer, cell phones and new technologies that can benefit all of us.

One of many reasons why would be a good idea to use online classes is that we would get more sleep. As simple it sound this is a problem in many schools were they have students sleeping in their classes. This is creating a problem between the students ,and the teachers were some situation the teachers are also tired from grading homeworks, or staying at school late for work or an event; however, with the online classes the students and the teachers can make a schedule in which they can agree with. Many people could said that is easy to solve such a problem, and will be for the students to sleep early or don't work so late, but either way this keep going and many students fall sleep at their classes especially in the first two. This is one of many reason why this will be a good idea for students to use online courses.

Why would be a good idea for students to use online classes? Well it be a good idea for students to use online programs that help them with their studies which can, release stress, new way of using the technology, and help more students to get them more sleep. This are great things to considerate; however, this also have their down sides like less work for bus drivers, less students going to work or more lazyness for students that don't get out of their rooms to do some exercise, bur either way not everything has only good or bad ideas just that we have to know how to use them.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
94872E0B0E4B,"Students who take classes online don't get the full education they want to get during school. Online classes show that students have to learn everything on their own, this affects students because they don't have access to a teacher that can guide them when the student it struggling. Having to take a class online may affect students social life because they have to sit in front of a screen all day. Taking classes online isn't beneficial because students don't get to fully understand the subject when they are forced to learn it themselves, students don't get to have as much of a social life because they do their work on a screen while others are in school throughout the day, although, others may argue that taking online classes are helpful for students.

Online classes can be a huge struggle for some students because, not all students can teach themselves a class they need a teacher to help them learn the subject more. The class online may be easier for some teachers to do, students don't get to learn as much as the kids in the classroom do. Online classes deprive students of getting the classroom feel. In the classroom students get to practice the subject they are learning about, while online students don't, they have to learn one thing and move on to the next, they aren't given anytime to process what they just learned and how they are able to use it in their daily lives. Students also don't get to use their creativity to give themselves a fun learning experience, for example, doing labs in science class, or having to do group projects, taking an online class takes the creative aspect away from students. Having an art class let students express how they feel and being able to show off what they are capable of. Taking an online school won't let you do that because, students won't be hands on with the projects, and they won't get the full experience if they just with a video of it online. Having to take an online class can also affect students social life, and missing out on after school activities.

When students have to take an online class, they tend to lose connections with people because, taking classes online keeps students inside their house, and when they want to go out and be with their friends, most are in school during the day. Not being able to interact with people, that don't live in your house, can affect a lot of students. This can affect a lot of students because, no one wants to stay stuck in a house all day, they want to go out and have fun with their friends, but when they are stuck inside doing school connections tend to get lost, Students interacting with people outside their own family helps them be a better person as they grow, it teaches them how to talk to certain people in certain settings, and it allows them to understand how other people work. Students also do not get to participate in extra curricular activities because they take school online. Being able to play a sport, or be apart of a club is a big part of the school experience, no student wants to miss out on that. Having clubs and sports expands the people students talk to and their social skills are broadened because of the amount of people they meet. Taking those extra curricular s show colleges that they are well rounded, and are capable of doing other things then just school work,However some may debate how taking online classes actually help students.

Others may say taking online classes is beneficial for students because they get to learn the subject at their own speed. In a classroom setting some teacher go through subjects extremely quickly which tends to hurt some students. The students don't get to fully learn the subject the way they want to, so taking school online will help that child immensely. When a student is ill, they tend to miss a lot of school so having the luxury of taking online school can help those kids in the long run. Online classes can help students figure out what they want to do with their life, because kids that have to go to school 8 hours a day don't get to think about what they want to pursue, or where they want to go. While the kids taking the classes online get to know exactly what they are going to do because they took the unessacary classes online, and they don't have to go through that struggle of wasting their time.

Students who take online classes aren't able to get the full classroom experience. They don't get to have someone guide them when they are struggling, they have to learn and understand the subject themselves. Online classes do not help students when they want to learn new things because it will just confuse them more and they will struggle to finish the class at a decent amount of time. Students not having the access to a teacher when they need it can cause the student to fail the class, or to not fully understand what the class is asking of them. Students don't get to have as much of a social life because other students are in school during the day, so they don't get to go out as much. Others may argue that being able to do classes online can help the students who are unable to attend school, but they still don't get to use their creativity when doing group projects and other fun school activities.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

First off, taking classes from Home provides the framework, for students to find self-motivation for college. Finding self-motivation, is a vital trait you need as a Adult for the real world. No one is going to spoon feed you, or hold your hand as you complete tasks. As you may discover, College Students often have to work for themselves in terms of completing assignments, taking notes, and studying. It's up to you not to get distracted, and to stay on task. It's your decision not to scroll through social media, or binge watch your favorite tv show. College students are forced to internally search and self-advocate within the margins of motivation, and time mangement to complete their work.

Your Professor in College will not force you to complete, what they assign you. on the contrary to School, Your Teacher will spoon feed you, and hold your hand through everything.

While the Student attends class from home, they are expected to stay on task and stray away from distractions, setting up a great practice for self-motivation not only for College, but also the Real World.

Additionally, Students have to freedom to learn accustomed to their learning style. Often through auditory, visual, and hands on learning. Schools provide a restricting enviroment that may not accomadate to every Student's learning style. As they are forced to follow one way; the Teachers'. Which is where You are forced to listen to their lecture and take notes, and shove all of the material down your throat, rather than chewing the material at a steady pace. At home, I am able to pace myself, and accomadate to my learning style and study the assigned material to what is individually best for me; the student.

However, not all may argee with letting their Students attend School from Home and They have their reasons.

Students need to be present in the School enviroment in order to get things done, and focus. Without the pressure of school, teachers, and grades its easy to fall behind with many distractions at home. As it's harder for the student to avoid distractions.

At home, It's a struggle to accomplish schoolwork and easy to get distracted with watching TV, or taking a nap. Additionally, at School if you need help your teacher is right there to guide you. You don't have to worry about your slow internet connection to contact your online Teacher ;thousands of miles away from you with a busy schudule in their hands. At school, You raise your hand, and your Teacher comes to your rescue and is able to clear up any concerns the you may have. Real life learning in the classroom provides an clear, direct way for the student to contact the teacher for any concerns, rather than the online teacher with the filled schudule, who wouldn't even receive your question days or weeks later.

In conclusion, I think students should be able to attend classes from home, in order to accomdate for their learning style. But also, having the freedom to work at their own pace, without the pressure of the school walls. Or having to worry, about teachers throwing information down the student's throat, and choking. Instead, students are able to self-pace according to themselves, and chew the information in considerable bites. Adolescents are able to self-advocate for them-selves as they move into the real world to become proactive adults. As school systems are moving towards better education for their students, we should take into consideration that every individual child works differently from one another. Working at home maybe adjusts better for them, then the restricting enviroment school entails.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4176E05183E0,"What are the benefit for the students from being able to attend class from home ?

I believe student will get more offers online,therefor, benefits online offers are, students will have less stress and more help form teachers,more focus on there work also less distraction. I also would say that online has everyone going on about also kids in school have used phones so maybe it is time to move on to something new.

My first reason is that some kids who are slow learns in a class with a lot of students in there class , are kids who will have more trouble in class . Slow learning kids get easily distraction by anything in class also more like not to finish there work and instant of doing there work they will talk to there peers . Also there are other problems like, there are many kids that would need a teachers help but she can only help one kid at a time. Therefor, some of the kids don't get the help they need. Also some the kids who are trying to do there work would be disturb by the noise in the classroom which will cause the student to get frosted.

Take a kid for example, in school things are going great for her and she has friends and she doing good in school , then out of know where her grads drop and she lost her friends and now she doesn't want to do anything anymore and she stops trying also this cause her to hate school because of problems in school . This is the other reason .

My third reason is the online videos. The online videos can help students finish the work they didn't had time for,students will have less difficult on there classwork they will have more time understanding form the videos that help them. Student that are in class will have more trouble cashing up with the class because teachers would like to move up to the next topic. this the reason kids in class are be hide and have no time to finish.

my least reason ,I believe that some the kids skip school because they find school not import and the reason they feel that way because there going through stuff at school and they don't want to be there when bad times come and kids find school unsafe and things could happen in school and nobody would know about it. So stay home and doing work online is a better idea.

These are all the reason kids should take online class at home , this gives you safety and this can help in your needs and to keep you up with others in class also teachers can help you more likewise this gives you more time . This also will keep you out of problems. so attending online class are good benefit.                                ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
924D8175D100,"Many adults are suspicious of students if they call in stick. This suspicion is not unfounded either, many high school students feign sickness to get out of tests or to escape an impending due date. But for some students, feigning an illness is not an option. For these high achieving students, being sick could mean a week of catching up on missed material, even if only one day of class is missed. Although some students may try to take advantage of a long distance learning system, it can greatly reduce the stress of missing class and keep students from falling behind.

Implementing a long distance learning approach would reduce the stress of missing class commonly felt by high achieving students. High school schedules can be so packed with classes, missing only one day can lead to a week or more of trying to catch up on tests, assignments, and notes. These students, to avoid missing class, often downplay illnesses that otherwise would have kept them at home. A long distance learning approach would allow students who are sick to stay at home while still learning, participating in class, and getting any important dates or other information that may have been mentioned in the class. This will reduce the time the student must spend catching up and encourage the student to stay at home when they are sick. This, in turn, will keep diseases like the flu from spreading rapidly through the school system as fewer students come to class sick. If the lessons are recorded, a student missing school for an event can catch up on classes at times teachers are usually unavailable. Many students choose not to attend academic competitions, extracurricular activities, and other important events during the school day because of the fear of missing class. Recording lectures encourages these students to pursue academic enrichment outside of the classroom as they do not have to worry as much about catching up on classes. They can play back these recordings during times when teachers are not commonly available which decreases the time it takes students to catch up on missed work, thus reducing the stress of missing class.

Adding a long distance learning system to the classroom would also prevent chronically ill students who cannot attend classes regularly from falling behind. Many students with illnesses such as Lyme disease are forced to skip class due to their illness. If too many days are missed, the student can fall behind in class and many be forced to repeat a class or an entire year. This causes an unneeded burden on the student, the family, and the school system. The aforesaid parties would greatly benefit from a remote learning system as the chronically ill student would be able to keep pace with the class from home. This reduces the probability that the student fails the class and is forced to repeat it. By making lectures available online, these students, and all students for that matter, would be given the chance to earn a higher grade as working outside of the class is more efficient. Students who want to study for an exam can go back through old lectures to ensure that they know all of the important information presented in class. This would result in higher grades, fewer failing students, and a better chance of success in college and later in life.

Implementing a remote learning system may encourage some students to skip class for no reason. On the surface, more students skipping class seems undesirable, but a remote learning system will allow these students, who may have skipped class anyway, to keep up with the class. Students who were absent from class could be required to check the video recording for the classes they missed which would ensure that all students know what happened in class. Even if more students skip class, implementing this system would ensure that all students know what happened in class whether they were present or not and will minimize the likelihood of a student falling behind.

High school can be a time of great stress on students. The level of performance mandated by some classes requires students spend more time and effort than ever before to maintain academic performance. Given that, it is important that all students are supported at this stage in their life. A bad or stressful experience in high school can discourage students from pursuing college or other challenging achievements. Implementing a long distance learning system at the high school level would give students the support they need to make the best of their high school experience and continue learning throughout their life.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
7203112033A1,"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.

1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!

2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldn't ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.

3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.

In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
2AD868FBE028,"Distance learning is a common type of learning for some schools across the country. Students are able too be at home and still learn the same subjects they learn at school. This type of learning is very similar too online schooling, instead of never going to school and constantly studying from home, students can attend some classes through a online or video conference. Students who do distance learning, have many disadvantages when being compared too regular learning in School. The students who participate in distance learning will not benefit from it.

First, distance learning can restrict certain students ability to learn through bad internet, old computers, and low financial struggles. Firstly, students who have bad internet connection can have many disadvantages, preventing students from benefiting in distance learning. Having a bad internet connection can slow you down, and could even cause a disconnection in the work you're doing. For example, at School the internet connection would be very weak for some students during the day, it would cause students too disconnect from the application while the rest of the class are working together. Secondly, students with old computers can have the same affect as slow internet but with even more disadvantages. Old computers can cause applications too glitch, making the venerability of getting viruses higher, and it could even cause newly made files non compatible when you try to run or download the file. The older the computer, the higher chance of problems too occur. Lastly, some students don't have the same financial struggles as other students. The low budget they have on purchasing supplies such as computers, laptops, and monitors can affect the way they study from home. Not being able too purchase certain supplies or latest models can have a heavy effect on the way students learn from home. At school, students with financial problems are placed in a special program too help them purchase the supplies they need at school for a low price or even for free. When these particular students try to participate in distance learning, they cannot appropriately participate in it. This makes basic learning at school a better decision for financial struggling students. Concluding, students with learning disadvantages do not benefit from distance learning.

Second, Distance Learning can be an easy way too cheat on given assignments through using notes that are not permitted on test day and searching up or sharing answers for an assignment. Firstly, students have the ability too cheat by using information handed to them in class, such as notes on tests. Cheating can lower your ability too learn, making Distance Learning non beneficial for students. For example, when students are given notes for a class, it is either saved online or physically placed in their folder. Students at home, doing distance learning usually have parents at work and don't have anyone at home to supervise over them. This setting allows students too cheat on tests and other important assignments by pulling out their notes and using it on tests. Secondly, students can also cheat by searching up or sharing answers for their homework and classwork. Sharing answers with classmates too complete an assignment lowers the creativity and effort put in, making distance learning less beneficial for students. For example, students can send messages to each other during class and get answers for certain questions too complete their assignment. In conclusion, Distant Learning is an easy way for students too cheat on assignments from home lowering the benefits of taking the program.

Others may find Distance Learning beneficial since it helps bullied students and those who struggle too find friends. Going to school has many benefits too it, such as building your friendliness, personality, and awareness too different cultures. First, Students who are friendly learn how too talk to other people at school. Second, building a personalty helps students be unique in a group of people allowing others to find him interesting too communicate with. Lastly, being knowledgeable of the different cultures that surround you builds your awareness of the different perspectives, people see.

Concluding, Distance Learning is not beneficial since all the ability students have an opportunity too misuse it for their advantage. Students who participate in Distance Learning can easily cheat on many of the assignments. Not only can they lack in effort too complete their assignment and still get a good grade, but having a disadvantage when learning, such as not having the supplies needed in order to complete an assignment can affect the benefits you get when working at home. Therefore, Distance Learning is not at all beneficial when compared too regular school learning.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D83F89166BD3,"Distance learning is an option offered by some schools that allow students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Every student has a different preference to learning. Some students prefer to take classes at school while others like to take classes at home. Students would benefit from taking classes at home because they can learn at their own pace, inclement weather wouldn't affect them, and they develop a sense of maturity.

Students that take online classes can work at their own pace. In high school there are all types of students. Some students prefer one thing over the other. Their are students who cannot focus in a classroom filled with other students in it. Students who have ADHD have a difficult time paying attention in the classroom full of students. It would be beneficial for them to have the option of taking online classes at home. By having the option of taking online classes, students with ADHD can work at their own pace, which could be beneficial for them since they can manage their own time and not be on a fixed schedule. Their are other students who can't grasp concepts as quickly as other students because of the pace in the classroom. Those students who do not understand the material that is being taught don't stick up for themselves because they don't want to interrupt the rest of the students that may be fine with the pace of the classroom. So online classes would benefit students who learn better with a slower or faster pace. Online classes allows students to work at their own pace. Students will learn better because they will not feel pressured to understand everything in the classroom all at once. Online classes allows each student to learn at their own pace.

Inclement weather effects the school system greatly. Snow days take a toll in the education that is being provided by teachers. Once bad weather hits, school county's call for days off. When students have snow days they do not do any work at home. They see snow days as a day to relax. Students already have a long summer break to relax, so snow days should still be considered as school days. Sometimes the weather is so bad that students are home for days; therefore, students dont do anything proactive. When the students do come back to school from snow days they have forgotten the materials that were taught by the teachers, resulting in the teachers reteaching the material, and being behind in the course schedule. However, If students took online classes they wouldn't have the problem of being home and not doing anything during snow days. Weather doesnt effect online classes because students dont physically have to attend public school, therefore transportation is not needed. Online classes could be really beneficial in times of inclement weather.

Online classes creates a sense of maturity. When students take online classes they have to get their coursework done on their own. Most adults would argue that students wouldn't take online classes seriously because they would just slack off on the work. However, online classes and public school classes are the same in the idea that the work needs to be done, but in online classes the work must be done independently. If the students don't take the coursework seriously they fail the class. In public schools, students have teachers babying and guiding them to success. In online classes, students are working independently. It creates a sense of maturity because they have to get the coursework done independently without the nagging of teachers. The skills they learn from online classes will be with them forever. In college their are some courses that are only offered online, so students who already have experience with online classes will be done by the deadline, and students that have been babied their whole life in public schools will suffer. Online classes develops a sense of maturity because students work independently in finishing the course by the deadline.

Public schools offering online or video conferencing is beneficial for the student. It is beneficial for students because they can work in their own pace. Inclement weather wont effect classes that are online, so students won't be subjected to not doing anything during bad weather. Online classes creates a sense of maturity in the students whereas they need to get their work done independently and on time. Schools offering distance learning is beneficial for students because it gives them options.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
299A4489B427,"The tremendous advancement in technology over the last couple decades has sponsered the growth of several new features. One such widely used feature is distance learning, the act of students undergoing classes remotely via online or video conferencing. This remote learning can be very advantageous to certain students who may not have enough time to undergo a specific class at school. However, traditional, hands on schooling is still much more benefical to students than distance learning, both in terms of academic advancement and developmental advancement.

Certain classes require hands on interactions to truly enable children to learn course material properly, and distance learning simply cannot provide these interactions. For example, a traditional science syllabus is wrought with expiraments, and by partipicating in these activites, students can witness what they are learning in the real world. As a result, students are able to better retain the information they were taught. For example, a standard biology class might involve learning about bacteria and bacterial growth. A student taking this course online will still recieve the information being taught in a traditional biology class, perhaps through a video lecture or an online reading. However, the students learning at school may be able to supplement the information that they have learned with a lab expirament that involves measuring the growth and properties of certain bacterial species. Thus, although both traditional learning and distance learning may provide the same overall course material, traditional learning offers more chances for students to better understand the content that they are presented with. Similarly, many english classes hold socratic seminars, activities where the class partipicates in a discussion revolving around a specific text. This type of activity results in students having a better understanding of the text, as they are subjected to the differing opinions of others. A student taking English online would most likely not have the opportunity to participate in a class wide socratic seminar, and they would thus understand the text they are engaged with less than a traditionally school student. These beneficial hands on activities are not limited to science and english courses. Many different classes rely on unique forms of interaction based activities, and students learning remotely would be placed at a great disadvantage by not being able to partpicate in these events.

Along with limiting the academic potential of students, distance learning also hinders the developmental growth of students. Tradtional schooling is a time in a person's life where they learn to interact with others and how to handle differing opinions. For example, partner projects present students with an opportunity to react to criticism and feedback. These learning experiences are things that students can use to succeed throughout their life. A student learning online would not be subjected to the same activities, and would thus be worse off than his or her fellow traditional students.

Distance learning is a new development that can be very beneficial when used in specific situations. For example, I needed to take physical education online two years because of certain course requirments and distance learning enabled me to complete these requirements. However, distance learning should not be something that is seen as a substitute to traditional, hands on learning. Although I was presented with the same information in my online class that other students who were taking physical education at school were subjected to, I am certain that their class enabled them to retain the information better. My online course syllabus did not include group oriented activities that I know that as a result, I could not learn the information to the best of my ability. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3F4D8262235A,"I think students would benefit doing school at home many kids maybe going through problems at home and could just be tired or maybe just annoyed of to much problems. Students working from home is good for kids that could be getting buliud either they speack up but dont see a change, having problems with adults here at school that don't really help much but just bring the student down, or maybe just being an anti socicl person. Online school is something really seroius to look into if tyour dealing with problems at home having so much stress in you and cant deal with more stress of school, or you just simply need to work to help out your family it could be a chance they need money but cant get enough to get bills paid and need help in paying them,maybe you dont really have time in showing up to school. I think online school is a good choice for many students that could have problems at school and not seeing a change. Students wouldn't have to get up so early in the morning having to look presentable or anything just having to have a good schealue that works good for both work and school. Both online work or video conferencing are good for kids that have their ways in learning like as in having videos chat with a teachers. Students can be fast learners just by reading insturstions they got it memorized and having the work ready in less than an hour. Others students are more to a visiual learners that have to see work getting it explaned to many time for them to undersatnd the work some students are slower than others. Online school would be the best choice to many students that just have it the ruff way and not easy. Other reason is because many kids get sick really easliy and its better to keep those kids away from others in getting sick. Online schools can really make a big change in kids that are just not ready have more stress in them and wouldnt have to deal with more problems with parents or maybe getting bullied. Oline schools would make a big change in those kids lifes in a positive way. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
9FEEF0F10C42,"Some school are offering classes were students can attend at home, the classes can be online or by video conferencing. Schools have been offering students classes that the students can take at home, but will it help the students? Some could see it both ways depending on the student, and how the student learns the best. Some students may benefit from attending classes from home, but some students may not.

Students may benefit from attending classes at home in the way, that some students may work better and or harder if they are working alone and one on one. There are students that know what they are doing and can figure it out on there own, but other students may not be able to. I do agree that the online classes may help some students, and some students may succeed in the classes.

Other students may not benefit from attending classes at home, some students may work better if they are with a teacher. There are many students that understand the material better if a teacher explains it to them one on one, or in a class. Students may find it easier to learn hands on, and have a teacher explain, and show them, and help the students understand the material.

Schools should offer classes that can be attend at home, because students can benefit from the classes taken at home. Also schools should let the student decide rather he or she would like to take the online classes, no school should just assign a student an at home class if he or she dose not want the class.

1927C4B37295,"The thought of participating in class activities from home is appealing to majority of society. Some schools have offered distance learning in their program for students wanting to learn from home. Many students get involved in accidents or situations that prevent them from arriving to school. Due to advancements in technology, student can have video conferences with their teachers. Students should benefit from attending classes from home because it allows for better communication, comfortable learning environments, and more attention to details.

First, students would benefit from taking classes at home by improving their communication with their teachers. During school hours, students may never get to fully understand the concept the teacher is teaching, for many other students are answering or asking the teacher's questions. Students working from home allows for them to sent emails, or rewind previous statements an instructor may have said. While in school, student may have a difficult time getting others to follow instructions or work together. Working from home allows students to have better communication and understanding of each other, and what they would be best for in an assignment.

An other way, students would benefit from involving themselves in classes at home is by having comfortable learning environments. At school, students normally sit at tables or desk; however, this can make the student extremely uncomfortable and distract them of the task presented to them. When at home, student have free roam to sit, stand, or lay down in any position they feel satisfied with. Many teachers have problems with food or beverages in their class rooms. While learning at home, a student can eat breakfest, lunch, or dinner without distracting the class, and students can learn more without having to get a break at home.

Some people will believe that students will get distracted easily when participating in class at home;however, student are more attentive while at home than at school. Many people have friends, family, or loved ones while at school. This can be distracting in various ways, but while at home, students are alone and have more time to focus on their school work. Students in every grade level are easily disturbed when someone they are acquainted with is around. While at home, parent can prevent disturbances in the household to allow the child to focus on their work.

Better communication, comfortable learning environments, and more attention to details are benefits of students attending classes from home. Student should be giving a chance to prove their independence and dedication to educational learning. By allowing students to work from home, they improve in all aspects of life, and they become successful individuals. Many people would be surprised to witness the changes it would bring to education. School districts should allows for students to work from home.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
78EE1B17A02D,"Home is where the heart is. Almost everyone is comfortable at their own house, especially if they're still growing up in it. When you are at the place you live you can be yourself, with limited outside noise. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be less distractions and more independence.

A lot of people enjoy working alone and believe they get more work done when they are alone. My first reason for why students would benefit from taking classes at home is that there would be less distractions. At my school there are almost two thousand people, which can be overwhelming sometimes. Being able to take classes at your house would allow students to focus on themselves and their work only, increasing how much work they get done and even how efficient the work is. For example, my mom works from home three to four times and she is always saying how nice it is. She enjoys being on her time schedule and believes she actually gets more work done when she is not in the office.

Another reason students could benefit from taking classes at home is that it allows more independence. Most people would rather work by themselves than in a group. At school sometimes you are forced to work with other people which can make students uncomfortable, and less productive. So having the opportunity to work alone, in your own house would surely be beneficial to many. An example can be myself, I am more comfortable working by myself than in a group. When in a group you have to rely on other people, by yourself its all on you to complete what is necessary and I enjoy having that independence.

Some may say that if this were to happen, students would not get any work done at home. That they would distract themselves with either their phone, the television, or even video games. I can see where they are coming from, but ultimately it is up to the student to do whatever they have to, its their grade and their future. I believe given this opportunity, more than 90% of students would take advantage of it and not allow themselves to get more distracted at home, than at school.

In conclusion, I am confident students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, as there would be less distractions and more independence. Distance learning should be an option at many, if not all school districts. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5082B266C097,"Some students are attending classes online through the school that offers it. This is also referred to as distance learning. Students are able to attend class by the use of online or video conferencing. Students may benefit from this, but ultimately they do not have a personal touch with the teacher and can often be less productive at home due to the difference in environment. At home, students are more distarcted and it causes them to procrastinate more. This deficit in learning can only hurt the student's academic career and overall success in the course. Attending class from home may also result in confusion and may need further clarity on how to perfrom a task. There is no teacher or instructor that is in touch with a student personally when they attend class from home. This is a massive problem that is carried by these academic options in learning and some students may even need extra help on various subjects that their parents are not professinal in. A classroom setting is also an extraordinary oppurtunity to branch out to others and become aquantinces with fellow classmates. Some friendships that students develop in school may last forever and this collaborative setting will develop their learning even further. The social aspect of school correlates with the academic process. Students that choose the option of distance learning do not benefit from being able to attend classes from home; their environment is too distracting, the deficit of assistance and their disability to reach out to classmates daily will lead to their future being compromised, academically and socially. Many might say the contrary, that attending classes from home will benfit people as students. This cannot be true, students will not benfit any more than how they are taught in class, and there are deficits in learning that come along with online academic options.

Students that are able to recieve help from teachers, counselors, and other staff is an enormous right for students to have. Students that recieve a personal touch with their instructor are able to develop their learning easier. As apposed to online classes, where technology is not as reliable as a real teacher. This ability to seek assistance is very conveient in a school setting because there are so many options that will benefit one's need for help. Students may also develop deeper relationships with their teacher, a relationship that is not the same via video conferencing. Students that have a healthy relationship with their teacher is wonderful, it is more comfortable to ask for help and when applying to college, jobs, etc. Teachers are a great source of a recommendation, especially ones that have gotten to know you personally.

Working at home can be a challenge for many people, especially students. Some students may even resort to studying in a library or coffee shop, due to increased work productivity. Their are simply way too many distractions at home that cause procrastination and counterproductive behaviors. These behaviors can lead to students not utilizing their full potential when it comes to academics. Students may even be attending classes from home when their parents are at work, so it is harder to recieve assistance from anyone. Since there are no parents around sometimes, there is the loss of authoritative actions. No one is home to stop their child from getting distracted and nor being on task. There are also less restrictions with the use of electronic devices.

Academics are extremely important, but it is argued that a socail life is equally as important. Many students main source of companions are derived from school. Other students in a classroom setting also help develop a new, dynamic way of learning. Collaboration is essential in everyday life as well as communication. When one gets a job, they are expected to utilize these skills in order to be more productive in the workplace. Online classes completely erase ones ability to make friends in school and can even become socially awkward and out of place in real-world environments. Attending classes online may have many benefits, but it is not nearly as productive in learning at school. Students that choose the option of distance learning do not benefit from being able to attend classes from home; their environment is too distracting, the deficit of assistance and their disability to reach out to classmates daily will lead to their future being compromised, academically and socially.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
28F2073AD0CD,"Many Students dread waking up extremely early every morning to go to school. Some schools have found an alternative for these students by offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to receive extra help, to learn in a comfortable environment, and to have more free time.

Attending classes online allows students to access help from online teachers and students more easily. By using online classes, students can ask the teacher as many questions as they need without being nervous of other students' opinions. Many students are anxious to raise their hands in school in fear of embarrassment. Younger generations feel very comfortable communicating with others online, so students could ask each other for help too. Video conferencing with teachers also allows one on one help. Teachers can spend more time with a student by giving them extra practice on a topic the student may struggle with. The method of face to face communication through video conferencing provides the same benefits as communicating with a teacher at school. This allows students to thoroughly understand subjects from home.

Learning in a comfortable environment is a major key in education. If students are in the comfort of their own home, whether its sitting on the couch or laying in bed, they are more likely to retain the information learned during class. They can even wake up and participate in classes while still in their pajamas. It is much easier to sit through lectures and participate in class while being comfortable instead of sitting in a sturdy, uncomfortable desk at school. Students do not have to worry about their appearance while using online school. This allows students to roll out of bed and participate in class without worrying about immediately brushing their teeth, taking a shower, or putting on presentable clothes. It also allows kids to participate in class even when they are sick. Learning from home gives students the ability to learn in an environment they feel safe and comfortable in to maximize their education experience.

Many students struggle to find time for extracurricular activities because of school. Online classes opens up more time for students to participate in extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs. Class schedules can be flexible to fit each student's own schedule. This will help balance their school and personal life and reduce stress. A current major issue many students face while in school is the lack of sleep they get. By attending classes from home, students can obtain extra needed sleep. Individuals will function and perform at their highest ability every day by getting the required amount of sleep. Every person is different, so attending classes at home can help students balance school and their own personal interests.

Distance learning allows a lot of benefits for students by taking classes at home. This allows them to obtain extra help, to learn in a safe and comfortable area, and to have more time for their own personal interests. Some students may prefer traditional schooling, however, it is clear that attending classes from home is the best path for many students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
A02E1D0BEACF,"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity.

Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide.

Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life.

My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college.

7FD4A314D751,"Students having the option to take classes online or from video conferencing is the smartest thing I ever heard. 70% of earth learns better online or from video conferencing. We are living in a new day in age technology is every thing now. Most teachers dont give assignments on paper they give their assignments to students on the computer. Teachers dont use chalk boards or textbooks they use computers and projector boards and all of that is technology.

learning online and from video conferencing is a great idea most people learn better when they're alone. When your in class you can easily get distracted by your classmates. People learn at different paces when your in class you may have to wait for someone to finish or they may be waiting on you to finish ,but when taking your classes online you can move on your on pace. When your out of school because you have a cold or sick you miss out on the stuff your teacher taught that day for example when I was sick I missed out on so much stuff I failed my test and my grade went from an A to a C- because I did not have the option to do it online ,but when you have the option to do work online or have a video conference you want have to be worried about missing out on the important stuff you're teacher taught.

I can see what can be bad about distance learning some students are not mature enough to do distance learning.

When students are at home they may play their games or be on their phone other then doing the work they are given to do. Students can also cheat and not get the right amount of education they need. Therefore distance learning is just good for the mature students to do only. People that are anti social can use this so they want have to communicate with other people ,but when your in class you can grow out of being shy.

I feel that we should be able to deiced or have the option to learn from home because I think that is the next step of learning in the near future. The whole world should give it a chance it could change the way we learn for the greater good. Therefore I believe we would really benefit the whole world if we do this act.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
2B6B50852E0B,"I am not agree that students would benefit attending classes from home. the students will not be able to know more people. They will spend time only at home. They would not know how fun is attend school. There are some people who can't attend school but they know how it feels being at the school.

The people who takes classes from home is not able to meet people. I think know people around you is a good point. Students could be more comfortable having people around them. I think stay at home everyday could stress out the students. They feel more freely being at school.

The students will spend the whole day at home. I think for some of them would be boring stay at home because in some cases they can't attend school. Spend a lot of time behind a screen could hurt them eyes. They could feel stressed being at home without not having friends to hang out. They could feel lonely not having friends to comunicate or spend time.

The people who attend classes from home will miss how is the school. They miss what happens during the day in a classroom. They don't know how great is meet your friends and walk around the school. They miss the great and fun activities in the school and classroom. They don't have the same fun of being in the school,work with partners,groups and know people from other places.

It is a good thing attend classes online or video conferencing and it benefit the students to focus more in classes but i am disagree. I am disagree because i think is a good thing have people around you and make friends. Be out of home would be a good way to stay out of stress and feel more comfortable. Being at school could be a good way to be happy,participate in activities and talk with people than being in four walls the whole day.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
242E9BA55C0C,"Distance learning is an ever-growing way of reaching students that are unable, or unwilling, to attend a traditional school. Creating a way for students to attend classes from home is a very practical and useful innovation, and through it, many students will receive education that they might not otherwise get. By implementing computer learning on in a widespread manner, students from all backgrounds and economic standpoints will be able to learn and succeed. Students will also be able to stay up to date with schoolwork if an illness or other injury prevents them from going to school for long amounts of time. Distance learning can also help those who are unable to access a school, such as rural families.

One of the leading arguments for the cause of widespread poverty in inner cities is poor education programs. In areas such as Generic_City, schools are understaffed and underfunded, leading to very high dropout rates. Families that can afford to, send their children to private schools, often costing thousands of dollars per year. Distance learning could solve this problem. By creating a county wide virtual learning database, students can pursue their education without having to be in school. Although some of these students may not have access to a computer, libraries are available for those driven and determined to better themselves.

There are many cases in which an injury or illness precludes students from going to school. Both physical and mental health issues can result in the inability to attend traditional school. Distance learning could be a lifesaver for these students. By giving them access to lessons, homework, and tests, they are able to stay up to date and current, even if being out of school for several months. Car accidents are a leading contributor to students having to stay home for long periods of time. Injuries to the spine or head can result in limited mobility or capabilities for extended amounts of time. Because of this, students often have to graduate later than planned, which can jeopardize college acceptance and scholarships. Through distance learning, students can stay engaged and up to date with classroom activities, and lessen the impact of missing school for extended amounts of time.

Rural areas in states across the U.S. often have very low standards of education. Due to people living very spread out and secluded from one another, school systems are haphazard and low quality. Students in rural areas also often have to help out with either a farm or a business and are unable to attend school during a traditional school day. This is where distance learning plays a part. Through the use of computers to access video lessons, students can take classes on their own schedule and from their own homes.

Although distance learning seems like an ideal way to learn, there are several downsides to it. One of which is a less flexible curriculum. Due to lessons being in video form, teachers are unable to tailor lessons to fit the needs of particular students or classes. This can lead to students being unresponsive and not being able to learn the material due to the way that it is presented. Because of this, students may have to seek out additional resources to fully understand the material that is being presented to them.

Distance learning is an exciting and innovative form of learning that is being put into place around the world. Through the use of online lessons and videos, students who do not have access to traditional schools are given a chance to learn. Distance learning gives a voice to those who are often overlooked and forgotten, and gives them a way to better themselves and succeed. Though not without it's flaws, distance learning can be very beneficial to students taking classes from home. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
8A0A3FE01FE7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Many believe sitting in a classroom is better for students education, but others believe it more reliable for online or video conferencing. Distance learning won't give you the same benefit as sitting in a classroom. Its more reliable to sit in classroom because if not you could fail, system can shut down, and you'll be getting more physical help in a classroom.

Many like distance learning because it's more flexible, but because it's really flexible a lot of people have a higher chance at failing then passing. Imagine, a lot of people don't like waking up at six in the morning to get ready for school, so what would you expect from a student who stays home. He/she could wake up late and still miss there class which means they're missing the material and education they need. Others irresponsible students will forget about the class and they won't care on doing the work. They will have the mindset of ""it's online, i can finish it later"". Many student fail to do there work because of laziness and for being irresponsible. Especially, if the weather is nice outside many students tend to make plans and won't have the same attention towards school like before. In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done..

Numerous of computer's systems shut down because of many different reason. If this were to happen to a distance learning student, they wouldnt be able to log in. Some systems take hours, day, and maybe even weeks to get fixed. Other computers have trouble accessing internet. Without any internet, no student will be able to do any online class or video conferencing. Another problem with computers are, that the power goes out. If you computer or any cellular device is not charged where would you be able to plug it in? How would you get your classes done? How would you turn the things you need in on time? These are a few question people dont stop and think about. Therefore, because of these troubleshooting problems it best to go in to a classroom.

All students have many different learning skills. Some prefer physical help instead of visual learning. Learning the material physically is way more reliable to learn easier and faster. Physical learning can help people get there work done faster, easier, and not get distracted by other things around them. Students can be more focused on their work and get it done on time. Others say the environment in which there in doesn't matter as long as there focued , but to other people it does matter. While students are at home they can easily get distracted and forget they have work that needs to be done. this will cuase many students to fail and would have to retake the course.

101C3E9B985D,"In a time where technology is creating more and more opportunities and options, there is no longer a need to maintain all traditional education methods. With new technology, online learning is becoming more and more prevalent in many parts of the world. Regular schooling has been a great benefit for centuries, but is becoming almost antiquated through its limitations in today's world. For the modern student with busy schedules, on-campus learning seems to be a time-consuming ball and chain. Although this may be the case for most students, the second option is becoming more popular. Online classes are beneficial to students because there is no longer a need for students to physically show up to class, and there is no longer a need for teachers to come to school.

First, without the need for students to physically be at school, several limitations are already eliminated. With the introduction of online learning there will be fewer absences. For example, when I was sick with bronchitis for a week near the end of the marking period, I had missed out on two tests and could not turn in one project. I would've benefited from an online course, where I would've turned in my project and take my tests online When students are sick, or lack transportation, they lose the opportunity to learn and grades suffer; Through online conferencing, the lessons are still being given and students still attend class. Though it can be said that students will not be motivated to attend online classes, the freeing of student schedules will make learning feel like what it is, an academic opportunity, rather than a chore. Without the shackles of classroom learning and bad school lunches, students will jump at the chance to become career ready and guarantee their future.

Then, with online lessons and video conferences, there is no longer a need for teachers to come to school. Without the limitation of the classroom, teachers would not have to have substitutes. I can remember many times where substitute teachers did not teach lessons, but only passed out busy work; It was a waste of a class period. Our entire class had done nothing but two word searches for hours. Students won't benefit from busy work periods, which only makes school feel more like a chore. In addition, students would not have to stay after with teachers to make up work or to tutor. With online classes, lessons can be reviewed and questions can be asked online, eliminating the need for after-school tutoring and the worry of student transportation.

In conclusion, with the diffusion and development of online classes, students have much to look forward to. Although classroom learning will be changed, it will most likely not be completely phased out by online learning. Instead of discarding traditional learning, schools should still maintain important values such as individual learning and support from teachers. It's important to hold on to time-proven methods but to also be inviting to change where beneficial, as we should do with all things that are out with the old, and in with the new.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FF13996AB0B3,"Although some say schools shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students would not get enough educations away from school, actually students should have benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

However, some say school shouldn't offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn't get enough knowledge at home, it's better in school.

Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students don't understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didn't know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google.

Second, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. Also, I remembered when I had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was I didn't learned anything from chemistry class. Because my teacher was horrible, I didn't learned anything from him. So, I searched to Edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. Then, I face timed a Chemistry teacher from Edubirdie. I spend like 10 hours with her. It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and I'm happy with it.

In conclusion, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because it gains knowledge and helpful for future education.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7E8238B5BA1C,"Some people would say that it is the heavy cost of a social life to take classes online instead of going to a traditional brick and mortar school. They believe that by taking online classes, people are less equipped in dealing with face-to-face interactions in the real world when the time comes. However, these people also fail to consider that there are flaws in brick and mortar schools which can burden those who prefer an option of taking classes online instead. Although some may believe otherwise, it would heavily benefit students to be able to attend classes at home because there are some people who prefer not being in a physical classroom, there are less cases of missing class from emergencies, and there are more flexibilities given to students.

One reason why students would benefit to attend classes from home is if they have limited social skills and they are not comfortable with vocally situating themselves in a physical classroom. A personal situation which displays this is my cousin Generic_Name, who decided to take online classes starting his first year of middle school due to his severe anxiety since 4th grade which made it hard for him to interact with other students since he was younger. His anxiety also impacted him since it became more difficult with concentrating and asking for guidance from teachers, in fear of them judging him for it. However, after finishing his first year of online school, Generic_Name had claimed that by taking his courses online, he felt more comfortable in pursuing help from his teachers in courses he struggled with and concentrate without thinking about the impending presence of other students. If Generic_Name had not taken online courses for his schooling and had gone to a brick and mortar school instead, he would have felt more miserable since that was where he would have been forced to have physical interactions in order to resolve his academic problems and the stress it brought to him would also hinder his ability to learn.

Another reason why it would positively impact students to take online courses from the comfort of their homes is because there are less likely scenarios of a student missing their classes from any kind of emergency. A case which exemplies this is from another cousin, named Generic_Name, who is currently taking his school courses online admist the epidemic of the corona virus. The corona virus, which wildly spread in his hometown of Generic_City, prompted his school district to take measures in making students continue their academic courses online without the risk of exploiting students in schools where a virus is likely to spread. By making the decision for students to continue classes through online means instead, there are less chances of Generic_Name's school district of possibly extending the school year to make up for all missed days. Without the option of being able to attend classes from home, both Alex and his school district would have been negatively affected by the epidemic from possible delays in schools to a higher chance of catching the virus. Another person who illustrates why attending online courses prevents missing class for emergencies is from a situation my childhood friend Generic_Name had two years ago, when her older sister Generic_Name, who lived in Generic_City, got into a heavy car accident and Generic_Name and her single mother sponantiously made plans to go visit her since Generic_Name could not stay home alone. However, since Generic_Name had been taking her academic courses online, it did not make it hard for her to catch up on her work because all she really needed was a computer and there was no need for her to be in a physical classroom to participate. By being able to take her classes by ways of online, Generic_Name's school work did not heavily interfer with the sudden emergency and she had the flexibility of doing her work no matter where she was.

Lastly, it would be beneficial for students to be able to take classes online because it gives more flexability to students with a busy personal life. For instance, Emma Chamberlain, a popular YouTuber known for her witty persona, had dicussed in a video that she decided to take her junior high school year through online classes because she wanted to focus on her rising career. Her decision to do so was very intelligible in the end, given the fact that she mainly filmed videos throughout the day and frequently traveled across the U.S. due to job opportunites and sponserships from brands. Without the flexibility given to her from online classes, Emma would not be able to do what she constantly does today which would mean having less time in being able to film her videos and seeking out her passions of being a prominent figure in YouTube. Another person who illustrates this is my same friend Generic_Name, who had a demanding part time job at a cafe during the morning of school weekdays in order to finacially support her family. Since she took her academic courses online, she was able to have a flexible shift and work for longer hours because there was no given time that she had to be present in class. If she had not been doing school through online means, it would not have been possible for her to take on the job at an hour where most students are actively learning in school.

Although some people make it seem taboo that attending classes online is an option a person would rather take than a tradional school, there are clearly a lot of positive aspects of deciding on taking one's classes online. By choosing to not take a traditional school, an individual is able to focus more than just their academic life and able to take on more opportunites that most likely would not be given if it were not for this barrier. Also, attending classes online pushes a person on being more independent because it is ultimately all on them to juggle with their own academic and personal life. Although attending classes online might not be for everyone, it goes to show that there are many benefits one can take from it.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
D7858B9A54CE,"Learning Through a Screen: Fiction or Reality?

The rapid evolution of technology has not only changed, but shaped the way humanity lives. Innovations such as the computer and smart phone have made life more convenient through services such as online shopping and food delivery. These devices also promote the ease of communication, with applications such as text messaging and social media assisting with the relay of information. Unfortunately, this major function of computers and smart phones is not only underutilized, but demonized. Students are often accused of spending too much time on their devices, especially during class, and the only solution seems to be to take away their electronic devices and direct their attention back to the dreary, boring classroom. These ""forbidden"" devices, however, can enhance the learning process and through their increased prevalence and use in academics, schools could see the end of traditional classes in classrooms in favor of ""distance learning"". Although many believe electronic devices serve little to no purpose in educational settings other than to capture and divide students' attention, the exclusive use of these devices from home and the bypass of classroom learning provides a host of benefits to students.

To start, learning from home is convenient. Students no longer need to commute to and from the school, many of which need to wake up early to catch the bus or use gas and drive. This gives leeway for students to wake up later and enjoy more hours of sleep each night, which is especially important as many suffer from sleep deprivation, leading to poor performance and lowered concentration.

Learning online also eliminates the need to purchase and manage a large quantity of school supplies and materials. Each class demands different supplies, so depending on the class, students need to make sure they have pencils, erasers, color pencils, highlighters, scissors, glue sticks, pens, and more. Another major problem is the sheer amount of material that is received from classes. Project rubrics, assignments, study guides, and notes are often printed on physical paper that need to be kept, and students can't afford to lose them or they risk falling behind. Weather concerns are also an issue, such as heavy rain soaking homework and rendering it illegible, contributing to how fragile these critical papers are. Each and every day, students need to carry both these supplies and materials with them when commuting from class to class. This takes a heavy toll through heavy backpacks, sore shoulders, and poor posture, which as a student, is a great struggle and has negative effects outside of school as well. Traditional schools also carry health concerns, as having so many alumni in a proportionally small building allows sickness and disease to spread quickly, such as the growing concerns over the recent COVID-19 virus. Distance learning only requires computer and can be done from home, which keep alumni safe at home and lowers their stress levels, allowing them to stay focused on learning.

Secondly, students attending class online have a myriad of resources available to to them that only the internet can offer. For example, applications such as Blackboard Collaborate have video conferences with chat rooms where the teacher speaks and the students can listen. This process promotes equal participation among students, as those who were previously too shy to raise their hands in a classroom setting can simply type out their answer in the chat. Students can also quickly search up an unfamiliar term of concept without halting the class to ask a question, allowing for steady progress for the class and prevents it from falling behind the schedule. Other applications such Google Classroom help students stay organized by keeping all of their deadlines for classes in one place as opposed to writing every deadline down in an agenda. In Google Classroom, teachers can choose to set specific time deadlines such as having assignments due at 9 or 10 P.M. as opposed to having students turn them in the next day. This forces students to practice proper time management skills, as waiting until late at night to finish homework and assignments will result in them being late. Finally, the Student Information System is a helpful tool that shows the status of grades to students and parents so they can see what skills need improvement. All of these applications are easily accessible through their website or mobile app, giving ease of access to students and helping them stay organized and engaged.

With all the freedom that technology provides, some are concerned that students won't use them for their intended purposes. One proposed solution is to issue school laptops to alumni to prevent cheating. Many have ""lock down browsers"" that prevent students from opening different tabs when taking assessments. School issued laptops also solve the issue of devices being expensive, giving equal opportunity for all to participate in distance learning programs. Another method to prevent cheating are plagiarism checkers, which are typically used to scan a document of plagiarism. Through this, students are unable to simply copy and paste material into their assignments, ensuring the integrity of all work that is submitted online.

Technology is an under appreciated tool in the field of academics that has only began to gain traction recently. The convenience it provides and the wealth of resources that are readily available to students make it a viable alternative to traditional teaching. In the near future, it is almost certain that more schools will transition to distance learning, and the general population should be more aware of its benefits, and to not shy away from it. As humanity progresses deeper though the digital age, integrating more technology into daily lives, it needs to be prepared to face major change to its norms.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
27ADAEF01316,"In the digital age, distance learning is emerging as a technological alternative to attending class in person. While the idea of students receiving education through the digital landscape is an intriguing prospect, online or video conferencing has more costs than benefits. Both the students and teachers have to rely on their internet connection being stable and not shutting off completely. There is no physical work to assess knowledge. The important social aspect of school is lost in an era where it is sorely needed. These are just a few quirks in a fundamentally flawed system.

The internet while powerful, is simultaneously fickle. For online learning to succeed, a stable internet connection is required. It is doubtful that every single student will have that luxury. Online learning is especially vulnerable at the time when it would be the most useful, which is in harsh weather conditions. A snowstorm or thunderstorm could take out the internet and nullify the entire operation. Another option could be for the teacher to create and assign a video for the students to watch. This is not ideal because teaching in real-time can be vital in the learning process.

Despite the beliefs of students, it has been proven that physical work such as worksheets increase the rate at which they grasp the source material. A student may believe they understand what has been taught but can receive the worksheet and realize they don't fully understand. Projects allow the class to flex their creative muscles and show the teacher something of their very own. Science labs allow for a hands-on approach that puts the lesson in a different perspective. Simply laying in bed at home doing online assignments simply cannot have the same effect.

Many people will not admit it, but school is where we also learn how to cultivate relationships. Most children make their very first friend in the classroom. Learning how to socialize is a key skill in life that will get you very far. Children don't have many opportunities to meet people because they have no places to go. In the age of social media, having actual relationships in real life is more important than ever.

If the stars do align for an online class to perform as intended, it can allow for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for the students. However, it is simply unsustainable as a long term option.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0016926B079C,"I think that students would benefit from learning at home,because they wont have to change and get up early in the morning to shower and do there hair. taking only classes helps them because at there house they'll be pay more attention. they will be comfortable at home.

The hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then you'll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear.

most students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go.

when your home your comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.              ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
F24E35F969B0,"Online classes are actually very beneficial when it comes to high school or college students these days. Yes, taking actual classes at school help because you have a teacher there to help you, but it takes a big chunk out of your day when you could be doing something else as equally important. Students have so many responsibilities and its hard to keep up with all at once and decide what to do first or even to prioritize first. Thats why online classes or video conferencing is helping many students these days.

Classes online help tremendously for students. They have more time and space for learning or even studying at home. Students get to learn in a comfortable environment of their own home everyday. Even when they are super busy that day they can choose a time whenever, instead of having to go to class and knock something else out of the way for it. Of course they have deadlines, but they would get to study on their own time. Teens, even grown ups, are so busy with so many different responsibilities just in one day. Its hard to have classes on campus when you have work, or other classes you need to study for. It puts a lot of stress on peoples shoulders when they have so much to do at once, in one day.

Stress is a big thing for teens, college students and grown ups right now in this time. Taking online classes or having video conferences help a lot because you would have downtime for yourself, to regain mental stability and get some stress taken off of your shoulders so you can relax. Having so much to do at once in one day is mentally and physically draining for everyone, no matter what age. These classes would help so much with people who are either going through something and don't have a lot of time to go to a physical class everyday. Online classes and conferences are so very beneficial when coming to mental health and a copious amount of stress (which most people have).

Families with kids dont get to see them that often when they have school or even work. Its hard to spend time with your family when all you do is go to work and study, because thats all teens and grown ups ever do now. Online classes are a big help to that. Having your own schedule is so nice because now you can stay at home and get home work done at your own pace and schedule, even if your family is there. Family is one of the biggest thing for many people, family should always come first and its hard to make them your number one priority when you have loads of work and studying to do, in a way its not fair.

Online classes and video conferences help with maintaining a good strong bond with your family and even friends. They are so helpful when having a copious amount of responsibilities on your plate.

It may not always be easy but at the end of the day online courses and video conferences help so much with so many responsibilities that are on your plate. You have space for learning, your mental health, time for work and family, and maybe even some time for studying for different classes.

Online work isn't always as bad or as difficult as it seems, there are so many pros and very little cons when it comes to online classes for grown ups, college students and teens. In the end its very beneficial and helpful for most students.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
1DB195AA7BE3,"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online .

My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas .

Examples:

If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online.

If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class.

With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home .

If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time .

Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it 's not easy .

I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing.

One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace .

My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult .

My reference is the option class

FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2
D58980F5EC66,"I believe this would benefit students around the world, students would be able to attend classes from any school no matter where students live, this would help students who live far way from school and can't get a ride to school. Attending classes online from home would make it more comfortable for students.

Distance learning is good thing for students that want to study in school around the world or get the best education, students can be at home taking some classes that their country does not offer. Let's say a student lives in France and the student takes classes from United States, that's a good benefit, because you are learning education from another country in a different way that your country teaches you. This will be good for students who live in different country temporarily and are coming back to their countries.

The schools that offer distance learning are making life easier for some students who can't get education of they have to walk for hours to go to school. I remember watching a video about girl's life where she explains how far she has to walk though the mountains for 4 hours just to get to school. There are students who can't get education, because of the places they live, like places that are cold or far way from the city. This a good benefit in the United States since there's is a virus called corona virus in some states people are already effect with it, schools are closing cause of that students will be talking classes at home.

In school some students feel uncomfortable of working with their teachers or classmates, that makes students to stop working or lose interest on their work, but when they are home school students feel more comfortable, because they are at their house with their family, they feel more safe at their house and they can trust their family. In schools one of the main reasons why students feel uncomfortable of going to class is because some students get bully by their classmates, others get peer pressure to try to do things they don't like or be something they are not, making students not to be themselves. There was this famous video of a kid who was crying and told his mom that he wanted a knife to kill himself, he was just 7 years old, the reason why he wanted to kill himself is because many people at his school make fun him for being small, the students at his school were bullying him so much that he had to be home school and get therapist to help him get better and be comfortable.

At the end being able to attend classes at home depends if the students like it not everyone would think this is a good benefit for students others would think that is bad for students to take classes at home, because students will not get the chance to be social with other, this will make students not be able to work or talk with others outside in person, because they spent so much time at their houses taking classes by themselves. I have friend who used to be home school, now he goes to a high school and because he was home school, he doesn't talk that much in school, he doesn't have that many friends, it takes a while to get to know him. Taking classes from home is only good benefit if you want to take classes from another school, can't go to school because of where you live or it takes too long to walk to school, and if you don't feel comfortable in school, those are the main reasons students would taking classes from home. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8D49AD0975A1,"In my Opinion, students would not benifit from being able to attend classes from home, teacher hele, more study,career opportunity, and activity can students get in the school.In home student they dont get extra advantage .

In home student can not get other activie, fun with friends, and good career opportunity. Some student work full time. they don't have time to more study they not cater to study. Tndeed, they not get doploma in two year.My friend His mane is PROPER_NAME.He take online classes in home.He has more then two year with this program his still surivial with this program.The class time is two houre if he not understand in this time nobody explian after that.He also pay $500 for one semater. And classes on two days a week.These program take long time.

Students can access in the classes, like teacher attention, class work writing and if students not understand, teacher can help their separatly. Teacher can assist the students together as well as teacher know the in the where is my this student is week, in readin, writing, listning teacher can more prepare for student.Sometime in the class other student can help our fellow.In the class if teacher are not avabile, school have other opportunity substitute. students also can stay after school for particie test, quiz,and other activity.

School have extra advantage for students. Work ppportunity, volunteer with school program, fun activity, games ,these thing is reassure to students.In colleges and schools have work programs access.Student can study and work is samw place.Schools amd colleges give to students access to make your on scchdule for work.First you finish you classes and after you can do your work in same place.Also school have social worker they can help whatever you can tell.In LOCATION_NAME alot programs you help by school.

Conclusion,better for students to take classes in school.Evening program, extra advantage, teacher reclaim, work opportunity, volunteer, for college recommend latter, ,school social worker help these all advantages avabile in school not in online school.

9FD5F5EAA8E3,"Some benefits the students have it in many ways

I think , in my opinion to take class in online thats not good ways for learned. Because it is so dificult for they understand what the teacher is talk about it is there when they became confused and dont have it any benefits for them . This so new for them this is making that the students take time to assimilate what the teacher say it and learining . There is when the teacher become teach it they dont know what they doing because they don't have the cofidence we they teachers because you feel weird to talk we someone you dont know . Sometimes it is more better take normal class at schools for some students it is easy ways to learned because have time after school for making anything they nedd to make .

First reason, Some student are confused when they take this class in online for any reason it is so dificult . Also dont have any benefits for them this it is because some students become confuse to understannd what it is class about because they dont pet attencion because the class turned boring to taking the class in this forms . Some student have some troubles with the language, because they dont know english this making they become confused, and some of them fell the class because dont talking they can not expressing they self to talk .

Another it is because the student , at home attendent be more lazy's and have more trouble to concetrated. Because they have more distraction , At home this why I think have class in online have consecuencies because they dont learning any they have distracion eg, som distracion are phone, taking, and tv .

Second reason , some student's can not assimilated what teacher's say it because have problem with the internet in dont is clear what they talking . Sometimes the student's does like the class in online and more hurt to learn. Eg, Some students are not prepared for tecnology,

I mean with this they dont not how use it hte computer or making any work . Eg when the students come to school dont understand the teacher ask to them inmedialy they explain and you undderstand . But this class at computer are so diferent t to get what the teachers are teach during class.

Third reason ,some times it is more good take class at schools . Because Take class at school have good benefits you learnig many things if any diffult for you to understand . Because anything you dont understand you can asked you teachers, anytime you want and have better grades at class .

Some students can stayed after school make the work you dont make it , finished work that you not done during class, and retake test .

sometimes it is good have it class at school becuase you know more people in have someone that you talk this so help for some peoples for when they are stressfull .

I think to come at schools have it more benefits, that have it class in at online. Because schools are first important place where can you learned dont have any trouble for making the work turn more easy for us . Also class online for me it is secundary , because you need to have more knowleges in many forms one ways it is ;

taking, speaking and know how to use it the computer fast. In this class some times the student dont put attencion they dont get any thing, if becuase difficult this making some students fell in class in online.

Students have many oportunities because the teacher's take the time to help the students after school in this good for students because they finished the work fast and know more about it.     ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
6B36E17606DE,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. In other words, Students should have the option of attending a public school or online school at home. If students choose to do online school at home, the education should be the same as public schools. Some individuals may disagree because they believe students will not to do their work, or take online school serious. Students should have the option of taking online school at home because their able to get a full night sleep, allowed to start online school whenever they want, and can control how fast or slow the lessons are going.

Students are able to get a full night sleep. Studies have shown that students should get about seven hours of sleep per night. On an average school night most students get five to six hours of sleep. On a normal school night, that is the most students are going to get. The biggest reason why students do not get a lot of sleep is because they stay up doing homework. Most people in high school either have activities or sports they are involved in. These activities can make individuals tired to the point where they end up doing their homework late at night. Students should have the option of doing online school so they are able to sleep in, and feel well rested in the morning.

Teenagers have the ability start school whenever they choose. In this time period teenagers are treated like young adults and our capable of making decisions by themselves. If the student feels tired in the morning, there is no start time for online school. For example, if there is a test they have to take the individual should be well rested and not tired. In Virginia, most high schools start around seven in the morning. These students are still teenagers and their brain has not fully developed yet. Teachers expect students to have gotten plenty of sleep the previous night. In fact, some students only get three hours of sleep which is not good for the body or the brain. With being said students have the opportunity on when they can start their lessons for school.

High scholars have the option of going at their own paste. Everyone is different and moves at a different speed than some people. With various classes students have to pass, not every student will quickly finish them. People tend to take a longer time with math, and may need extra time to understand the concept their learning. With taking school online you will not have a teacher at the front of the class room teaching. If you are a student who understands what is being taught, you dont have to wait on others to understand the concept. Working at your own paste can possibly help the student stay on task, and help them learn the lesson more efficiently. By working at your own paste and slowing things down can potentially help the student in a positive way.

Offering online learning for students at home might be beneficial to students. If students got nine or ten hours of sleep each night, their grades for their classes could be very high. With getting nine or ten hours of sleep students could start school in the middle of the day if they wanted, feeling well rested. Everyone is different in their own ways, and taking some classes in a slower paste doesnt hurt the student. If some schools offered online school for students to attend at home, this would open a positive aspect in a students life. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

F18093A3093A,"Technology now helps and makes everyday life easier, and it's never gonna stop evolving. Technology is used in many different ways like shopping and for learning. Schools are now implementing technology in their classrooms like personal school given computers or a smart board, they even let students take online courses. Schools are letting their students choose whether or not they want to take those courses, do you think they can benefit from these online courses?. I think the question should be can they be consistent and be willing to focus if they take these courses.

Students can surely benefit from taking classes from home, they wouldn't be interrupted or distracted by their fellow students. They would also benefit how they can wake up late and not worry about getting to school on time. These things sound like its nice in which it is, but can these students be willing to but in the effort to learn or can they learn from these courses. One of the flaws from taking the online classes is that, the student wouldn't be able to interact with the teacher. They wouldn't be able to ask questions if they don't understand in private of course you can send an email, but you can't teach through an email. Students wouldn't have that helping hand because a student can say they understand the material, but they could be doing it wrong and having a teacher by your side would mean she can hep you directly.

The flaws of taking an online course doesn't just fall on how they wouldn't be able to communicate, but also the students will to focus. Distractions are everywhere it doesn't matter where you are or who you are someone can eaasily become distracted, but there will always be someone who can bring you back to focus. Students get distracted easily and for a teacher their job iis to ensure that they unnderstand the material that they are supposed to learn. By taking these online courses their wouldn't be anyone to help them focus and make sure they are not distracted. One of the biggest distractions for students are phones if their taking this course from home they will be interupted by their phones and they'll lose focus or just lose the interest in learning. With phones being in their possession it will be much easier for them to cheat of the internet, so now they wouldn't learn because they have the answers in their hands. The other example is that they'll simply become lazy and just not do their work. They'll be no teachers to help them and guide them, teachers play such an important roll in schools they are their to help so why take that away.

Teachers are always their to help and someone on a computer won't be able to see how a student's day is going while with teachers they can see that. They will be willing to take some private time with the student and make sure they're doing ok. Now should an online courses be given, no, or depending on the students yes, but I think they wouldn't benifit as much as just going to school because in school you can meet new friends and have a good relationship with teachers.          ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7B6F9C7801B2,"I groaned as I got up from bed, groggily rubbing my eyelids as I remembered today was Monday, signaling the start of another exhausting school week. Attending schools so that students can become educated is outdated compared to the option of students being able to learn from home online, especially in a technological world. Although some may believe otherwise, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because many online classes allow for flexibility, ensure the safety of students, and encourage individuality in learners.

First of all, students would have greater flexibility in their schedules through online classes, which will then help students improve in academics and talents. For example, my friend Generic_Name has been home schooled ever since she started grade school, her parents utilizing online classes to educate her. The only difference between her and a school student was that Generic_Name went through her classes at a comfortable pace, without having to sit idly through pointless lectures that were not actually beneficial to her learning, leaving more time during the rest of the day to focus on her love for singing. As a matter of fact, Generic_Name's academic success did not decrease at all due to her taking online classes, shown by her scholarship from the University of California. Some may say that students who take online classes from home will not improve academically due to the absence of the physical presence of a teacher. While this view is understandable, it is incorrect because students who attend online classes do just as well as students who learn at school. An example that represents this is the online education course known as Khan Academy, famous for its in depth lessons for various aspects of learning. In particular, my friend Generic_Name took advantage of the online SAT classes the course had to offer, which led to him achieving a great score of 1470 on the August SAT. Similarly, my friend Generic_Name, who had attended classes all summer long at a school, earned the same score even though supposedly, he was supposed to do better since he was learning from an actual teacher. The flexibility online classes offer impact the students only in a positive manner.

Secondly, attending classes from home would eliminate any potential school related risks to students and benefit their health, which will advocate for a safe environment. For example, during my licensing ceremony, the driving police officer explained to the entire room about how the most dangerous intersection in one of the largest counties in the world, the crossing between Generic_City, happened to be directly across from a high school. As a student of Generic_School, I personally witness this experience every single day and know that mixing drowsy teen drivers with heavy traffic across an intersection is a dangerous combination. By allowing students to attend classes from home, the risk of accident related injuries, and even deaths, to students on their way to school would almost be completely eliminated, which is crucial to the protection of teenagers and children. Some may argue that online classes from home have no real health benefits. While this view may be understandable, it is incorrect because students that attend classes from home have many greater benefits to their health through the improvement of sleep, shown by many scientific studies stating that teenagers require at least 8 to 9 hours of sleep a night, but less than half of the population get this amount. As a swimmer with practices every morning but long assignments every night, dark circles under my eyes and sleeping during class has become a daily routine. By allowing students to attend classes from home, teenagers are able to follow their sleep patterns of sleeping later and not having to wake up as early in the morning, leaving them much more alert and satisfied. Eliminating the health risks posed to students by schools allows them to focus solely on their academics.

In addition, classes from home allows students to cultivate their own individuality through the removal of peer pressure, leading to better ideas from students that will improve the world. For example, Oprah Winfrey, one of the country's most renown television personalities, faced bullying and criticism for expressing her individuality as a child. Discontinuing her school career, Winfrey was freed from her shackles of peer pressure and later started the popular television series known as The Winfrey Show, where she could proclaim her unique philosophies that she had been cultivating ever since she was younger. Winfrey was determined to make the world a better place by encouraging younger adults to control their independent lifestyles and live a life of encouragement. Some may say that classes from home decreases the ability of students to be able to cooperate among each other. While this is understandable, it is incorrect because students who are confident in their unique selves are able to cooperate better with other people. For example, Albert Einstein, a famous scientist and mathematician, was expelled from grade school due to his extreme curiosity. Afterwards, he cultivated his own knowledge and later on cooperated well with a team of scientists during WWII to develop the atomic bomb. Attending class from home allows students to discover themselves and create a diverse environment.

A society in which students are able to attend classes from home would benefit greatly due to positive impacts. Especially in a world where rising global problems are becoming more imminent, such as the risk of COVID-19 and an increasing threat of global warming, students that are confident in their own abilities, cooperative with others, and knowledgeable are becoming more crucial. We must advocate for an environment in which students can comfortably learn by promoting an online class education system where students can attend classes from home.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
4F7A79EFD3AB,"In Todays society theres a lot of conversation about allowing students to take online courses from home . While many may not like this idea it is overall beneficial to the students, it allows them to learn at their own pace , prevent them from getting harassed or bullied , and it gives student enough time to finish before a whole school day is over .

Firstly , allowing students to take online classes from home gives the student the chance to take their time with a subject they might not fully grasps . For example if a student has a hard time understanding the topic or subject he or she is learning, they make take more time then you would regularly in a class worth of time at school.

On the other hand there might be a student that fully understands the concept and glides right through the information and finishes early , but you cannot do that in school because everyone is taught at the same pace .

Secondly, with taking online classes it can prevent students from getting bullied or harassed in school . People may not like to believe students get bullied in school but it happens . From taking these classes you prevent students from getting hurt physically and emotionally . For example , say a kid named Generic_Name goes to school everyday and everyday theirs this bully named Generic_Name that takes his lunch and Generic_Name cannot do anything about it because of his physical attributes but he would not have to encounter Generic_Name if he took online classes .This is just one of many situations where kids get bullied throughout school , but we can prevent actions like those by letting students enroll in classes from home.

Lastly , letting kids take these courses at home give them plenty of time to finish before school hours , because they get to focus on only them selves not other kids . By giving kids the chance to take these classes from home your enabling them to knock out more things on a regular day then they would in a six to seven hour school day . For example , say a student has a doctors appoint at twelve a'clock in the morning by taking these classes from home it gives the student plenty of time to finish there work and make that appointment , but if the student was in school he or she would be missing classes and information that they need . This just goes to show amount of time student have from taking online classes would benefit them extremely on a day to day basis.

In conclusion, people may still believe taking classes from home is point less and a waste of time but by taking these courses from home it can help out students in so many different ways , gives them to chance to learn at there own there rate , protect them from getting made fun of and picked on in school , and even enough time to do day to day activities wihtin a school days worth of time       ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
34F016931102,"Some students would benefit if they understand things easily without a teacher explaining everything and if they don't need help like in math, but other students would not benefit if they don't understand things ,and if they need extra help or ask questions that will be a problem for them taking classes online or video conferencing.

Student who would benefit are those who understand things easily, and if they want to be alone to have a better concentration in what they do classes online is a good option because they will be taking solo training, and it's comfortable to take these classes without going to school they would have more time in home for example, I preferred to take classes online because that will give me more time to prepare everything that I need to go to work, because when I arrive from school to home, I have to do everything really quick ,things that I have to do like wait for my little sister in the bus stop from school then, I have to cook ,and that takes me time, and I have to be ready at 3:30pm to go to my work ,but classes online would benefit me because, I need help understanding classes like geometry or English is not easy for me to understand some words in English, and I need to ask a lot of questions.

Students who would not benefit are those who like to be with friends in school and talk with people that can be an issue for them because taking classes online they will be alone, and they could have some possible technological problems, and if they don't have self-control having a computer in front of them certain time of the day they would not be successful with classes online.

Some people think that students who take classes online don't make the same effort like those who take classes in school , because they don't wake up in the morning to take the school bus like normal high school students do ; however ,I think that students that take classes online male the same effort because they need to have time to take those classes and they have to respect the schedule that teachers give to them to attend class, they have to be in front of the computer a lot of time that can is not good but they do it because they want to graduate like other students wants.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
84EC5D05E3E2,"The ideal setting of education is in a classroom with desks, textbooks, and a chalkboard to write on. Quite frankly, classes may be taught out of this ideal classroom and at a home, with a television and a bed. Although most people may believe televisions and beds are distractions, these objects might just help influence a student's mind into thinking deeper and creatively.

Over 50 years, homeschooling has become an effective method of education. Not only are students allowed access to online learning while in the comfort of their own home, but they are also allowed to work in an independent, comforting environment. A student's environmental standards should be relevantly met in order to provide an adequate performance. Even high school juniors and seniors are provided with the opportunity to take online courses at home. But despite the minor distractions, students benefit from attending classes at home because they have options in managing their schedules, they are in a stress-reduced evironment, and because they do not have to endure obstacles as done in school.

On a daily basis, students do not attend school for various reasons. They either have family emergencies, appointments, or an illness. Often, students take their missed classwork home, to finish on their own time. While only a handful of students make up classroom time, the majority still refuses to complete missed time. For instance, students in my classes reach no credit status and about 1 in 10 of them care to finish their missed work. For this reason, access to learning at home should become an option. This solution will reduce the amount of wasted time for both teachers and students and it will teach students the curriculum.

Aside from time management, students are strongly encouraged to strive and maintain their best efforts; although, this cannot be done in a stressful environment. Home may be considered a soothing, recapaliation location; whereas school is a stress induced setting, where sitting all day is tiring, lectures are given with no breaks, and students are uneasy. Classwork is given consequetively causing the brain to slow down its production. Meanwhile at home, students may choose their own pace to learn at and take breaks when needed. The stress at school not only reflects a negative environment, but it also affects the children and students from learning effectively. Based off my experience, I can declare that my mind flows better at home than it does in school. In English class I cannot seem to concetrate when writing the journals of the day. While at home, my thoughts flow like a stream. The prior classes replaced my energy with stress, destroying my brain's ability to function. Because of stress in school, classes should be accessed at home.

In addition to the benefits of time management and a stress-reduced environment from courses at home, students are additionally eliminated from the obstacles endured in school. Waking up for school five days a week, at 5 a. m. is a challenge. Some teenagers, such as myself, are sleep deprived for righteous reasons: working late and completing homework or projects. Others have to do both, once in a while. But learning at home can give students an opportunity to get enough rest to get their work completed. Furthermore, some days at school are not spent learning. Instead, they are spent out of class because of school cancellations due to incliment weather, out-of-school suspensions, in-school-suspensions, or in the administrators office, getting disciplined for a violation of the dress code. Valuable instructional time is lost, whereas online education works around these obstacles. As a matter of fact, none of these factors are of importance when one is attending school from home. The minor, problematic situations at school are what make classes from home more beneficial.

Overall, classes from home take a stronger position when compared to taking classes at school. Unlike problems from at-school learning, students are exposed to beneficial learning at home by flexible schedules, a stress-reduced environment, and a reduced risk of obstacles. Though it may not seem as a good idea at a first glance, these reasons could be postive aspects to why students would benefit from attending classes at home. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
46284DF2F31C,"Online schooling and video conferencing have become more popular lately, so popular that many more schools offer it than before. Even colleges offer online classes. This type of schooling has both pros and cons but, I think that students would benefit from classes at home, more than it would hurt a students academic career. The benefits of students would be not having to miss as many lessons because they are sick, no one around them so they have less distraction from other people, and it is not as stressful because the students can work at their own pace.

Students becoming sick throughout the year is very common, but if they took online classes or had video conferences the days of sick students missing a lesson would decrease. For example, a student caught mono, which is very contagious at first, had to stay home for almost a month. As a result, he missed a lot of classes with important lessons and it became very hard for him to try and catch up again. If he was offered online school or video conferencing he would not have been as far behind from his classmates. Trying to catch up with all the school work out missed can put more stress on the student which can cause them to become sick again and miss even more school. Students who are healthier leads to being happier which can lead to better academics because the students want to try their best instead of wanting to give up. Which is why more schools should offer online classes or video conferencing.

The classroom is full of distractions, especially from your friends and classmates. For example, many students talk throughout every class and do not talk about anything relative to what they are learning. Which causes the students around them to start talking and get off topic. When one student stop focusing everyone stops focusing, causing no one to retain any of the information given. Having online school or video conferencing could help because the students would not just follow what their peers do, they would have to follow what they know they should do. It also could benefit students because since they do not have friends to talk to they can finally stayed focus on the work. Short breaks are good but when students are around their friends it gets out of hand and many students take breaks for almost the whole class period.

The last reason why it would benefit students is because it is not as stressful. For example, students stress out because they were given so many assignments all from different classes at one time with less than a week for all the due dates. With online or video conferencing students have more time to finish the assignments and can do the work the pace they set. As a result, students become less stressed and more relaxed with the same amount of work as other students. Students who can work at their own pace are healthier and happier than people who have little time to finish an assignment, because they know the assignment will be done but they do not have to worry or stress about it all the time. The less stress students have the better they are able to think and preform academically because they are able to focus on one thing and not worry about ten other things for different classes.

Online school and video conferencing could hep students who become sick and have to miss multiple days of school, there is also less distraction from other people, and students can work slower if they need more time for the work. Ultimately, students enrolled in online school or video conferencing could benefit the students in multiple ways. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F7C142237DA8,"The Reality of Distance Learning

Have you ever taken the time to consider how much technology dominates our daily lives. The worldwide increase in technological advancements have changed people's lives drastically in the past few decades. Like almost all other aspects of society, the education system was also majorly affected by this spur of innovations across the globe. Online resources such as e-textbooks and file sharing has made it possible to replace almost all physical assignments in our school system. While some technological advances do make education much easier and efficient, this doesn't mean doing everything regarding schoolwork online is a good idea. Schools are starting to offer distance learning as an option for students to work from home through online conferences and tools. This may seem very beneficial at first, however, distance learning has certain negative aspects that should not be overlooked. Being able to attend classes from home would not be beneficial to students because this will cause a decrease in student productivity, increase chances of cheating among students, and deprive students of the discipline and social skills that a regular school environment teaches.

Students are scientifically proven to be more productive while working in places they associate with said work. A regular school environment helps students be more productive by eliminating outside distractions and helping students focus better on their work. These are conditions that simply cannot be replicated in a house environment for the student. A house is associated with relaxation, sleep, safety, and nourishment. Being in an environment like this simply doesn't help students be productive and focus. An example to this is my uncle who works in the I.T field. He used to work from home for a long time, giving advice to companies about their online systems and programs. He switched to working in an office two years ago and saw a major increase in his productivity. He said having a designated place to work helps get in a working mindset which directly translates to more work being done. The working environment a school provides for its students is an essential part of education and shouldn't be eliminated through distance learning.

Cheating and plagiarism are major issues that are being fought against all over the country. Every school district wants to combat cases of cheating as much as they can. Many guidelines and regulations are put in place in an attempt to end this widespread phenomenon. However, offering students to attend classes from home goes against everything that's being done in order to prevent cheating. Without a teacher to supervise them, students who work from home will be much more prone to cheating on test or other assignment, which would give them an unfair edge on their peers. Last year, my math teacher gave us a take-home quiz. Her goal in doing so was to give us more time to work on it so we can work at our own pace. She did this in order for us to be more successful on the test. At first glance, it seemed like her plan was working since everyone in the class got very good scores on said assignment. However, we later found out that most people were looking up the answers online when the class average for the real test came out to be unexpectedly low. In a case like this, having students take the quiz assignment in class would've led them to actually learn the material instead of searching the answers up online and taking the easy way out. Most students don't put an effort to seeking out ways to cheat, but when given an easy opportunity, most of them will be prone to do so instead of trying to challenge themselves.

Along with all the academic advantages schools have over distance learning, they also provide a social environment that school age students need to be exposed to in order to develop necessary social skills. A school is the best place for students to make lifelong friends, share memorable moments with people, and go through so many more social experiences that will prepare them for adulthood. A friend of mine, who was home schooled until ninth grade, always talks about how much better a real school environment is compared to being educated at home. Because of this, he's very socially awkward and anxious around people. A distance learning program, where the student can stay home all day and isn't encouraged to go outside and socialize, is destined to result in students suffering from similar consequences.

In conclusion, technology has been useful in many aspects of our education system. This, however, doesn't mean our education should be completely dominated by technology. Schools offering students a distance learning option where they can study from home results in many problems such as lowering students' work productivity, and having them be more inclined towards cheating. On top of this, distance learning eliminates the advantages of a school environment such as providing better focus and teaching students necessary social and disciplinary skills. The distance learning option may seem like a decent idea at first glance, but in its roots lie many problems that would have to be solved in order to make it beneficial.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
126AB089D089,"There is an ongoing debate regarding distance learning for students. Many people say distance learning is a better option for some students rather than being in regular school. Others say that students that do distance learning may play around at home and not complete their work. For some that might be the case, but not all students are like that. Some students need distance learning because it can make school work easier to understand, they won't get picked on by other students, and the school work won't pile up if they're sick and have to miss a few days.

First, doing distance learning is good because it can make the school work easier to understand for the student. Some students take longer to understand new units than others. In regular school, the teacher isn't going to keep going over the subject until one student finally understands it. Distance learning creates one on one time with your teacher and makes it easier to learn something new. If you're struggling with something you can ask to video call and have them explain it in a way that makes it easy for you to understand. You also won't have to worry about the teacher getting distracted by other students, like in a class room. The teacher will be available for questions at almost any time you need help.

Next, doing distance learning has the benefit of not getting picked on by other students. Some students are a big target for bullies. When some students don't understand something, others like to make rude remarks to them. With distance learning you won't have that problem. Eighty-seven percent of students polled reported that they've been bullied before at school. Bullying can make students with depression and anxiety not want to go to school at all or even cause suicidal thoughts. Constant bullying can also cause students to not try in school and give up because of others bringing them down all the time. Students won't have to worry about this during distance learning online classes. They can be themselves with no judgment.

Lastly, distance learning makes it to where even if you're sick, you can still learn. Tons of students get sick each year around the same time and miss a few days of school. Those students understand how much work you really miss when you're sick, especially if you're in high school. One day of missed work feels like It's a never ending pile. On top of that if you miss a day when you're learning something new, you might never fully understand it. Online schooling makes it to where you can do your school work almost anywhere at any time. While sick or even in on a road trip, you can easily do your school work by the click of a button.

In conclusion, there are many benefits to why students should have the option to do distance learning and attend their classes at home. They understand their work easier, won't have bullies that add unwanted stress, and won't have piles of work waiting for them when they're out for a few days. Students will have less stress in general and be a lot happier with themselves. They will also have more time to spend with their family and friends. Distance learning also allows for students to do more fun things outside of school and be able to take ""school"" anywhere they go without becoming behind.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0B720B5EA0E9,"There students that would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because there schools that can let you take online classes. You are able to work on your own pace,you are also able to balance school,work and spending time with friends and families,and your able to take video conferencing at home.

There are many different schools that can let you take online classes. There students going through family issues at home that they aren't able to attend school regularly. It can help them to learn in class so they don't fall behind or fail the grade. They just want to learn like us and have a great future. It can also help if you are attending collage but not want to stay on campus.

When having the benefit to take online class at home is working at your own pace. You are working at your own pace to get in done fast or you just like to take your time. Many students prefer taking their time becasue it will help them understand it more then rushing the working knowing that it could be wrong. It can also help them be more then the other colleagues at school. When having this opportunity your able to get work done without any distractions.

When balacing school,working and spending time with family and friends can be very diffcult at times if you are attending school regularly but when taking online classes it can help you understand the class more and you can focus more then getting distracted at school because of friends. This will help you get the work done in matter of seconds.

When having the intrenet your able to do may things but having the opportunity to a video conference from home while still attending school is the best. This will help you with one on one tutoring sessions to ask questions to your teacher or professor when having trouble with anything in a subject. You are also able to learn new things while doing video conference.

Students should take this opportunity to attend school from home because instead of going to school for seven to eight hours, you can learn everything at home without anyone rushing you or having a deadline when its due. Its better to take your time and take the opportunity. I would recommed this to anyone who would rather get to learn at home on their own.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BF17866F7014,"Some schools offer online classes from home as an alternative to going to a classroom. In no way, shape, or form does this benefit a student. Online classes are made for students who may not be in the same state or country, not for local students who can walk to school and sit in the classroom. Online classes takes students away from the physical interaction of being in a classroom with others, creates more introverts who do not or would not know how to socialize with the outside world, and also makes it a lot harder to grasps some concepts via a screen.

First and for most, students need physical interaction of some kind. Most students only get the chance to interact or meet others through school. Physical interaction through school gives students social skills that they need and will use for the rest of their lives. Not only does it give them needed social skills, but gives them a template of how the real world is and prepares them for it.

In addition, some students need a one on one learning session with a teacher. If they were looking at their teacher through a screen it would be a lot harder for them to get that one on one that they need. Other students do not learn visually like others might; this makes it unfair to those students who need that classroom setting. This also makes it harder to ask questions. When someone is confused it is a lot harder to depict what they are really trying to tell you through a screen. Not only does this make it harder on the student but the teacher as well;

it causes the teacher to struggle in understanding what their student is trying to ask or explain.

However, some argue that online classes are beneficial for students. Many people believe that having online classes helps by eliminating causes of spreading sickness, bullying, and even being late to school. Yet, some things are inevitable, no matter where you go all of those things are possible. Having online classes requires you to log in, this causes a problem because they may forget to log in or may not log in on purpose. You can catch an illness by just laying in bed, having online school does not stop the spread of sickness but just slows it down. Bullying happens in our daily life, having it happen to a student helps him or her learn how to deal with it.

Having online school would not and does not benefit a student at all. It creates a bigger struggle for them and the teacher. It takes students away from being able to make new friends and learn efficiently. A classrooms gives students the one on one help they need and shows them how to deal with the real world.

Not only that, it creates extroverts and problem solvers. That is why online schools are not beneficial to students.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3DAE21FF789C,"Several schools offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Many people may believe that this strategy is beneficial to modern day society, but the idea comes with many flaws. With this being said, students would not benefit from being able to take online classes at home, proving that students would miss out on valuable social and educational experiences.

Students would not benefit from beig able to take online classes at home because their social skills would not develop properly. Being in an educational environmnet allows students to interact with one and other on the daily. With out this advantage, students would not be able to collabrate and make connections to others work and assignments. This, believe it or not, plays a huge role in how students in todays generation learn and grow as individuals. If a student is trapped behind a screen every day without socializing with others, the student will eventually become very shy and unable to socialize with not only students, but adults as well. As young adults grow, a major part of maturing is developing a character, and being able to hold a conversation. Therefore, online classes at home would not be beneficial due to the lack of social oppertunities and collabration among other students.

Not only would students social skills not develop properly, students would not benefit from being able to take online classes at home because they would miss out school experiences. One of the best parts of attending school is the ""school spirit"" events that come along with it. Some of the most memorable times of a students life takes place in school. For example, two major events that occur during this time are prom and homecoming. Prom and homecoming are both two once in a life time events that take place during gradeschool. These events allow students and fellow classmates to come together to socialize, dance, and dress up in their nicest attire. Also, many schools have spirit weeks and pep rallys during this time. These too, are events taken place at school where students are able to show off their spirit for their school while dressing up in overwhelming outfits corresponding with that days theme. Another opportunity that students are able to experience are highschool sports. Whether students are playing in the games themselves or watching from the sidelines in the student section, students are able to develope life long memories by socializing with friends, dressing up to the football theme, and cheering on their school. With this said, oline classes at home are not nearly as beneficial as attending school due to the fact that students are able to experience life long memories while attending school.

To add on to missing out on experiences, students would not benefit from being able to take classes online at home because it is easier for students to slack off on their work and not pay attention. When students attend school, they are taught by an adult who is always keeping the student on track and focused on their work. While being at home, it is way easier for students to zone off and slack off on their work. A lot of the time, students will put off work since their is no teacher assigning them harsh deadlines. It takes a huge responsibility that many students at this age have not yet developed. This issue alone can affect a students education tremendously. This meaning, online classes at home are not nearly as beneficial due to the huge responsibilty it holds for a students education.

Many people believe that online school gives students more time for other outside of school activities. While this claim may be accurate in some cases, the majority of students that take online classes at home actually end up using their extra time very poorly. Students, again, tend to zone off fairly quickly with out structured direction. Also, with this extra time students are given, they tend to use it to their own advantage rather then their educational advantage. In other words, students that know that they can finsih their online class on a seperate day at home may get in a bad habbit of putting of work. This can later cause their education to plummit tremendously. Therefore, online classes at home are not nearly as beneficial due to the fact that students could take advantage of the extra time they are given.

The idea of granting students with the oportunity to take classes online at home is very poor and weak. This idea of distant learning will only harm students education in the near future. Students who end up taking online classes at home will eventually miss out on developing their social skills and damage their ability to take on responsibilites. Students will also miss out on once in a life time memories that are taken place in school. With all this said, students would not benefit from being able to take classes online.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

3FEA65A1F11E,"Many students face the issue of having a disability and do not get the help they need from their schools. This is clearly an issue as schools are not letting these students work to their full potential, and can lead to problems for the students later on in life such as; getting into college or getting a job. Allowing students with certain cases the choice to stay home and learn can be a great way to help them. Giving students with disabilities extra help does not make it unfair for other students; as those with disabilities do not have the natural advantage those students have. The category 'disability' does not just include learning disabilities, it includes those with mental illnesses and physical disabilities along with other medical issues.

Attending classes from home would be a great way to help students who have learning disabilities. People with learning disabilities often need extra help and learning at home is a great way to give them that. Online schooling can provide students with the ability to work at their own pace and allows students to receive one on one assistance from their teachers without taking attention away from the rest of the class. Students can also take extra classes to help if needed without having to worry about taking too much time out of the school day. This can also provide care that makes the students feel no different from their classmates; which is what most students really want.

Another way taking classes from home can benefit students is by helping those with mental illnesses. Most teenagers face the issue of having Anxiety, Depression, or ADHD, and being away from the school while still learning for a temporary amount of time might be a great way to resolve the stress school can cause for those students. Students often feel the most stress from other students, and being away from the crowded classrooms and halls can be a great way for the people to take a break. Having a mental illness can really impact how well the students can do in school. Stress, tiredness, and the in-ability to focus can all affect how well we can perform in school and in social situations, and all of these are some of the most common symptoms a mental illness.

The final way that taking classes at home is for those with physical disabilities such as those in need of a wheel chair or in need of medical care. Allowing the students to stay at home for classes would allow the students to learn without the fear of disrupting the classroom. This would also take the stress away from parents and teachers of a medical emergency occurring at the school that they cannot help. The parents will be able to keep an eye on what goes on through out the day concerning their child. Having medications at school can also be a hassle; having to leave the classroom whenever you need them which causes a disruption to the lesson. Staying at home allows the student to take medications as needed without having to ask to go to the nurse first or, just sneaking medications in classes which can be a medical hazard.

Though some people believe that allowing kids to stay home and do school work is not a great way to handle problems as they may become lazy and not do their work. Taking school classes at home will not benefit some people, though it can help those with different cases and should be available for those who need it. Not every student is the same and will have different needs for social situations and learning. Taking away a method that may help some just because it won't benefit all can damage those minorities chances to succeed.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3DAC64829E27,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attent classes from home?

on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowdays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, they would not like to have to hear more stuff that has to do with school . besides some people are more smart and they could take the class just to see how thats going to help, but sometimes people dont try the stuff and thats why, they never know if they are going to like it or not.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online video conferencing

I think, students are not going to have any benefit to attent classes from home. some of the studends have to work, do stuff at home, or stay in school on other activities. students sometimes, actually need some help with some classes but they might not like to be taking the classes at home, The studend taking the class at home could get distracted by so many things at his house. While some other studends that have better grades and like school they could take the class, but they also will have homework and things to do at home.

Students would not get any benefits by taking classes at home because, the online class could be also start teaching the same work that the teacher already teach you, or either the online class could be teaching different ways how to solve a problem that the student will get very stressed and after that its not going to be able to learn something from it and instead helping the student the online class is going to make it more difficult.",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2
9F93DDF89408,"A student decides to work from home. They open their computer and log on to their class. The student listens to the conference, but they aren't fully paying attention. Instead their attention is slightly directed to a TV which is playing softly in the background. The student ends up failing all because they were distracted. That's why I believe that students wouldn't benefit from attending classes while at home because of increased distractions and lack of teacher presence.

Being at home while attending classes could cause distractions and hinder a student's performance. When at home people become relaxed and more inclined to do things that they want to do, pushing other things like work and school out of their minds. Meaning, students would be distracted by those wants, such as, watching TV and playing games, and wouldn't be interested in doing school work.

Attending online classes at home means that there isn't a teacher there, in person, to help you. Having a video conference with a teacher is completely different from being in a classroom with one. Making it harder for people to understand what's being taught to them. Taking a class like math online would be difficult for the students who take longer to understand certain problems. Sometimes they need the teacher to explain a problem in multiple ways before they can understand it. Being online, where it's harder to communicate, would definitely make the information harder to understand.

Taking classes from home could encourage independence in students, however, I believe that is wrong because some students would take advantage of that opportunity. Students would take the chance of learning from home as an excuse to stay at home just because they don't want to go to school. Also, students could take advantage of a teacher not being there to watch them and use that to cheat. Since most parents aren't going to meticulously watch students and teachers have a restricted field of vision because of computer cameras, taking classes from home give students more opportunities to take advantage, and could negatively effect how they learn.

Though, some people may think that taking classes from home would be beneficial to students because of things like encouraging independence. I believe otherwise, because of increased distraction, lack of teacher presence, and the possibility of students taking advantage of being at home while taking classes. That's why students should continue to take classes at school and shouldn't take online classes at home unless it is absolutely necessary.             ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D0179FB2F5C4,"Have you ever wondered what it's like to attend school without actually leaving your house? It seems that nowadays, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This may either be a temporary or permanent way of learning, depending on the case of the school and student. Although many people may view this distance learning opportunity as a good thing, I see it as negative to the learning experience. I do not think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because the bond between teachers and students would be lost, cheating would become far more easy for students to accomplish, and students may be too easily distracted in a more familiar and comfortable environment.

In school, teachers are able to test the knowledge of students by giving them assignments and checking them, however, with online classes it is impossible for a teacher to know and understand if a student is learning. There also seems to be a bond that is broken between students and teachers, as teachers can help with more than just schoolwork. Not only do students lose the opportunity to address questions in person but they also lose someone they can talk to if they need help in their lives. Although at times it may not seem like the bond between teachers and students is one that can be important in a students life, certain teachers may be people who students are able to look up to and are inspired by to continue putting effort into their work now, as well as in the future. Without actually ever seeing your teacher, a student may forget why they are doing the work they do, as they may prefer to begin doing something else that they believe will benefit them more, for example, focusing more on their chores at home rather than their schoolwork. It seems that a certain part of effort in school comes from the student wanting to make a teacher proud and with introducing online classes, not only is the bond between teachers and students broken, students do not have a reason for submitting hard work to a teacher they have never met in person.

Another reason why I believe students are not benefiting from online classes at home is because cheating becomes a lot easier for students to achieve. For example, in school a teacher will often collect students' phones and place dividers between them before tests and quizzes in order to limit cheating. If a test is online, a teacher will often check a student's online web history to make sure they did not open other tabs during the time of the exam. If a student is learning from home, what is stopping them from opening another tab online and finding every single answer to a test or quiz? When there is no limit to how a student can use the internet from their home, they could use it to cheat by doing many things like looking up answers as well as sharing answers with friends in the same class; furthermore, students learn less from home as when students cheat on exams, it shows that they did not necessarily learn anything beforehand and they do not learn anything while taking the test as all of the answers can simply be looked up.

Also, you cannot expect that students will care to remember the answers to the questions they happened to search.

As for the schools that do partake in online classes from home, I am sure that the students are still able to benefit in some way. Students may prefer to learn in an environment that is more comfortable and accessible to them and also learn in an environment where they do not have to live in constant fear of being wrong or bullied. Students may also be happier in the comfort of their own home, as it seems that many students who must wake up with the purpose of going to school are not motivated or prepared to learn, possibly due to the environment of certain schools. However, there still remains the case that students will become distracted too easily and will begin to focus on other things besides school. Students learning from home could also have a hard time not entertaining themselves by playing video games, watching movies, or even inviting friends over. Students may feel happier and safer in their homes, although the amount of distractions that are offered will cause a student's focus to eventually stretch away from school and the student will become less and less knowledgeable.

In conclusion, it seems that with the introduction of online classes in schools, there happens to be another way of learning that is offered. However, I do not see this way of learning as beneficial as it causes students to put less effort into their work and education. Students will not only have a hard time finding motivation to work, but will also learn less in general. Overall, this lack of effort can be exemplified by the fact that a student does not receive any motivation to learn or advice from a teacher, it is easier for students to cheat in ways such as looking up answers or sharing answers as no internet regulations are placed on them like they would be on an exam during school, and students are easily distracted at home, whether it is through their television or games. I do believe that one day, all schools may offer online classes, however, by then I hope there is a way to further motivate students, as well as more regulations placed on their online home learning experience.                   ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
3AE58AC9DFC2,"In person teaching vs online teaching has been a very controversial topic for a very long time. While the majority supports online teaching, there are still some that support the idea of attending in person. Attending classes physically may yield some benefits that online classes don't, however, online teaching creates more rewards by enabling the student to adjust the class session according to the schedule, saving a lot of time that would otherwise be wasted, and providing for a stress free experience.

The student can decide which time would be the best for them to attend the class, whether it be in the morning or in the afternoon. They'll be able to attend the class without having to cancel or reschedule anything. For me, this is quite valuable. I strongly dislike waking up really early in the morning, at the crack of dawn, just so I can be ready for school. With this feature, I can attend my class and get all the rest I need.

Saving time could make all the difference to a student. The time that would normally be wasted trying to catch a bus, finding a parking, avoid or getting through traffic, and the sort can now be spent sitting on the couch in pajamas and eating breakfast, all while attending the very same class that could've been missed otherwise. I sometimes struggle in the morning to prepare myself and my stuff as to not miss the bus, and in turn, be late for school. This is another advantage of having online classes that would make my life, and everyone else's, so much easier.

A stress free education would make the whole experience a lot easier on all students. There is simply too much time being wasted trying to understand a difficult topic with limited resources, and in a limited time. Being able to have one on one sessions with the teacher would allow students to ask additional questions and get extra help on homework and other assignments. Whenever I have trouble do an assignment, I find that asking for help from a teacher, or anyone with experience on the topic, allows me to better understand what it is I'm doing and have an easier time completing the designated assignment.

Online class have their flaws too. For instance, the software that's being used could experience a malfunction, or there could even be too many students already in the session. There could also be a predetermined schedule that does not fit the student's personal timetable, resulting in them missing the set time of the session or them moving another event to a later date. Though some would say that attending class in person is more beneficial, because of the many complications of online teaching, such as having a hard time finding, managing, or even navigating the website or software, online teaching is simply more convenient because it saves time, allows the student to choose which session to attend according the their personal agenda, and provides all students with stress free learning experience.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
53B68DAFE78B,"""Alright class now here is where you need to pay attention...,"" and the screen goes black, not to mention the only thing written in big, bold letters is the word Rebooting, planted right in the center of your once lit up screen. Online classes seem like fun at first, you get to stay home, relax and work at your own pace, until they're not. In fact online classes can bring many issues that can not only affect you majorly in the academic world but also in your mental world. The idea that students can benefit more from taking at home classes is invalid; due to students being at a bigger disadvantage than those at school and the fact that online classes can lead to overall mental health issues.

Although students taking classes at home are in a more comfortable environment than those at school, they're continuously put at a disadvantage from those who are able to receive more help at school. As understanding as it is, wanting to be in a comfortable position while tons of different information is shoved inside your brain, online students find themselves struggling to understand what is being taught to them at least 50% of the time. While students located in schools have the opportunity to ask for assistance in any subject needed by teachers, those at home are not as lucky to have teachers at home who take the time to slowly break down information for students until it fits their understanding. Struggles in comprehending subjects leads to overall, no further progress for online students who than must try and catch up to those already a subject ahead of them. Another disadvantage for students at home is the fact that they dont receive as much mental support as those in schools. For example, teachers motivate students to complete work continuously, or to do well in classes and tests all the time; students at home don't receive that support which means they dont feel motivated enough to pass tests or complete work, which than leads to failing grades and failure to turn in work. In my school my English teacher tells us a phrase that not only motivates me everyday, but encourages the idea that its okay to fail because you just have fight harder to pass in the next attempt. Or as she says,"" the first step of passing is to fail,"" thats the type of motivation that kids at home need. Though staying home while receiving an education sounds fantastic, understanding that a student will always be at a disadvantage from those at school is not, because wanting to be comfortable is not a good enough reason for falling behind.

Additionally, students taking at home classes can also be at risk of suffering through many mental health issues in the future. Normally, when a student struggles to comprehend materials they tend to get very frustrated with not only themselves but with everything around them. Later on those frustrations turn into big ball of stress. The Stress of falling behind, stress of trying to catch up, and finally, stress of not being able to understand. Eventually, that frustration and that stress, just keep building up until, one day, one just can't take it anymore,and they pop. While being in that terrible phase the anxiety monster finds that moment of weakness as an opportunity and decides to take over the students subconscious, all because at home students, as previously stated, have harder times comprehending subjects than those at school. So, we have anxiety, we got frustration, and we have some stress going around,that should be it right? Wrong, because theres is one more mental health issue that at home students are at risk of getting that not only controls a small part of the body but at least the majority of it. Ladies and gentleman, please welcome Mr. Depression to the list of mental health issues to the table. Although depression seems unlikely for students at school to get, it is actually very possible for those students at home to obtain. In school many students go through many interactions daily; whether it be talking to friends at lunch, or talking to a teacher for help, even talking to the principle when your in trouble is a daily interaction that school students go through. on the other hand, students at home dont have many interactions daily as those in school, they dont have friends to sit with at lunch or teachers to help them with work or even a principle to yell at them when they break dress code, it's just them. Eventually they will start feeling that emotion of isolation and once its there it wont go away, than that feeling of being alone well become permanent and the depression beings. Overall students at home are at bigger risk of going through many mental health issues than those in school.

However, objectors may argue that at home education encourages students to take on, and later gain, more responsibility. At home education allows students to do work at their own pace, but the student must be responsible enough to work as hard as ever to make progress. Another way students at home have more responsibility is because, if they dont understand subjects fully, it is up to them and only them to look up additional information to help them get that full comprehension. Additionally, they must stay on top of classes and work by their own will, because nobody will be there to push them to do their work besides themselves. Although at home classes can bring upon many issues for a student. they do have the opportunity to gain much responsibility, and eventually, mature.

In conclusion online classes may seem like a good idea at first, but can later be the worst decision you could ever make. online classes bring many disadvantages towards students both phiscally and mentally. They also bring on many mental health issues like stress and depression. Overall, the idea that students benefit more from taking online classes is false because, they bring students to a bigger disadvantage and the affect scholars with many mental health issues in later life.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

i think that yes if they put their mind to it. And i think if they want to pass all their grades if they are doing school at home and they really want to do it then yes If they do the all their sentens well and all their paragh well.

Aslo i think that if they are home schooled that they might do the work when they want to do it some of them will not care about it and some might just forgetand outher will say they will do it latter.

Sometime the mom/dad dose not help the student but most of the time the student want to do home school and want to pass then yes it depends on the student. when any student dose school at home they will often not do the work they aslo dont learn all the things the the school teaches they learn what the mom/dad knows.

I will say i suport it but i also dont suport becuas like i said most kids dont do the work but also some do the work. most kids when they are home schooled the mom/dad send them to school becuas they dont know what elas to teach them some just do it just to get school over with and when the mom/dad send them to school they some times llike but they aslo end up droping out of school.

Most student do benift from atending class at home but if they put their mind to it and do the work some time they learn like that becuas theirs no one that bothers them they do the work at their own speed on what they know.

most student come to school when they are home school they dont know most of the things that they learning that is becuas they didn't learn much when they where atending the class at home online becuas they were offten on their phone most of the time not caring about the work, or becuas they sleep late. Some student do know more when they are home schooled some times more then what they a student that gose to public school.

but most students that are home school they some times want to go to public school they want to go beacus they want to learn more thing make frend they rather go to public school to learn more beacuas they benn doing home school for most of the school year. some time its beacuas of their mom/dad scared that some thing might happen to their kid they dont trust their kid going to public school beacuas they might do some bad thiing.

im sure that students benefitfrom home school some take colleg class at home some start their corears but taking online class at home or some just do the things/follow the step their perent.

sometime when they are home schooled they have to go to school beacuas they have family problems or beacuas they just dont like being home scholled no more beacuas they want to do more things they wan tot learn more beacuas they feel like they are not learing the thing that they are learnig at home.

The things they learn some times aint right if they are learnig it frome their mom/dad if they are not doing the class online.

712C7781C2D9,"In America today many students are now doing online schooling. These students do school on their computers which requires an obtuse amount of reading. Students do their work online while often times attending video conferences. A handful of parents believe getting an education online is not giving their children what they need to get a full education. They believe there is nothing to gain from online school that you won't get from public school. But many disagree with that sentiment. Is public school really ultimately the best option for students?

Many americans currently struggle everyday with health problems. This can make things hard as resources are limited and some things might not be as accessible for some individuals. People with hypothyroidism often times have difficulty focusing. This can be especially difficult for students as a teacher may give directions and the student could easily miss them. Individuals who have hypothyroidism often times have what's nick named the thyroid stare. They space out and become unaware of their surroundings, including the teacher talking. Another symptom of hypothyroidism is confusion. Students could forget where things are and forget directions even when they hear them. With online classes, directions are often written out or replayable. One could replay directions as much as they needed to without having a teacher get frustrated with them. This makes the problems that many who suffer from hypothyroidism face much more managable.

Not only can online school benefit people with hypothyroidism but also people struggling with ADHD. ADHD can effect someones ability to focus in a classroom setting. A student may get distracted and miss the directions a teacher is giving. A student may also end up missing important announcements. People with ADHD struggle to stay silent and sit still for long periods of time. They need some form of an outlet to let the energy they build up out. Doing school work at home could give an individual with ADHD an outlet to let out energy by giving them breaks inbetween classes. A student could use the break to run outside or do a physical activity. Once they get back from taking a break they will be calmer and more focused.

Individuals who have disabilities that greatly impact their ability to move and walk could find that online schooling could make learning a lot easier for them. If a person is Immobile, getting to school every day could be a great struggle. Most parents would want to do every thing to make it easier for them; one way to do that is with online schooling. You do not have to go anywhere to do online classes as you can do them all at home. If a person is particularly sensitive and stuck in the hospital 24/7, they could have a chance to do school through online classes. They too have a right to an education.

Students with mental health problems could improve their quality of education through online schooling.

Students with anxiety often have difficulty being in social situations. Anxiety varies person to person and for some individuals it can be worse than others. Some people have anxiety so severe it renders them unable to speak. A school environment, where most other students are constantly assuming everyone they meet can speak, could cause the student a great amount of stress. Transgender people often struggle with a lot of anxiety in school day to day. Many are too anxious to use the bathrooms at schools and hold it in for the whole day. Many are often also misgendered at school every day which induces a lot of stress for trans people, however, All of this added stress can be avoided with online school. There are no students to misgender trans students or to assume students are able to speak. Transgender Students can go to the bathroom at home without being stress.

One thing that effects teenagers today the most is depression. Depression effects an abundance of students on a day to day basis. For some individuals it can come and go but for some it can last longer. Some students have it for weeks and some for even longer. The people who suffer from it the longest are chronically depressed. Depression can make someone unable to get out of bed in the morning. It can make an individual see trying to get an education as pointless and make them stop caring about their future. Being able to do school online can't fix everything for a student struggling with depression, but it can make things easier.

Online classes make it so a student struggling with depression won't have to juggle going to school with getting out of bed in the morning. They can do school work later in the day or even in bed. When they do online classes they will have a greater chance of missing less school and have easier access to making up work when they couldn't do school.

There may be people who disagree but in all honestly, almost anyone can get atleast something out of online schooling. Wether it is students struggling with mental and physical health problems or just average students. The flexibility and accessability of online schooling can make getting an education not as difficult as it needs to be. Being able to do school online should always be an option for anyone who wishes to do it.       ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0DD93F825FD7,"The education system is always trying to find new ways to improve the how kids learn and how efficiently the kids learn. With the evolution of technology, it has given the education system new ways to improve how students learn and interact with their teachers or professors on a day to day basis. Schools are now beginning to teach classes online to students and it may be more beneficial the one may think. Students can heavily benefit from online learning and attending classes from because, it can help students focus more on their learning, it can allow teachers to be more available for their students, and it can help those that dont live close enough to an actual school still get an education.

Online classes and learning from home can help students focus and buckle down on their education. For example, Generic_Name is a Junior in high school which means its an important year for her to be focused on her classes and how she is doing in them. But, Generic_Name has just gone through a break up with her boyfriend and had issues with some of her friends. Its now all that can think about and her mind starts to drift when ever she is in class which is affecting her grades. Students in school deal with drama on a day to day basis and it can affect them to the point that they arent focused on their classes at all. The only thing they think and talk about is whatever drama is going on in their social life. When they are being taught at home, they do not have to worry about whatever someone else is doing because they are in their own home one on one with a teacher which will allow them to be more focused at the task at hand which is their education. Another way online education can help kids focus is, if the have any issues in dealing with people. Generic_Name has severe social anxiety and suffers from panic attacks and shakiness whenever she as around too many people that she does not know. She can not focus in class because she is to busy dealing with how she feels about the pressure from being in school and being around a lot of people can be a detriment to her education. There are many people who deal with social anxiety or other social disabilities. With online at home classes it can prevent any social issues and help those kids focus. Overall, students being focused is one of the main keys to getting a proper education and anyway to improve that and prevent a loss of focus is a good thing.

Attending classes from home can also allow teachers to be more available to their students and can be there for students based on the students schedule. Generic_Name Plays basketball for a travel league and they practice everyday from 3pm-5pm so as soon as school ends for him he has to go home get dressed and start making his way to the location of his practice. But if he needed help on a topic that he did not understand in class then he can not necessarily stay after school to ask a teacher a question or get extra help. In an online school system teachers can be available for help at basically anytime if a student needs to have a conference or video call with them. They do what they can based around a students schedule so that they can better help the student. Another way online school allows teachers to be more available is when, a student may need help while studying late night. Sometimes they run into questions on homework or other practices given to them that they struggle to understand. Teachers can take the time to help them understand so that they can feel confident in their answers. Teachers in online school compared to normal school provide a lot more availability to their students which can be beneficial any many situations students go through outside of their education.

Lastly, online school from home can be beneficial to those that miss school for reasons such as being sick or traveling. Generic_Name had to miss several days of school because he got had a really bad fever and while he was gone his teacher had already gone through a whole unit of material that will be difficult to catch up on. If was doing online school he could take the classes while sick because he'll still be at his house. Therefore, he will not have to play catch up on any assignments or notes he missed. He will have them all at the click of a mouse and hes at the same pace as everyone else. Another example is how you can still take all your classes while on a trip. Generic_Name had to go go Florida to visit her grandmother for her birthday but she left on Thursday. While she was away she missed a test and 2 quizzes from her classes that she will have to make up when she gets back to school. This means she will stress out about the material that will be on said tests and quizzes while trying to be on vacation with her family and she may even forget to study for it at all. With the easy accessibility of online classes students can take tests or quizzes on the go while they are traveling. Even if they forget to take it while traveling the can study with the notes and topics they already received from online sessions so students do not also have to worry about bringing study materials with them. The flexibility with online classes to help kids learn no matter where they are is surely an advantage and a benefit to all students.

Many people may argue that online school could be too lenient for students and will not emphasize deadlines, can teach kids the same social skills that being in an actual school would, or that online school doesnt place as many responsibilities on students as normal schools. Online classes can make eliminate distractions making it easier to focus, give students more opportunities to get help form teachers, and help out those who may be sick travel when there are important things going on. Over all online classes at home give the same information and teach the same curriculum as normal public schools with giving added benefit of flexibility. This could be the new standard for how classes are taught in the world today.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

As we progress into an advanced, modernized, and technological world, the need for attending schools and jobs becomes questionable. New technology has allowed for the ability to work from home through online resources. Due to these advancements, the advantage of students being able to attend schools from their houses has risen. Some schools have considered this topic and are offering distance learning as an option for students. Though some parents acquire concerns about the health of their kids being glued to their homes, distance learning should be acceptable if not taken for granted. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it advances their time-management skills, allows for the development of hobbies, and provides time for students to build relationships with their families and friends.

Distance schooling benefits students by teaching them time-management skills. By having students set aside specific time for video conferencing or online courses, they will be able to acquire skills on time-management. For example, over the course of one semester, my sister attended college through online courses and exclaimed, ""If there is one thing I loved and learned from the idea of having online classes, is time-management. I would plan my day out from start to finish and execute all tasks and assignments in one day"" (Generic_Name). As proven by her exclaim, distance schooling offers students a chance to plan out their day and be able to set appointments at specific times to perform their school-related tasks. This is beneficial to the student because they have the opportunity to control their day-to-day lives. Through time-management as well, students will develop traits such as responsibility and independence, which is the goal for the future generation.

Alongside the strong character traits acquired by students through distance learning, students are allowed the opportunity to expand and develop hobbies. For example, my friend, who is home-schooled, commented, ""I have much more time on my hands that in one day, I go practice boxing, learn to play the ukulele, volunteer at the senior citizens home, spend time with friends, and study"" (Generic_Name). Because of their time-management skills, students are able to set aside time to perform other tasks and hobbies during the day. As proven by my friend's comment, students are able to execute different kinds of tasks in just one day without having a time-restriction due to school hours. If students were to personally keep attending schools, about eight hours from their day is lost due to the fact that there are only so many hours in a day. Due to distance learning, students are given the opportunity to expand in certain aspects and hobbies in their lives such as art, cooking, sports, etc... and they may also discover new talents or obtain jobs - allows for self-discovery. This also teaches students what the assistant principal at my school always reminds his students, and that is, ""There is more to life than academics"" (Generic_Name). Distance learning offers various benefits in students' lives such as the possibility to develop hobbies.

In addition to the advantages of distance schooling, students are provided additional time to spend with their loved ones. Because of distance learning, students obtain extra time in their hands which can be used to spend with their friends and families. It is known that after high school, most students leave their homes and join the journey of independence. This proves that these young adolescents only have so much time to spend with their loved ones before starting a new chapter of their lives, independently. My dear mother always reminds me, ""These years are the years of your life, so live your lives and live it with the people around you"" (Generic_Name). Distance learning will provide students the gift of spending time with their families. It is very crucial and beneficial for students, and people, in general, to build relationships with their family because they will always be blood and one's safety net. Distance learning could possibly teach students the value of life, friendship, and family.

In conclusion, distance learning offers numerous benefits to students that will only teach them the meaning of life and its means of survival through independence, time-management, self-discovery, and strengthened relationships. It leaves students with skills acquired which schools may not be able to accomplish. Distance learning is the guide for the world's future generation of successful leaders.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
159CB166349B,"There is usually no way of getting out of or way of getting around having to go to school. Everyone needs education in some way, shape or form. I believe offering a distance learning as an option would help in many ways because of transportation issues, comfort, and lack of distraction.

Some say that coming to the school house would be better than being able to work from home but I can show you otherwise with three reasons, starting with transportation. Not everyone has a way of getting to school. Some are too far from the school house to walk, can't catch the bus, or no one is there to take them. Even the ones who do have a bus to ride, they may miss it and feel as if they're already late they might as well not show up and with that they're missing a days worth of education. Having online courses at home would be beneficial because all you'd have to do is wake up and sign on. With that it'd make things easier on the student and the people around them.

Reason number two would be comfort. Many people during their teenage years have a high level of anxiety, having to walk around a school with many people or having to present in front of a class could make those anxieties worse. When working from home students wouldn't have to worry about that, they could lay in their beds or sit at their kitchen table and work on that classwork. Also they wouldn't have to deal with the anxieties of presenting in front of 20 plus students they could simply make a video and turn it in for a presentation. Working in the comfort of their homes could make their grades improve as well because they aren't working under so much stress or pressure. Also if they are more of a visual learner there is videos online that could help them as well.

Finally, the lack of distraction while working at home. Some people have a hard time focusing surrounded by so many different things going on, me being one of them, so it prevents them from getting their work done. Working at home would eliminate many of those distractions for most people such as loud talking and screaming, people walking back and forth, horseplay and much more. Being home the only thing that could distract a student is the student itself, the quality of the work will reflect that too. If they're doing what they're supposed to be doing with minimal distraction they should be okay.

As stated before online courses would be beneficial to the students mentality and make it comfortable at that. I can see the reasons others may believe that learning inside the school would be better but online is the way to go. It'll show a true reflection of that student as the type of person they are and their capabilities. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
1926EA0A1D87,"Students around the world always wish to attend classes at home, or even video conferences just to stay at home. Therefore some of the students never thought how its going to effect them from graduating and moving up in life. When we go to school the teachers, consular, and even our friends there for us when we need the help. Students like us mostly think home is our way to escape from school and get away from everything.

It can really effect students grades and mind set about colleges; But they never thought how it can help them from going to school instead of doing online classes. What if we stay home; we can confused easily just by something very small. Although we are at school, if we got a questions or have a issue with something personal and dont want to tell your parents about it, we have consular's, teachers, and even friends around us that will help you. If you want to know about colleges or even about your GPA your consular are at the school open to talk to any students. Our consular are always here for the students even if they dont answer they emails on time. Even when our consular out, students also have their teachers if they have questions about some great colleges.

When students have online classes they probably doesn't get the help students at school get when they having trouble. What if you get stuck on a question or having trouble understanding a question; they gonna have to email the teacher but sometimes teachers don't answer on time because they teaching a class. If you think about it, it would be better if you are there in class getting the lesson so if you have a question you can ask them it. When students at home doing the online classes, they would probably skip the class and just fail the class. But students at school when they do skip they get caught up because they would go to one class and skip the rest and think they would get caught and maybe make up the class. Being at home doing the classes you would probably have trouble catching up since you would fail the class unless you go to summer school.

SOL, Its very important for students like us to pass it to graduate. The Students that goes to school; around SOL times they start staying after school getting help or just getting extra credit so they can pass that class also too graduate. When you doing online classes or video conferences some of the teachers doesn't required extra help because you take online classes, but its all up to the teacher you have. Some people when they do online classes they do it because they don't got to worry about getting help or graduating; they want to have a excuse to not do it. Graduating is very important, you need to graduate so you can get your future job or anything. So its very important to try your hardest to pass high school and come to school to get the help you need now..

Students should want to come to school to get what they need to leave high school. Even if you don't like school, maybe try to come because your friends are here; just try your best to gradate, get the help you need to get out of high school without doing online classes or video conferences.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
65B1F548E8BE,"As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home.

Students would not be able to socialize with other students. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I personnel can't stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them.

Students would not be responsible in the future. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.

While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldn't be able to do any activies in school.

Students shouldn't be allow to take classes at home while other student's go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldn't be able to enjoy the life of a teenager. As a result, Do you think it will help student's in the future?",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B7ACED7ED339,"Students can benefit by taking online classes or by video conference. Students will be able to take online courses from their computers. Now, students can't pretend to be sick because they will still have to do their work from their classes. Students can take notes, do homework, and take tests online. Students will make sure they do their work and send it to their teachers online.

Students will pay attention and the teachers will tell that student what day they will have a test. Students will get notified by their teachers when they have work to turn in. Students can't lie and say they didn't have homework because the teacher notified them when the homework was due. Students take will take their work very seriously and the teachers will check their work to see if they did it correctly. Students were offered this opportunity to take online classes so they shouldn't ruin their chances.

Students will always have time to work online because there's no time limit. There is always a time limit in school but, when you take online classes you don't have to worry about completing you work because you have all day. Every school has a time limit but online classes don't. Students stress about not finishing classwork while online students don't have to stress. Students taking online classes should be happy they are taking online classes.

Taking information down tot study helps you because you can save those notes you wrote down online. Students can take notes on paper but, they can lose their notes easily. You can also send your notes to yourself if they ever get deleted. Students prefer online notes than paper notes because they are easier to find online. Students taking online classes will think it was a good idea choosing online classes.

Students made a good choice. But some students can cheat by using their phone by turning their face cam off. Students can copy other peoples work online. Students computers could have a virus on their computers. Students always find a way to not do their work easily.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
