20B68A9E272C,"Technology has advanced tremendously in the past few decades and is present throughout modern society. Therefore, educational institutions have had to evolve with these dynamic standards. For example, some schools now offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Does this practice mean progression for the educational system or will this halter young minds from reaching his or her full potential? It is evident society must change with trends but sometimes maintaining tradition is the best option, as that is certainly true in this situation. Online or video conferencing should not be offered to all high school students since this would prove to be distracting, lower human interaction among teens, and will ultimately be abused.

One factor that should be taken into consideration is the maturity level of teenagers and the majority's ability to stay focused. This is crucial because online classes are a privilege that is, sometimes, unintentionally abused. To elaborate, no one person has the exact same brain chemistry as another. Every human is similar by the shared adjective used to describe an individual that being the term unique. Moreover, this is also true for the manner in which a person will learn, since some individuals are unable to apply his or herself without the correct atmosphere. People tend to associate certain practices with places this is why many find homework a difficult task. Considering these facts online class would be almost impossible for any person without proper priorities and time management; characteristics that are obsolete in younger generations.

Additionally, online opportunities would limit teens from human interaction; therefore, depriving an individual of soft skills that will be important later in life. Social interactions between teens has become hindered drastically due to media platforms and instant messaging. If schools were to allow all students a choice between online classes or physically attending school the majority would be inclined to choose the easiest option which is video conferencing. Impacts of detrimental degrees would be obvious for teens later in life when a person is unable to resolve conflicts in the workplace or struggles with communication skills. The most important aspect of high school is not the testing or difficult classes rather it is experience with others that should be emphasized.

Finally, this form of education will be abused by students. The phrase, youth is wasted on the young, provides a prime example to support the idea teens will neglect online classes. As previously stated, experience nourishes the mind more than books or lectures ever will. That is why adolescents are ignorant; none have had enough time to know what will harm the future because to these individuals the future is now. Unfortunately, as a consequence paying attention in class might not seem as important as messaging friends or getting an extra hour of sleep. Ultimately, most teens are immature and will not take this program seriously.

On the contrary, some may argue that this would not affect students who are serious about school. Those in opposition might claim that this will progress learning since students will be in a comfortable atmosphere; however, what the opposing side fails to realize is that behaviors are associated with places. Another thing that might give clarity to the other side is that the majority of students are not completely goal oriented and would struggle to manage this.

Distractions prevailing, lower human interaction among teens, and abusing this resource are all reasons online classes should not be offered to all high school students. Technology can be positive but it is important to analyze the cons that will be present for different situations. While society continues to progress some traditions must be kept because things that are not broken do not need to be fixed. The educational system has flaws but requiring students to attend in real time at a physical institution is not an issue. Online courses should not be offered to all individuals because this is a privilege that should be earned. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
1C03DC666CB4,"I disagree with online classes because, if schools offer distance learning as an option for students to learning online from home to online classes.

the students will not learn like they learn from school because, it is online they don't care as much as they care in school, they will not try or study hard for it.

some students do not access in their homes some of them can't buy computers.

students have to work sometimes with other students or their partner and learn some new stuff if schools would be online courses or classes students will not learn new stuff or new listens or they can't talk to other people to solve their problems.

Students will not learn specific listens like they learn in school students do not care about their listens, they will not study hard for their listens because, there is no live teacher to tell them what to do, or the online classes will not say that do this work or do this project, and there is no other student to work with or do the group work. And they cannot understand correctly the listens it is good to go to school. when students go to schools every day it made them responsible.

Some students do not have access to be able for online classes, because all students do not have computer, they are not access to the wifi, they cannot buy computer, all people are don't have the same life. Every one has a different life, we have to feel everyone all people are not rich to buy those stuff. In last couple years they made the online classes they did not have those classes in very past years but it does not have benefit for all of students.

Students have to work sometimes with other student or their partner and learn some new stuff, meet new people. If schools would be online classes they cannot learn some new stuff,they cannot meet new people , and they cannot work or participate in a group work or group project. I don't think that the online classes would have benefit, for some people it have benefit like they might cannot go to the school but, not for all of students will be good.

Although some people might say that the online classes are good, or have benefit for schools and students but, I still disagree with online classes because, all students are not allow or access to use computers and wifi. All people are don't have the same life, all students cannot buy a computer and wifi just because of online classes we have to feel everybody, and we have respect everyone. and it is my idea that the online classes are do not have benefits as much as schools and live learning does.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
1EF3F333D2C4,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option fro students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I disagree with students being able to have distance learning at home. students could do nothing at all, get in trouble, and not have good experience with people if decided to go to college.

Students could do nothing at all if their supposed to be home learning. A couple examples: opportunity to play around, be lazy, and loosing education and knowledge. Teens are not responsible at home to learn. Most dont even do homework at home s why have students have control over it. Adults needs to manage that. Teens brains arent fully developed so they dont take much serious. They like to play outside, play video games, and sleep at the wrong times when students are supposed to be working. Students would just loose their education just worst then most do at school.

Another reason, students get in trouble entirely to much. Imagine having them not in a classroom learning, but instead not taking control for themselves and messing around outside a school on a daily. Could break laws like speeding through traffic, being a daredevil doing things that could get them in jail and loosing their chance to graduate on time. Having them home isnt a good idea and doesnt help them. Some student need to be taught directly to them or just in a classroom. It is known that when taking a test, quiz or classwork another teacher takes kids out of the classroom to another class that needs to helped direct or read to them.

Finally, students wont have good experience with people if they decide to go to college. Individuals wont know how to interact with other students and could be teachers too. A student does to college and is in a big class that has 200 other students in it and that has to present a project. Being home in the pasted years is disturbing to their work ethic and other students is peer pressuring them and rushing them, but their so afraid to go on with their project. College is an experience where you have to communicate with people. Wanting to be in clubs, sports you cant communicate because you were at home and not in a classroom doing work preparing you for the real world.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option fro students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I disagree with students being able to have distance learning at home. students could do nothing at all, get in trouble, and not have good experience with people if decided to go to college.

A1B65E2C7824,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Students being home school can lead to some effects that would not benefit them at all.

Being home school would not allow students to interact with other students because there are no classmates with them. Students not being able to interact with others can lead to them being socically awkward when it comes to talking to others in certain situatuions. Having classmates around can be helpful to build up a friendship bond and also for students to be there for each other for help. Being able to express yourself with interactions is an important skill that can allow a student to give out an opinion about a certain topic. However, not all students have the courage to speak to others due to them being timid around others. Students being home school would not benefit them in their social life.

By staying home for school students may get too comfortable being there which can lead to them being pestemistic when it comes time to learning. Students need a learning environment that can help them learn and keep them distracted from other things around them. If a student attends a school with other classmates they can participate in many classroom activities that can help them understand the material in a better way. It is alway good for someone to try new things rather than sticking to one environment at all times. By staying home students would not be able to experience the life that a student that attends a school has.

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If a home school student attended a school with classmates it would help develop social skills that will benefit them. Staying home and sticking to one environment is not beneficial because it prevents them from trying new activities and it can lead them to feel lazy when it comes to learning at home.                 ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F800DF0813A5,"Some Schools offer distance learning as an option for students. I agree with this because is a good idea some student feel more better when they take class from home, in some school the student don,t feel good, and others sometime don't have the time to go to the school every days, students maybe in the home the have more private for focus and does the work because they domn't have distraction from other students.

Students sometime don't feel good in the school is the reason they feel more better take the class online from home because in the school never knows now in the school maybe will be dangerous some schools don't have sufficient security or polices. So the students feel more safe in the home.

Some students live lonely they no have the time for to go school in the morning because they need to work like they don't have a suport they are independient need money for maybe pay ther bills, classes online is someting good for people want overcome in they lifes and want abetter life in the future.

I think of some student need like private for focus more because in the school some student are distraction for other student some time students need a good consentration for make they work o take a tess, if the classes onlines a good thing for focus more some student choose this for pas the class an graduated.

In conclution the classes online are good for many thing this really help people in their life , for make thear dreams and finally can garduate an get a diploma and get a good job.

BA7B34D01383,"Schools have started to allow students to ""attend"" school from home, claiming that this benefits students as a whole. While these tools may be useful in cases where schools are closed, such as winter days, I do not support School at home.

Firstly, school provides a learning environment which homes do not have. School is used for the sole purpose of learning during the daytime. This means that when you go to school, you go in with a mindset of learning. Homes do not offer this same kind of head space for a student to learn, as they are used for many other activities, such as sleeping.

Secondly, schools have structure. You go to certain classes at certain times, you see different teachers on different days, lunch is at a set time of the day, these are all examples of structure that a school provides that you would not find in an at home learning environment. Structure helps keep students on task, focused, and listening, without this structure a student may lack or fall short in one of these areas.

Lastly, schools have peer focused learning. When you go to school, you see all your peers there for the same purpose as you, this reinforces you to be like others and focus on your school work. The ""group mindset"" at school is that of learning and obedience to teachers. When you are taken out of that group mindset, such as by studying from home, you lose the mentality of staying on task like your peers do. So you may choose not to do your work at all because there are no examples of others doing work.

A counterargument would be that if school was accessible from homes, students wouldn't have to worry about their attendance. However, I think that attendance is mandatory for students as it provides more structure to learning and provides them an example of what it will be like to go into the work force in their later years. As when you start a job, you must attend you job. So we should teach them this from a young age to paint the floor before they hit it. Because in life, you got to show up.

In conclusion, schools shouldn't move to a more home based learning style because schools provide a learning environment, structure, and peer focused learning, which homes cannot provide. This benefits the student in his or her learning career and prepares the for the world after school.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A59E6A9BEB3F,"In our society today you can attend classes right from home. Some schools are now offering the option of homeschooling. Which could be a new and better way for students to get their education. There is an ongoing debate wither attending classes from home is beneficial or not. Although some may disagree, offering distance learning is a great option for students.

There are a variety of reasons students would benefit from homeschooling. For example, Many students learn at different paces. With the option of doing it yourself online, those students can get the extra attention they need. In addition, Students will get better and more efficient at the work they do. Making the work easier and giving them more free time. Therefore, leading to an overall rise of better grades. Students will begin to succeed greatly and get more confident in the work they do.

There are a variety of other reasons why home schooling is beneficial. Everything is online in society today. By putting students in online school it'll make them focus more on there education. Nonetheless, homeschooling can be an option because of the social aspect. Some students would prefer just not going to schools with other people or getting distracted. Also, public school may not be an option for some children. Students could be moving, have jobs or simply need a better option then public school. Online classes are just as beneficial public teaching.

Offering distance learning for students is a great beneficial option. Leads to an increase in good grades, its more efficient and helps the students specific needs.

B1AE2526EA45,"Attending classes at home, or by video conference is very beneficial. Students are more likely to pass their classes, or become more independent. Students would be more likely to enjoy staying at home and doing their work there. That way they can wake up at the time they want, so they're not sleeping in class. I am one of those kids that sleeps in class if I'm too tired. Sleeping in class has caused my grades to go down, since I'm not paying attention.

Students would benefit in many ways, for example: they can take the class at their own rate. In my math class, we finish a lesson in 2 days, then we take the test, meanwhile I'm still trying to take in what we just learned. If students could take their classes online, they would be able to get in all the information that is needed in order to pass. Students wouldn't be stressing about taking a test on information they don't know about. The worst part is not having enough time to study. Online testing would make it much easier to prepare.

Another way of benefiting would be, students wouldn't be missing class. Often time students miss school to go on vacation, which causes their grades to drop. Since classes would be online, the student could take their class with them. I have a friend, Generic_Name, she moved to Costa Rica with her family, but she is taking online classes. Although she is far away, Generic_Name is still getting her education. The only time she comes to Generic_School, is when she has to take an SOL.

People may ask, ""what about visual learners?"" Well, there is an option for video conferencing. Which means, that you can talk to a person, through video chat, to get further explanation. Another option would be looking up videos, YouTube has many channels that teach different subjects. I look up YouTube videos for Chemistry all the time, they show how to solve a problem step-by-step. While visual learners may be concerned, the're many options to help those that need it.

Many schools offer school online, which many students have benefited from. Generic_Name's best friend, Generic_Name, also started online school and finished it. She got good grades, and is now having an amazing life with her family. She is not worried or stressed about school. Online school would benefit many kids, like those who are diagnosed with cancer. They can't come to school due to their treatment, but if their school offers online classes, then they can take them. They wouldn't fall behind in school. Overall, schools should have the option to take online classes.            ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A42A600EEB0D,"Technology make the lives easier of millions of people.

It makes communication easier and more convenient.

People all over the world want to integrate technology into as many aspects of their lives as possible.

Schools are jump on this bandwagon by integrating online distance learning and video conferencing into their curriculum.

Some educators find this would enhance the education of students, because they can learn during most any circumstances, but some believe this would be much more challenging and inconvenient because of internet issues and the situation of students when are are absent from school.

Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home through video conferencing and other forms of distance learning.

When students are absent, they are absent for a reason, whether good or bad.

They are not able or willing to attend school, and they are not going to attend online classes from home.

A student who is too sick to attend school, needs to rest, and concentrate on getting better so they can attend school, not worry about the assignments they have to do or lessons they need to learn.

If school is canceled for inclement weather, many students might lose power or internet service and not be able to get work done.

Students who have to travel often due to highly competitive sports do not have time to work on assignments while at tournaments, games, and competitions, but coaches for clubs and travel programs have rules about the grades their athletes have to keep to be able to play and travel; this will keep athletes from getting far behind and from being unprepared on graded assignments on new subjects. It would not be beneficial for students to have virtual learning because, when students are not going to come to school they are not going to do school work.

Technology often has problems and cannot be guaranteed to work and not every student does not has access to internet connection.

Technology, in some areas, does not work every day and sometimes cannot be used at all.

At Generic_School, there are countless days when the the internet is completely down and no electronic devices can be used.

Teachers who have planned to use technology for their lesson have to come up with something different to do, with no preparation time, which leads to misusing class time at the fault of the technology errors.

If a teacher assigns work over a weekend, while the school can provide a laptop, they cannot provide wifi and internet connection in the homes of their students.

Many students do not have the funds to pay for wifi and are not able to drive to a library to connect to the internet.

Even if a student has technology, there is always a large chance their technology might not work.

This is not the fault of the student and they should not be penalized for it.

Technology caused student to be more stressed and worried bout whether or not their assignment will upload on time, or if a lesson will load and play, and it is not necessary.

Technology is not practical or easily accessible for many students.

Some would argue that their are students who want to continue learning when they are not at school, and they will be the ones to do the work assigned and benefit from it.

Teachers and educators would say those are the students the assignments are made for in the first place, but it is not fair to the students who do the work if the majority does not.

A student who comes inside on her snow day to work on homework, watch lessons, and turn everything in on time, but gets back to school and listen to the same lesson again because her peers did not learn the information, is wasting her time.

The students who do not do the assignment are also wasting the time of the teacher who made the lessons and assignments.

For the students who might attempt to do the work, there is nothing stopping them from sitting on their phone during online lectures and nothing stopping them from searching for answers online, making distance learning completely ineffective

Many students do not do the homework assigned while in class when the directions are given to them in person, so they will not put in the extra effort from home.

While distance learning may seem great, it is not practical or time effective.

Distance learning and virtual lectures may seem like a great way to adapt the classroom to more modern standards, but is not time effective, realistic or easily accessible to all.

Students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home it would only waste the time of teachers and students who do the assignments.

Technology issues are too great a problem for virtual classrooms to be practical and when a student does not come to school they are not going to attend an online lecture of do extra school work at home.

Students are not able to get the same quality information and education from an online video as they get from a lesson given by a teacher in person that can be adapted for each class.

70041E13A0CC,"Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. Those are the most important things school offer to students. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students.

The first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal. For example, some students have watched video, and they still misunderstand and how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students.

The second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. School always creating the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home.

The last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students would not struggle with the same mistake they did. That was the most valuation that students can not get anywhere except in class.

Eventually, classes give students a lot of thing that they would not benefit from being at home. Attend to class offer students communication to easier solve their problems, created competition place for students and experiences inspiration from the teachers for students have a better way to learn. Those things that online learning students would never received. class is not just a lesson, it is also the small society that students should have before the real life. That was the reason why attend classes better than onine learning at home. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7424FCCFC984,"The Introvert's Dream

The topic of staying home and receiving an education rather than going to school in person is one of great importance as of late. With the recent outbreak of Coronavirus, the flu like virus spread by air, there have been countless PSA's about staying home simply for your own safety. While this is reason enough to implement online schooling there are many others as well.

First and foremost, receiving an education at home could relieve a bit of that stress every high schooler faces just by stepping into this building. Some of us are scared to death by talking to people in person (myself included). Sometimes it's as simple as feeling uncomfortable in classes you don't have many friends in. Regardless of the problem, sitting on your couch at home with a laptop is bound to be more relaxing than squeezing into the tiny immovable desks in the barren white classrooms in the school.

Secondly, everyone learns differently, and being able to listen to the teacher without the constant din of uncontrollable high schoolers is a big advantage for auditory learners. Other people may be more visual learners, but have their vision locked behind a pay wall, may that be glasses or contacts. Sometimes despite paying for the privilege of sight you still can't see the board from the seat in the back corner you were assigned to. Most importantly if you can get together with classmates outside of class and talk something out without the teacher silencing your every peep, both students can benefit greatly.

On the other side of this coin, you could say that the option to completely avoid doing work would be detrimental, and you would be absolutely right. Honestly if I was given this sort of opportunity I wouldn't do half of whatever gets assigned to me. However, despite distraction and laziness, I feel some students could seriously benefit from a school system that doesn't require you go out and fit in with every social norm just to avoid being bullied by a kid with curly hair and a fake Gucci backpack.

In conclusion, implementing an online schooling option would be of great benefit to everyone involved. more kids get a learning style that better fits them, the school is less packed reducing stress of the kids who decided against the digital option, and teachers would most likely have an easier time controlling a smaller class size rather than the 20 to 30 most of them deal with currently. If you would think back to the opening point I made, you would find another very important reason to implement this new system. After all, less students in the building the harder it is for a virus to spread, and we know that even one prevented case helps the world as a whole.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B009897F65D0,"How many times have people missed school because they were sick or missed the bus? Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, since they would not have to miss school just because they were ill or could not make it to school. Children tend to miss school because they fall sick, and cannot risk spreading any illnesses that they might have. Students also are late to catch their bus at times, and that causes them to either be late or not show up to school at all.

Most students tend to stay home when they have fallen sick or have any injuries that make it difficult for them to show up at school. Most times parents also prefer that if a child is sick, that they should stay at home, and not go to school. When some children fall sick, it could be very severe and they could have trouble moving from one place to another. Many parents believe that a child should not be sent to school when they are sick, because that way the sickness could spread. Sending children to school when they are sick is not very common, especially if the sickness is contagious or severe. Having the chance to attend classes from home makes it easier for those who tend to fall sick easily or have a contagious sickness.

Some students, that do not have a ride to school and have to take the bus, can also end up missing school or being late to school since there is a chance that they might miss the bus. Many children miss the bus, because they oversleep, cannot make it to school on time or at all, because they do not have another way to get to school. Some children also live far from where their school is, so they do not have the option to walk. This problem would not occur if the students had the option to take a class from home. Online learning makes the timing more flexible for the people who have a hard time being punctual. By taking an online class, the students do not have to worry about being late for school.

Although online classes seem like a great idea, some people argue that, by taking an online class, the students do not get to go out as much or be sociable. By taking online classes, students can choose to stay at home, but that makes them less active. A lot of people would rather stay cooped up at home than go out, but going outside is beneficiary since it gives people a chance to breathe fresh air, and take in Vitamin D from the sun rays. Taking an online class also means that the students might not interact with others as much any more, since at home, they do not have people their age to talk to. By physically going to a school, students have the chance to connect and socialize with others, but taking an online class can make the students not as sociable anymore, since they do not have anyone to talk to.

Taking a class online is beneficiary to students, since they will not have to miss school just if they fall ill or miss their school bus. Online classes make it so that the students can do all of the work that they need to do for school, but stay at home while doing it. Online classes are a better option than physically going to school for children that have a weaker immune system, which allows them to get sick easily. Students do not have to worry about getting up early in the morning just to get ready to go to school if they take classes online, they will have more time to themselves and will not have to worry about being punctual. Taking classes online can make it less likely for students to go outside more, but they will have more time on their hands, and with that time they can decide to go out, and do more things that they like. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
96A0AC812CAE,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing. The real concern is if this system of learning will actually take effect. There's many benefits to this if we think about it. Benefits like the students being able to work from the comfort of their own home and feel safe, adjusts their schedules if need be, and still be able to learn on the go. Though there's also a percentage of kids that can still manage to slack in online school.

Students being able to feel more safe and work efficiently in the comfort of their own household is a major pro in a case scenario like this. Think about it. Schools (whether it's public or private) tend to get rowdy at times. Stuff like constant fights, bickering between students and teachers, bullying, etc. takes a toll on those who aren't even involved. There has been one too many times where i've been disrupted in my learning environment or simply didn't want to deal with the negative aura around me and felt like switching to online school. Sometimes it isn't even because of a noisy area, it can also be because of bullying like i've stated before. Kids who are being picked on and teased at usually skip school or avoid certain classes to not face these kinds of issues which leaves them to fall back on work. As for another thing, social anxiety exists so those who aren't able to work with others or present in front of the class can consider online classes.

Adjusting to schedules is something really helpful. This is more directed towards middle schoolers and high schoolers because we get up way early than elementary and preschoolers. There's been a good amount of complaints through my sixth to eleventh grade years to know that waking up early and finishing work early in class but having to sit for another hour before dismissing is not something we want. I have a couple of friends who partake in online school that've told me they finish their work on their own time as long as it's done before it's due. So for instance, let's imagine i'm in online school. If i'm more of an afternoon person and can get stuff done faster around that time period plus able to think more clearly because i'm awake then i'll do it around that time.

Learning on the go is the last benefit on my list even though there's more. If you were to go out of town for vacation, funeral or whatever then you can always access your classes from the click of a button on your device. This can make your attendance record look good as well by not missing any work or skipping out on a day. Some may not take the opportunity and just skip on a few learning days instead which brings in the "" there's a percentage of kids that can still manage to slack in online school"" argument.

When it comes to the schooling system, I believe every student should have an opportunity to learn however they please whether it's online or not. Same benefits a public or private school has, is the same with home schooling but just online.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Some may wonder what the point of having school on the interweb is if there is already a physical school building that students can attend.

Others may see it as an opportunity to advance students' learning.

It is integral to understand that during natural occurences, in the cause of mental health problems, and because of different learning styles in pupils, students would greatly benefit from being able to get their education online.

With a distance learning option at schools, students would still be able to continue their education online if there were to be a snow day or natural disaster where students could not attend their physical school.

Although every child screams in delight at the news of having school cancelled, snow days are notoriously known to be a parent's worst nightmare.

Not only do parents have to stress about who is going to take care of their children for the day, but they also have to worry about the effects of the cancellation on their children's education.

When I was in middle school, we had an entire snow week.

Frazzled parents, joyful students, and overbooked babysitters were all sprawled around the town in a frenzy.

If we had an online school system put in place, parents would have had more peace of mind knowing that at least their children were still learning in the middle of the blizzard.

Although students might cringe at the thought of school work hampering their care-free day off, they would be more alarmed if they had to take summer school as a result of missing so many school days.

Overall, having an education option online is a great tool to help both parents and students during natural events.

Mental health awarness has become increasingly prevalent throughout the world, especially with the development of social media platforms.

Some schools are even letting students have a couple of ""Mental Health Days,"" where pupils can skip school for a day if they are feeling overwhelmed or depressed.

Studies have shown that teenagers are more mentally stable if they are able to take a break from school once in a while.

However, many parents are not willing to let their children stay at home when they are stressed or have anxiety because parents never had ""Mental Health Days"" when they were growing up.

If schools had educational plans on the interweb, parents would be a lot more willing to let their children stay at home for a day.

My friend, Generic_Name, took a day off of high school because her anxiety was rising as the dreadful junior year workload was piling up.

She was still able to get her work done because her teachers uploaded the assignments on an online database, and she enjoyed taking a break from going to school. This also prevented Generic_Name from the stress of coming back with lots of makeup work.

An online education system would both help the student who is feeling down to take a pause from the stressful school atmosphere and give parents confidence that their children would still be able to learn, in the comfort of their home.

A typical school day is around seven hours.

However, many students feel as if they need more or less time to do the amount of work and learning administered by their teachers.

The United States, a country focused on progress, must work to make other types of learning available to accomodate for more types of students.

With a distance learning program, pupils would be able to be educated at their own pace.

Some people might even work better at home, since it is a familiar environment.

This happened to be true for my long-time neighbor and friend, Generic_Name.

This past academic year, Generic_Name started school online instead of going to the physical high-school.

When I asked him how he liked it, he replied with gleaming eyes that he absolutely loved it.

He understood concepts better, had better self-discipline, could focus more without the distractions of reckless teenagers, and even had the best grades he has ever had.

Evidently, an online school program was what Generic_Name needed to live up to his full potential as a student. Is this not what all parents want for their children?

Having a distance learning program may be a controversial topic, but it should not be.

The facts are plain and simple.

With online school, students would be able to work through any natural disaster.

Parents would be satisfied knowing that their children would be getting the education that they need, no matter the circumstance.

Those looking to increase their mental health could also do so without stressing about missing a lot of information at school.

Moreover, students could work at their own pace and reach new levels of academic achievement if they had the opportunity to learn from home.

All in all, an online school system is a great program that would greatly benefit not only students, but parents as well.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
E08A1ADE64C2,"Schools often offer distance learning as an option for students for example homeschooling, do you believe these type of classes would benefit a child or not? In my opinion I believe this could effect children in many ways, but I believe theres more negative effects then their is good so I believe it wouldn't benefit a child. Some negative effects could for example be children not being able to really make friends and a children's mental health or emotional feelings being effected by these type of classes. Some children do want to be home schooled though, in fact many kids do and one of the biggest reasons of that happening is children getting picked on. Many things lead a parent to choose home school or online classes for their child but I believe this isn't the best idea.

My first reason that leads me to believe a child being home schooled or taking online classes wouldn't really benefit them is because it's hard for kids to make friends this way especially if they began taking these classes at a very young age. What led me to believe this is the fact that when a student is being home schooled their isn't really anybody else to interact with for example another student to speak to. Most of the time it's just a child and a teacher and since they wouldn't really get a chance to be exposed to other people how could they possibly build friendships. A child wouldn't really have a way to friend someone unless it was in a public place like a mall which would be much harder for a student to do because many people are shy. I believe if a child was going to a public school or even private school this wouldn't be an issue at all for the student because they would have plenty of people they could talk to and become friends with, it would make it much easier for the child.

A different type of effect this could have on a child that would be negative as well is, a childs mental health or emotional feelings getting effected by being home schooled. A student who is being home school doesn't really get a chance to interact with many people other then their teacher or their family. When something like this happens it tends to lead a person to feel lonely and could strongly upset them at times. It would be hard for them to go out to a public area as well it could possibly give them anxiety to do so, for example if a students mom takes them somewhere public it could make the child feel uncomfterable because they aren't really used to being around many people since they only interact with their family and teacher. I think distance learning would make a students daily life much harder then it would be if they would go to a school with other students, if a child went to a school where they could interact with other people this wouldn't be an issue kids would be able to speak to other students and not feel uncomfterable going out to a public location.

In many cases parents don't really have a choice though, their best option is to choose home school for their children's own good. In many cases students get picked on at their school which could lead to a child being depressed. In fact in many schools bullying is a big issue probably the biggest issue in public or private schools it happens all over the world. When a child is being bullied it makes them not even want to step foot into a school with other students because its gotten that bad for them. When this happens a child misses a lot of school because they are scared to return and their best option is being home schooled. Home schooling often works for children who are being bullied and makes them feel much more comfterable and safer in this type of environment. In this type of case it is best for a child to do what they feel more comfterable doing because if they continue going to a school where they are constantly getting bullied at, things could escalate and a child's depressions could sadly lead to suicide which has happened before. I believe this could sometimes be resolved by switching schools but it all comes down to what the student believes is best for them.

In conclusion I believe most of the time being home schooled isn't the best option for a student. I believe a child is much happier at a public environment where they can makes friends at. A child being home schooled doesn't really get a chance to make friends the way they would in a public or private school. A students mental health could be effected by being home schooled and it could also effect them in an emotional way as well because they could could feel lonely and be uncomfterable going to a public place since they only get a chance to interact with their family and teacher. In cases it is to a students benefit to be home schooled though for example if they are being bullied sometimes it's best for them to be home school so they don't feel like they are in danger of something happening to them.          ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
49F0104EFC3C,"I believe students can benefit from distance learning or otherwise known as ""

home school"".

And there are three reasons I say this. First, is you won't have to worry about being late, because, you build it around your schedule; second, are due dates. Due dates always mess up everything, because you try to focus on that one thing and end up not doing anything else. And lastly is work ethic. When doing work at home you tend to get done quicker and with less talking you can understand what exactly you're supposed to be doing.

Now we all hate having to wake up early, pick out an outfit, and do all that other nonsense five times a week for ten months. And on top of that you have to be either ready to be taken to school by parents, by bus, or by walking there yourself, which can be very upsetting most of the time. But, with home schooling you won't have to worry about missing the the bus or walking in the rain, you can just wake up do what you have to do and start your online classes for the day.

Next, s something nobody likes, the all dreadful due dates. Due dates suck, and tend to put you on edge. I know this because every other week I have a new due date for some class assignment, and it stresses me out sometimes, because the work overload can get to be to much to handle and most of the time I just can't take it all.

Lastly, is work ethic. hen you have peace and quiet or you're able to listen to music without any distractions you tend to get more work done, which is why home school is a great option. you won't have to worry about what Generic_Name told Generic_Name or who stole you chocolate milk at lunch, all you have to do is focus on the work you are doing and be done.

In conclusion, home schooling is a great way to to achieve class work and other studies. This is one of the the great many plans out there to help students excel in what they need to in order to become great American people. And if it were up to me , I would choose home schooling over this messed p school system any day of the week.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4604BEF875BC,"A lot of students already complain about having to wake up early and catch the bus, most dont even wake up. So why not have students work from their home; it could increase the number of students who graduated,and decrease the number of dropouts. Its also important students get the sleep they need in order to be productive, students are also able to have the time they need to finish a lesson. Teachers sometimes will go over a lesson too fast and students aren't able to fully comprehend. Which causes a lot of stress which can lead to a breakdown and possibly fail that lessons test.

Online classes can definitely bypass all those problem, online classes can also help by having classes that some schools dont. Theres a lot of elective classes people would like to take but cant, because their school doesnt have that elective. Theres an option of transferring schools to take the class but students dont find it worth it having to change schools just for class. Also it may be difficult for them to find a transportation to that school because of the distance it is from their house.

Students also tend to rush things just because they dont want to the last one taking a test. There's also those students who like to take their time but cant because the teacher wants to go ahead with another lesson, this is were taking tests online at home could be really effective. Students would have all the time they need in order to finish the exam, theres no distraction, and you could listen to your own music without being a problem.

Another big problem is the lunch schedule, students usually dont eat lunch at 10 in the morning which makes them not want to eat and can also lead to them starving until school ends. It would be more comfortable being able to eat at the time you get hungry.

Another problem students face is the bathroom rule, students aren't able to use it after 3 students have gone out. This is a problem because theres a lot of students who use the bathroom just to get out of class and wonder around the hallways when theres actual people who really need to use the restroom. By having work at home you can go whenever without it being a problem. This is how being home schooled would benefit us students, everyone wants to graduate at a smooth pace.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
ABAC4A93E9C0,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes online or video conferences. Do I think students would benefit this more? Yes I do believe that this can be something that these Young Kids growing on becoming what they wanna be as adults. Do I think they would possibly enjoy this more for maybe personal reasons or making more time for other things that might be important to you as well.

Some kids that want to start working early to start saving up getting your own things, not having to worry about other people trying to get you stuff. But maybe helping family with money and things at home that they probably would want you to do for them. also putting school in mind because you might need to buy certain things for school that you might really need to get for yourself to help your learning online. Doing things on your very own for yourself and for family. caring for what truly matters.

Another reason on doing this is maybe doing things with family more, out of school activities that you might be doing Like sports. If you ever have a trip to some where with a family member or a friend. maybe take your materials and computer and do it whenever. Wherever you go and got time to get back to it when you're ready.

If not then maybe just do all the work when your back on doing whatever just dont forget about getting work done for school maybe email them too letting them know your having a trip or whatever is happening at that moment of time. You might play a sport and have a team that you love playing with outside of school and you make more time on playing with them. Wouldnt mind learning and working during the night maybe?, During the day. whenever is easiest and best for you.

Realized that there is different types of kids and people in the world where they would like to work alone and be where they prefer is better for them to work. Some kids say that being in crowds make them feel uncomfortable in some sorta way, it doesnt make them feel like they wanna be there for personal reasons that they possibly gone through in life. So thats why kids sometimes leave and go some where else that the staff wouldnt like during lunch or wherever during the day. Then the kids get in trouble for not wanting to be some where that they dont wanna be at.

So I think kids that feel this way during school in some certain classes or the whole day of school. Maybe you can have the opportunity to work your classes online instead of in school. Doing things that is possibly best for you on improving yourself in life and learning to getting your education could be a good choice for you if you dont like dealing with certain things that you agree and understand for people that want to do this too. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
9E24FDD5A196,"Many people believe that giving students the opportunity to take their classes online would not be beneficial and by doing so, schools would be decreasing the likelihood of productivity in their students. Although, taking classes online could be tremendously beneficial in the daily life of a student, whether it is by helping them feel more comfortable, helping them have the ability to attend while sick or, even by helping them have better access to projects and other assignments that could have easily been forgotten in their home if they did not attend online classes.

For example, everyone knows that feeling of coming home after a long day of work or school. That imaginary switch that immediately turns on in ones brain once they finally step into their home, telling them they can now relax, take off their shoes and do what they want at their own desired pace. Now, imagine if people of all ages, still attending school today could feel completely at ease even while they learn in class, but this time through video conferences. By taking online courses in the comfort of their own home, students can benefit by feeling more eager to ask all the questions they need to and not feel embarrassed nor, worry about others giving them strange looks. Students would also have the ability to sit or adjust space for themselves once their lesson starts. From my own experience in school, I have heard many students complain about how uncomfortable the chairs are and how people keep kicking their seats and so forth. This can be a very big distraction for many students. The amount of discomfort they experience, while they are trying to focus can distract their learning and even cause them to have pains once they return home.

Moreover, having the ability to attend class online can help students not have to miss out on important quizzes, projects, or exams even, while they are sick. Waking up early for school is already a hassle for many students and being sick, while having to wake up early could make the student have a much harder time. All a student wants to do is lay in bed and get better soon, but a lot of students often worry about all the work that will be piled up on them once they return to school, making them force themselves to attend. If students do this, it can lead to even worse issues, such as having an unwanted accident at school or even spreading the sickness to multiple other students. Video conferencing can help students stay on track with their work and also help them have better access to their medication when it needs to be taken. Students would not have to deal with unneeded stress from school and could calmly focus their energy on bettering their health.

Furthermore, the use of online lessons can be beneficial when it comes to a students forgetfulness. There are a few unfortunate moments in a students day to day life where they stay up late working hard on an assignment that they end up forgetting on their desk, bed, dinner table or anywhere else that is not their backpack. Forgetting to turn in work can hugely affect a students grade, but with the help of online courses, a student can have easy access to their projects and assignments without having to worry about their grade dropping over a simple misplacement. They can have the opportunity to easily locate it and have it by their side once their teacher does any kind of review where the student can also keep up and ask questions, instead of looking around the classroom or peeking at someones paper. Also, if students were to have access to their homework and other important projects at all times they are most likely to work on it until, they are able to complete it due to their conscience reminding them that there is work to be done and that the student had a lot more time to finish it.

In spite of, many individuals believe that there would be far more distractions for students at home than there are at school with the use of online classes, but one should take in consideration that students do have the ability to prioritize things that are important to them. Take many college students for example, some of them take online versions of their classes from home and they are still able to excel to their full potential. By watching lessons online, the students will most likely receive a much better understanding and visual representation of their teachers examples, since their attention will be focused only on what is being shown to them and not around the classroom. Additionally, Students that go to school already work on projects and assignments at home regularly without getting distracted, so taking online classes would be no different than regular school. A student that is determined and knows the importance of paying attention in school would try their best, whether they take online classes or normal classes.

To sum up, giving students the chance to have distance learning as an option for them is extremely beneficial in many ways. Not only can a student attend classes more often than usual, but they can also get the chance to learn more and keep up with assignments that could have piled up as their absences increased. Online learning can help a student break out of their shell and talk to their teacher more about their questions and get a more in depth experience in an online classroom. Therefore, these are the reasons why students all around could benefit from this great opportunity.      ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
51C3D7E06ED2,"Offering distance learning with online classes is a terrible idea and is not beneficial to students in anyway. Not only does it take away the chance for a student to physically communicate properly; it also is completely unfair to less fortunate students who dont have technological resources and it irradiates the opportunity for students to physically ask questions and comprehend the material. Overall, online teaching will have a negative impact on students and should not be implemented into our school system.

Students learn how to communicate with others through their years in the school system. That opportunity can easily be taken away with the help of online teaching. For example, if one were to compare two completely different lifestyles, one where the person interacts with people physically and one where the person only interacts virtually, one could notice that their social interactions will differentiate drastically. The person who is not use to interacting with other people will be more awkward and shy; they will most likely be classified as socially awkward. Meanwhile, the person who physically interacts with people will blossom in an environment where they have to constantly talk to others and will be seen as a social butterfly. This example shows that human interaction is a nessisity and without it humans would not be able to properly communicate meaning that physical school is also a nessisity.

Making school virtual is a horrible plan, especially regarding less fortunate students. For instance, one could imagine that a child and their parents were apart of the lower class. The child lives in section 8 housing and can not afford new clothes. He is malnurished and always hungry. The only chance that this child has in being successful and helping out his family is school. If this child does well in school and gets a scholarship, then he will be given the opportunity to get the proper training to get a great job that pays well and he will be able to help his family out. If the school system required all students to use technology in order to get access to classes, then that child would have lost all hope in being successful because his parents would not be able to afford any technology that could access the online courses. Therefore, making school virtual provides an inequitable environment for students who can not afford technology.

Online school can be a frustrating thing for some students because some words and phrases can be interpreted differently if the tone of voice is unavailable. It will also be difficult for students to clarify their confusion to their instructor without physical communication. In theory, one student could have a question about one of the assignments and decides to email the teacher about it. Then the teacher responds with, ""I'm not going to help you; figure it out yourself,"" in a sarcastic tone. Depending on the student's mood and the student's familiarity with the teacher, the student could read the phrase in a disrespectful manner and could potentially be highly offended. Then one could imagine that the student, who just wanted to clear up a misconception with her assignment, is now discouraged and will never truly understand that the teacher was joking. The whole situation could have been avoided if the student and the instructor were both physically interacting with each other. Thus making online school a negative system for students.

Some could argue that being out of school gives student more time to do other activities like chores and family socials, but this statement is completely false. The reasoning behind why the statement is false is that whether or not one were to be in school or out of school does not effect the length of each class, nor does it shorten the amount of material that must be learned in a certain subject. So if it normally takes an hour and a half to learn history in a physical school building, then it would still take an hour and a half to learn history whilst taking the course online. So overall, turning our school system into a virtual school is a horrid idea because of the lack of communication, unequal resources, and because of how easy it is for things to be misconstrued.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
045C9829A0F9,"Imagine not being able to go to school and see your friends. Although you might feel comfortable at home,doing your school work from home can be a big distraction rather than doing your work at school. Some schools allow students to attend classes at home but doing than can cause laziness and can be disturbing to the brain. Students should not be allowed to attend classes at home because, students might get more distracted if they do their work from home, students might understand better if their at school, and you can get physical help from your teacher.

To begin with, allowing students to do there class work from home can be distracting. For example, Generic_Name has really good grades and his behavior is astonishing so his counselor and his teacher decided since this was happening he could take his classes from home. Generic_Name and his parents thought this was a great idea until two weeks later when his teacher and parents started to see his grades drop. Generic_Name's parents were beginning to think it was his teachers fault, but it was Generic_Name's fault, he was so distracted by video games and other things he didnt really make time to do his school work. So if Generic_Name would have stayed in school his grades would have looked the same.

Another reason, students might understand better. There are some students who might not understand something, but there to scared or shy to come out and say it. so allowing those who dont really talk to stay at home and take there classes at home what makes you think that they want to be stared at through the computer. For example Generic_Name is a very shy person but she gets her work done. She often struggles with her class work she feels that if she takes her classes through a computer screen it will attract more attention to her an she would be laughed at.

Then, you can get physical help from your teacher. There is nothing wrong with getting help from your teacher, but even then if you take your classes at home how is the teacher going to help you it would be harder for the teacher to because, she might not know what you need help on. You might feel like your going to disturb the class just to ask for help from a computer screen.

So although schools might think it would be better to take your classes at home remember that, students might get more distracted if they work from home, students might understand better, and you can get physical help from your teacher. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1DD3D8CCFF56,"In my option I very much disagree all student must attend classes in my case , staying home by the way using the internet, online or video conferencing wouldnt be benefit for any of those students so, therefore staying home classes is not good in anybody intense, staying home classes can be the most distancing learning when you are suppose to be online doing your work you be watching television so classes home is unaccepted.

The main reason why i think its unaccepted because most of the stuff you learning in class you never be hearing about them online the most smart way is the sit in class and pay attention i just feel like staying home classes is just a not safe for examples, ''Generic_Name and Generic_Name"" ,was in a group in classes to present about cell membrane in Bio the presentation was mainly about how is cell membrane found , what is the produce of cell membrane, is there DNA or RNA is cell membrane, so on the online class wouldnt been so active in the class.

In my case all student who do the distance learning classes dont do most of there work because they dont get it check like how a real teacher would have check they word. All student must be in there classes staying home classes really dont help them to there ability my reason why i dont like staying home classes like you probably be on videos conferencing while you baby sitting your little sister so there be a lot of distance in the household while you trying to learn so no i dont agree with kid staying home.

So therefore the school should have a distance learning program inside the school for all student that dont want to be in classes with other student should be by there self in my way i feel like that would be the best way to resolve this issues it will help other student to come to there ability in everyway just with a teacher in the room to help them in my case distance learning can be fun in the right way . ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
57B23EB24F91,"Do online classes benefit a student's performance in school? Online classes are slowly becoming a normal option for high school students to take. Many schools provide a plethora of different online classes of all different kinds of subjects. Online classes benefit students because it helps them become more comfortable, it creates more time to do other activities, and it creates a less stressful environment.

First, when it comes to school, online classes would help students around the world be more comfortable. Research shows that students who do take an online class feel more at home while learning new skills and ideas.

The environment that someones own home makes them feel, could boost a students learning ability. Students know their own room better then their school and many students nowadays enjoy the use of their electronic devices. Students that do take online classes do better than those who take the same class in school. Students sometimes take a certain class in school, and they struggle. Later on in the school years, they often retake the same class online due to already having a tight schedule or convenience, and easily pass that class. Overall online classes do help students become comfortable, which translates to better performances.

Next, many students do many extra curricular activities outside of school such as sports, clubs, homework, chores, and jobs. Studies show students who take online classes have more time in their day to do their other activities. Online classes create more time because everything is from home. You don't have to make the drive to and back from school everyday to learn and study. Students that take online classes have more time to practice sports, do community services for clubs, and have more time just to relax. The normal life of most students is very stressful, and they could use a couple hours to take a break. If they took an online class they would have the time to take a break and relax for an hour or two. Online classes provide extra time that many students could use to balance out their daily schedules and keep a healthy lifestyle.

Finally, Students are extremely stressed out from constant work that they have to do for their clubs, sports, and school. Research shows that students who do take online classes have a less stressful lifestyle in comparison to students that go to school and take a full a schedule of classes. Being at home just helps students relax, while at school you constantly worry about other classes coming up and any upcoming quizzes and test. Online classes lead to more time and less stress for students that take very difficult classes. Online classes often lead to more free time for a student to relax or have fun, and get away from all the stress of school and other activities. Many students enjoy their weekends, and use them to have fun and relax, but they could have that throughout the week if they took an online class to free up time in their daily lives. Stress is unhealthy for young students and it is essential to keep a balance of fun and hard work in ones life. Online classes would help a student find more free time to do things they enjoy and they would have more time to relax and distress.

Online classes benefit students because it helps them become more comfortable, it creates more time to do other activities, and it would create a less stressful. Overall, schools should keep the option for online classes available for all students to take. Their are many benefits for taking an online class whether it be for having a more relaxed life, creating more time to do other activities, or just relaxing and being comfortable while still learning and studying with the school.                                                                                                                                              ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Distance learning is a new option for students that schools are thinking about adopting. One side to this argument says this will be a beneficial thing for students. However, other's think that this will hurt students more than it will help them. Schools should allow distance learning as an opportunity for students because: it'll teach students how to work independently, they won't have to deal with social pressures, and it gives them the opportunity to prove themselves.

One of the many benefits to distance learning is it gives more chances for independent working. Also, it gives people more of an ability to work efficiently by themselves. For example, it lets students work on their own time. In addition, it also allows teachers to rely less on their students. Secondly, it teaches students work ethic. Working independently teaches them how to work effectively on their own. Moreover, it also helps people learn an abundance of skills that can be applied into the workplace. Finally, working by oneself teaches people many important things that schools can't.

Not only does it teach independent working, but it removes the societal pressures that come from a school setting. With distance learning, it removes the bad peer pressure. First off, it gets rid of the bad distractions. Secondly, it encourages the benefits of completing work. Furthermore, it relieves the stress of performance. For example, it allows students to focus more on the work to be done, and not on how they look. In addition, it removes the feelings of having to do better than others in order to succeed. Distance learning doesn't put students under standards of performance, unlike a school setting does.

Lastly, it gives students an opportunity to prove themselves. It allow students to show themselves that they have what it takes to succeed. For example, it builds confidence that one can do do more than they think they can. Also, It helps build self-confidence in oneself. Not only does it help self, but it also impresses colleges as well. In proving that students can complete certain tasks efficiently and effectively, it shows that they have what it takes for the next step. In addition, it builds trust in others that they can finish what they start. In conclusion, the benefits to this are life changing.

Distance learning is a new opportunity for schools and students. It teaches people how to work independently and not to rely solely on others. Also, it removes bad societal pressures that arise from peers in a school setting. Furthermore, it gives people the opportunity to not only prove it to others that they can work but to themselves as well. In conclusion, more schools should be allowing distance learning as an option for students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Attending classes from home would eliminate pupils the chance to complete what they fancied to do. Students would not necessarily benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Firstly, students would not necessarily benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because they would receive less assistance. For instance, While Generic_Name was working on his Calculus and Physic assignments at home, there was no one to aid him with his homework and, consequently, he did not receive any assistance. Attending classes from home would be ardous for pupils to receive assistance. Therefore, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Secondly, students would not necessarily benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because they would acquire less collaboration. For example, When Generic_Name was working on his Chemistry lab, he was unable to complete the lab, because he needed someone to cooperate with. Taking classes from home would be strenous for students to work together. Thus, pupils would not necessarily benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

On the other hand, a myriad of people argue that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. They claim that pupils would have more freedom and less distraction. These points have merit because students would obtain the freedom to make their own rules. Additionally, pupils would focus more on their work. For instance, While Generic_Name was was working on his assignment, he completed his work because there were no any persistent disturbance. Generic_Name accomplished his assignment because there were no noise. Therefore, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

If students attend classes from home, then they would obtain less cooperation and less assistance. Therefore, pupils would not necessarily benefit from being able to attend classes from home.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work .

Many kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .

Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

They would be able to pace themselves, take breaks, and have fun doing school work. There would be a chermindis rate of success doing school work this way. For most students school work is a hard thing to do because of teachers lechers that last all class, teachers that gives a lot of work in such little time, and student distractions, schools could vanquish this problem letting students do there work at home.

Students in schools are influenced buy other students getting the off trike of there real goal doing work. The influence that other students have that attracts others is ridicules. Students working at home won't have this problem at all including bullying. Schools all over have bullying but with students doing work at home would decrease the problem at hand. Working at home would end students being distracted not getting there work done and being bullied it would help them pass and succeed.

Students working at home is a different feeling than school. Doing your work at school would make you tense and drowsy with these traits students wouldn't be able to work at there full capacity. Students working at home would help them focus better on there work. It would benefit them in the long run and they could pace them self anyway they want to.

B48D82A4EC73,"Is being in the classroom the best way to learn? While most people would agree, the classroom is the best place for learning, they might be wrong. Technology is improving, and that means people can communicate much more efficiently. An improvement in communication means teachers can teach from outside of the classroom. Learning from home is much more efficient because: there are not in class distractions to deal with at home, sometimes parents plan vacations as a surprise for their kids, and students could have a snack to help stay focused.

At school there are plenty of distractions. Almost every class has a class clown, or something that makes it hard to focus on what the teacher is saying. These distractions may not seem that bad but a lot of kids have ADHD or ADD making these distractions way worse, it becomes nearly impossible for someone with ADHD or ADD to focus on the teacher. Not only would learning from home would eliminate these distractions, it would drastically improve grades and make it so much easier for students to learn. However learning from home could be beneficial in more ways.

Sometimes a students' parents will take them on vacations during the school week. In a situation where a student does not have the option of staying home while their parents go on vacation normally they would have to miss class for a couple of days. However if the student could participate in an online class then they would be able to continue learning while they are away. this would also work with getting suspended from school or being sick. No more would students be able to miss school and say they were sick.

Finally, most schools will have lunch really early or late and with growing kids there is not really a golden time to have lunch. Not only is lunch a problem but kids will leave trash in desks or on the ground so there is no food allowed in classrooms at most schools. However being able to have class from home would give students the ability to have snacks throughout the day. this would get rid of complaining about being hungry, or ""when's lunch?"" This would also help students focus more on the lesson with their brain not thinking about food all day.

Although there is still the at home distraction or the possibility that the student does not have internet connection where ever they might go, a student could get rid of distractions at home, and they might not be able to do anything about internet while traveling they can still get some stuff done while they are away. Online classes and distant learning programs should be considered and applied at most schools for everyone's benefit.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0228C92DFDF2,"Is online school truly a good tool for learning? With the newer technology we have today, some schools are taking advantage of this and offering computer based classes. While some might think this is a good idea, there are several reasons why this does not truly benefit students because, it would ultamantly unprepare them for later in life. Firstly, It is important that children learn responsibility young so they are prepared for adulthood. Another idea is with online school it makes it very easy for these students to cheat on graded work. Finally, with online school, Students can become too dependent on technology.

Firstly, Children need to know responsibility to have a successful future. The way we can truly prepare children to be successful is to install a responsible mindset. One good way to get them there, is to let them get themselves ready in the morning for school everyday. A child who has online school would not have to do the same necessities as a child who has to go out everyday would. The student who attends online learning would not have to get dressed everyday or even brush their teeth! While the student who attends the Brick and Mortar school would have to; get dressed, make sure they practice good hygiene everyday, and even pack their own lunches and book bags before leaving in the mornings. Children who attend online school miss out on this crucial part of learning how to take care and be responsible for themselves.

Next, students could easily cheat if they have classes online. Those who do classes online are most likely not being supervised. If they are not being supervised during a test, what is stopping them from looking up answers on their phones with Google, taking photos of the lesson to use, or even notes on tests! Some might answer this with ""Their parents are home with them, they aren't left unsupervised."". But Most people today work a nine to five job everyday and don't have time to watch their child take a test. For example, I have a class online at my school. Everything is on the website provided by the school, So Students often cheat on their quizzes and tests in that class. But, because is it entirely online, there is no way the teacher would know they are cheating if they finish a lesson at home. But, when it happens at the school or even in my other classes the teachers easily know if someone is cheating on an assignment. In return, Kids who cheat don't get the full reward of actually learning.

Lastly. Students who do online schooling will eventually depend on technology too much. While their classes are taught with an actual teacher through video chat, they will not stay that way forever. Some courses are already completely internet based; the lesson, quiz and even test are all on the website. It is important that children know how to do things for themselves. If their lesson is there, wouldn't key points be emphasized? How will they know what is important to get from a lecture? If students attend an online school, it just adds to the list of things that we rely on technology for. Children need to know how to do things for themselves and not have the internet to do them for them. For example, Amazons' Alexa, she can do just about everything from turning the TV on, to shop, or even turn the Microwave on for you. If we rely on technology and add schooling to the list, we are depriving our children to do basic things.

On the other hand, some may argue that online schooling helps Students who are on home bound. Kids often get hurt from participating in sports or just playing outside. This results in them going on home bound from school. Children who are on home bound can benefit from online school by staying afloat in their classes and also keeping in the seven to three schedule of learning.

But, Kids need social interaction. Social Interaction is a vital part of development. If students have school over the computer or video chatting, they are not getting the proper interaction they need. Yes, they would still see their parents everyday. But, Kids need to mingle with people their age. Just like an adult does not want to be with a five year old all day, dose not mean that a five year old wants to be with a forty year old all day. We can't let children live online through their early years and throw them into the workforce later,They will not be able to act right in public! If you look at children who are home schooled their whole lives, they do not act the same as a child who went to public or private school. The students who learn from home do not get the fight or flight mentality as a student who has witnessed fights or lock downs at school during in their life. You can't shelter a child from the world by giving them online school. They will not be able to survive.

Therefore, Students do not benefit from online school. While home bound students have the ability to prosper with the idea.

It is important that every student learns responsibility to get themselves ready for the day in the morning, not being too dependent on technology, and also not to cheat on assignments so they can fully learn. But, most importantly, Children need the crucial social interaction that is vital to healthy living. Without these factors, a Child would be unprepared to be a successful adult.     ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
434616FBA2C7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Online or video conferencing is when students and teachers communicate through long distances through the use of technology. Students would be able to learn without the need to be in a classroom with other people. This would are able to help them learn more frequently and function more with the help of this learning capability. Students would be able to personally talk to teachers if there having trouble with work in class. The opposition incorrectly believe that with the help of online or video conferencing students will benefit less from being able to attend classes from home because students would be less social and they will not be able to gain communication skills. Although some believe with help the of online or video conferencing students would benefit less from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known that with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home.

With the help of online or video conferencing, students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home due to benefits for oneself. Having access to online or video conferencing would more affordable for students. They would be able to talk to teachers without the need of them spending their money. For instance, there are certain websites where students can learn and talk to teachers without them going to school. Nowadays, if a person would want to go to school but could not afford it, then they would use online conferencing to talk teachers without them wasting their money just to go school. Through the help video conferencing, students would be able to have personal conferences with teachers. If there are having trouble with their work or if they feel like they need help, then a conference would be a good way to better themselves. For example, if a person did bad on their test, exam or just want to help boost their grade up, then they would have a brief conference to see why their not doing so well. With the help of personal conferences, students can be able to improve their grade and better understand what their not good at. Students would be able to get their work caught up at home. Online chats will be able to see what that person missed. For instance, if a student missed a day or a lesson, then that student would be able to contact their teacher and get their work caught up. This is useful for students, who are sick and cant make it to class, because they wont be behind and they can get their work finished.

With the help of online or video conferencing, students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home due to benefits for others. Online conferencing would help students not to get sick by other people. Long distance conferencing would lower their chances of getting sick by others. For example, if students lived in China, where the Corona virus is spreading at, then they would communicate with their teacher online without them catching the virus as well. Online conferencing in today society would play a major role in helping both students and teachers lower their chance of catching colds or diseases. Students would not have to travel long distance to just go to school. With the of online conferencing, students can learn what they need to know at home. For instance, if a girl was pregnant and she didnt have no one to take her to school, then she would just talk to her talk online without the need of her leaving home. With the help of this technological advantage students, who cant find a way to get to school, would be able to learn in school without the need of them leaving their home. With the help of video conferences, the productivity of students' work would go up. This would help students who dont understand the work and what to know more. For example, if students dont understand the assignment they were given, they would be able to learn online with their teacher to better understand. With the help of this learning tool, they are able to learn at a better pace.

Even though some believe with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit less from being able to attend classes from home, it should be understood that with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home. Opponents incorrectly believe that with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit less from being able to attend classes from home because they might not have WIFI to communicating to their teachers and they might not look presentable when talking to their teachers.

EFB0DDC8EA77,"Many people say that there is a lot to be done while you're at school, but there is only a limited amount of time to complete everything that has to be done. This means that once school ends every day students are forced to wait until the next day to continue what they've already started. There has to be a way for students to be able to complete school work outside of school. Students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do more work from home, some students might not be able to attend school for a certain period of time to finish their assignments, and students will be able to prioritize their more important classes at school while completing less time consuming ones at home.

There will be more school work done at home than at school. This is because there are many distractions at school which leads to students not working productively on all of their assignments. When a student is at home it is easier for them to separate themselves from all distractions and solely focus on their school work. When a student is in a public area they will easily be affected by all of the things happening around them. The only way you can truly put all of your attention towards the task your trying to complete is if you are working alone without any interference.

If something were to happen to a student that prevented them to be able to go to school then they would get behind with all of the learning that they had missed. This is why students need to be able to attend classes from home. Once a student becomes injured or sick and isn't able to go to school having the ability to go to all of their classes virtually will prevent them from missing any essential information. Many times when a student is not able to go to school for an extended period of time it becomes impossible for them to be able to make up all of the class time they missed. This is why it will be beneficial for a student to be able to continue to get their daily school education from home.

Students only have a certain amount of time to do work at school everyday day. This means that they have to evenly distribute all of their school time with all of their classes. For students some of their classes are higher up in difficulty while some are lower in difficulty. As a result, students might need more time to try and complete everything for their harder classes while their easier ones require less time. This is why students need to be able to take classes from home because students can focus on all of their harder classes at school with peers while they are able to do the easier subjects at home. In the end, this will only be beneficial for students because it allows them to prioritize their time based on their class difficulty.

Critics may argue that students who attend classes at home will be missing out on the social aspect of learning which is essential to the student learning process. This is not the case because students will actually be connecting with other students in a new way. They will have the opportunity to be on a video conference call which allows them to connect with new people they would normally not have the chance to meet. Students can only benefit from being able to go to classes online because there are less distractions at home, it will let students to never get behind in school, and more time can be given to harder classes. This means that students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home.     ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

The disadvantage is not completing the course. These are the reason why I think online classes are much beneficial then regular class.

The student will be more focused on their school work. As there is no distraction around him. For example, a smart student sometimes isn't able to finish his work because they would be talking to other students during class. There is no other student just you and the teachers so you won't have any distraction. There is no distraction in their room if their alone.

Online classes are known to be small. There for its good as the student would have a one on one conversation with the teacher. If the student does't understand something, and needs help the teacher being able to give more time and attention to the student. When you finish with the class your done you won't have to wait for anybody else. Basally online classes are school but independent just you and the teacher.

The disadvantage are not completing the course ,because most students get distraction watching or reading other things online not related to school. Also not completing assignment or the course thinking its not school because your not going to school. You also won't be able to interact with other student. Also you can't participate in clubs or sports team after school because your talking classes online. You can pay at a private school or a team to do a after school activity.

I personal agree that online classes are more beneficial to the student. The student would focused on the school work because there is no distractions around them.

B9FFFA708444,"Learning is the most powerful tool that people can use to get towards the success, it is as important as eating everyday because learning feeds people's brain. In this paper, I will discuss about why students will be benefit by attending classes from home. Moreover, teachers and mastered people like counselors always say, ""education and learning are the only way that will take anyone towards the success"". Furthermore, students that receive classes from home are able to start working and save money for college and students will receive their diploma as a normal attending school student.

First, students whose work for collage are automatically signing up for thier highest goal. For example, attending to school and having a part time job for most students can be stressful and can cause most of classes' failures. In my case, because of having a short schedule at school, I decided to look for a part time job, I thought it was going to be easy; in fact, it is hard because I even work on weekends from 7:00 a. m to 9:00 p. m which is so exhausting because I have to wake up early everyday even on weekends. Moreover, staying at home and take classes online or videos conferencing will give students more time to spend on their jobs while they are working on their futures. In fact, students will get the same knowledge for less time, my art teacher always says, ""don't work hard, work smart"". This is one important reason why students should take or at leats consider the idea of attending classes from home that will benefit students for the future.

Second, many students ask: ""Am I going to get my diploma"", the answer is yes. For example, students in school once they are done with their credits, they graduated and get their diploma, for students taking classes from home is exact the same thing with the only difference that they are getting education from home, Personally, my cousin is doing his last year of school; furthermore, because he is also having a short schedule, he decided to take his classes online because he wanted to start working to save up money to attend college; meanwhile, he is getting his school classes done, he is also preparing himself to jump up into college. Moreover, he is getting his diploma as a normal attending school student. Lastly, taking classes from home will give students the same education and the same benefits as a normal attending school student and that includes the diploma.

In coclusion, students will be benefit by attending classes from home, they will work towards the future but also, they will have the same benefits as a attending school student with their diploma. For example, many people think that attending classes from home is not the same, that the knowledge they are receiving is not as strong as the one they receive while being at school. However, the knowledge a attending classes from home student has is the same as a attending school student. Moreover, students attending classes from home give themselves a great opportunity to start working on their futures, In my opinion, attending classes from home is a great opportunity for those whose want to keep up with their education, goals, and dreams.

25F15C75DBE2,"Imagine being stuck at home all day and your mom being your teacher. How boring would that be right? Today we are going to take a side on if home school benefits more or if going to school does. Most schools give everyone this option to home school due to if the student can't make it to school for a reason. But they recommended going to school because it is a better way to learn. I feel like everyone learns and gets to experience more when you actually step out the house and go to school.

However people who think online school is more benefical have their reasons. Such as being able to go at their own pace or simply how it is easy to reach. These all are some benefits that online school does have, but i believe that going to school gives you these benefits and way much more. Although some people believe online school is better, Actually going to school can benefit students more because you are able to interact with more people and can seek extra help.

A big reason why going to school is better is that students get more of a experience. What does that mean? Well what i mean by that is students get to actually discover and learn more about what they are studying. For example if a student gets an option to study fahion at home or at a school in New York. It would be way much better to go study in New York because you are able to talk to industrys and other people who are into fahion as well. So if students go to school they would not online learn about the topics they are studying, but they would get speaking and other skills as well.

Also another big reason is looking for extra help or learning more than what they know. If students do online school they would'nt be able to look for extra help if they get stuck on a unit. For example this one time i could'nt make it to school due to a sickness, so I attempted learning what i missed on my own, but I did not understand it till i went back to school and my teacher expained it to me. If students got stuck like me and could not go to a resource like a school to look for help. How would they learn?

This is why i believe online school is not as benefical as they make it sound to be. So this is why going to school can benefit you way much more than online school. You dont get the benefits of interacting, experiencing and takling to other students. Overall online school will not benefit students in my opinion due to its lack of intercation with the outside world.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B091F6AFF43F,"School is a place where students can come and learn from educators who are experts in the field that they teach. Students come to school in order to learn material from them and to gain a better understanding of concepts that would be difficult to learn on their own. They use teachers in order to help them learn certain key concepts. Students attending classes online would not benefit them in any way, proving that learning in a traditional classroom setting is far more beneficial to the students than taking the classes online.

The first reason why attending classes from home is a bad idea is because students learn better when they are able to communicate with others. For instance, learning from a teacher in person is more helpful because a student can ask follow up questions and get answers instantly. When learning a hard concept about chemistry, my friend was not able to fully understand the concept and needed additional information. My friend then asked follow up questions about the topic, and the teacher was able to address the issue and resolve any further misunderstandings. My friend would not have been able to get an answer that fully explains the topic if he had to learn it online without being able to properly communicate to a teacher. This situation explains the need for a teacher, because online, help would not have been provided at the exact moment when my friend needed help. Students also need to be able to communicate with other classmates in order to understand things if the teacher is not explaining a topic in a way that is understandable to every student. In biology, my teacher was not able to explain it in a way that my friend would understand. Due to this, others around the friend attempted to help teach the concept to him to help him better understand the topic. This is an important factor of schools, one that would be lost from distance learning. Without collaborating with others, certain people might not understand important topics. Communicating with others will help students learn better, which would be lost if distance learning was implemented.

Another reason why attending in person classes can benefit a student better is it gives them access to new materials and encourages them to learn the material. In person, people have papers and worksheets provided to them by a teacher that will properly address the topic and give them practice to learn the material. When my friend was talking an online class, he didn't have papers or notes that explained concepts to him. He had to search through the internet in order to find explanations, but he wasn't able to find a source that would explain it to him properly. In a classroom setting, a student would have access to notes given to them by the teacher that could address any mistakes and give them an easy way to understand a concept. Online teaching often doesn't provide understandable notes that simplify the content because the content is addressed to people of either higher or lower skill levels. A teacher would be able to evaluate the skill level of a student and give them worksheets according to the skill level of the student. A student will also better learn material if they have to learn it in a classroom. In an economy class, students are forced to learn the topics on their own by reading a textbook at home and taking notes. The teacher does not check to see if the student completes the notes, and this leads to many students not attempting to read the textbook. If the teacher had made them take notes in class, the students would have had to complete the task and they would be motivated to finish because they wouldn't want to have to do them at home. Students would rather complete assignments in class than have to do them at home. Therefore, distance learning is not beneficial since students would have access to new material and would be encouraged to learn if they do it in a classroom.

The final reason why distance learning wouldn't be beneficial is because students would feel more comfortable learning in a classroom environment than learning at home. At school, students realize that they are there to learn and so they make use of the time they spend their by absorbing the information they get. At home, students would feel stressed and would not be able to learn because they have a different mindset at home. Personally, when I am at school, I learn better because the environment around me encourages me to learn. At home, that opportunity is taken away because I am more likely to do activities that will not help me learn rather than sitting down and taking time to learn important concepts. Learning at home, people would not feel any pressure to learn because no one is able to make sure that they work, and a school environment prevents that. By taking the time to go to school, students are better equipped to learn properly. At home they would do activities that would take time away from learning. That is why a comfortable space such as school allows students to learn better than if they were to learn at home.

In person learning, or traditional learning, is far more beneficial to students than online learning. Attending classes in person allows people to communicate with others to learn the material better. It also allows people to have access to worksheets or new material, and encourages them to learn the concepts. The other reason why students wouldn't benefit from attending classes at home is that they would feel more comfortable learning in a classroom environment. Schools were created to benefit students and to help them learn and in person schooling benefits them more than distance learning.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
74B605E72740,"Some students need alternatives for learning and schools should be liable to provide them. Whether it's a class or just school in general, students should have options based on whichever way they learn the best. Some students just want to take online so they can use their resources while doing their work, others like it because it's the environment they are able to learn in the most efficiently in. In my opinion, it doesn't matter what reason they have to take the class. All that matters is the student is getting a better grade and learning more than the environment he or she was in. Of course they're people who need to be in a different environment because of medical or mental reasons; But this doesn't mean we shouldn't provide it for those who are struggling in a classroom environment.

Honestly I find this prompt ironic because this year is the first time i've taken an online class and i've been asked, ""isn't that for kids with special needs?"" ,and I find myself saying exactly what I wrote in the first paragraph! Since I am taking an online class I can safely say that it has helped me. The reason I took my class online (History) is because the classroom I was in was very hectic. I am in honors and that is one of the only honors classes I am taking so I didn't want the reason for me dropping out of honors to be my teacher/class, and that's when I thought about online class. Instead of dropping the class I was able to still take honors online and my grade went from a C to an A. On top of that, I have more fun being in this class so it makes me wanna learn. I truly believe that I can learn more in a week of online class than I would a year of History with Generic_Name. It's not that he's a bad teacher, once again, it's just that environment isn't for me.

I believe that schools should feel obligated to provide an alternative for student's education. In my opinion, the evidence speaks for itself. Would you rather spend a year wasting your time in a class that you might fail because it isn't the way you learn, or would you rather spend 8 months in a class that you'll have fun in and retain the information for the rest of your life? Duh, the one you'll do bad in.(sarcasm) Schools already provide alternatives for a lot of kids, but mostly for people who need it (medical reasons). But that doesn't mean the students who are struggling in ordinary environments don't ""need"" it too.

FAEBC736C623,"The future is progressing, the internet is being used so much that most people would not know what to do without it. the internet is being used for education, jobs, and just for pure entertainment. It can be a very controversial topic weather or not the internet is benefiting or hurting young kids, especially at school. I believe that students would benefit from taking online classes at home because you could attend school even when you're sick, you could learn in a less stressful environment, and truly everyone could get an education. Although I do not think that it's the best option for everybody and we should still have school buildings and in person education, it will still benefit the people that do believe that online school is the best option for them.

One of the most stressful things for a high school student is missing classes and having to make up a bunch of work because you were sick. With online school you wouldn't have to worry about missing class and dealing with that looming stress when you should be resting. You would be able to rest, and do you're classes, on your own terms instead of going to school sick and infecting your peers with whatever illness you've contacted. This is also a great idea for kids that have a long term illness' and normally would have to be taken out of school. They could continue with the same classes just not at their school and they wouldn't have to deal with the stress of getting a new teacher.

In Generation Z, a common problem is mental illness, especially anxiety and depression. This makes the social aspect of school difficult for some people and they would most likely learn better at home where they feel the most comfortable. Although this is a great alternative for older students, I believe this reason should not be applicable to younger children, such as elementary schoolers, because it could harm the crucial social skills that they learn at that time that they might need later in life. I believe this would make the county's GPA level sky rocket because not all people focus best in an environment such as school.

My last point to make is that the education rates in the US would rise if people were given the option to take online school. One of the biggest reasons why people don't have their degree is because they had to be removed from school to work and make money for their families. By taking online school, they would have more time to work and provide for their families, while also getting their high school degree to find an even better job or seek even higher education. If this option was put in place, I believe that the graduation rates would sky rocket and the drop out rate would lower drastically.

Having the option to learn at home would not only benefit the student as an individual, but it would benefit the county that they're in and their families or future families. Giving students the choice to learn at home, or wherever they choose to learn, could possibly open up a new liking for education that the student had never felt before and make the student find what their interested in and what they want to pursue in life. Online education truly benefits everyone, and if there's a choice between online or regular school, it wouldn't hurt anyone either. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F241492F8808,"It is really sad to see my cousin went through that. My cousin was sick, she could not go to public school. She took classes online. Both of her parents died, when she was a baby. My family took care of her ever since. My cousin didn't have any friends besides my family. she wanted to make new friends, and meet them. She was very confident, and had a great personality. One day, it was her birthday, I planned her a surprise party to introduce her to all of my friends. So she could talk to them, hoping they will get along, but it was too late. She died in her room. Nobody knew what happened. I disagree. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because students do not get to experience a lot of things in their lives, It is hard to understand what teachers are teaching, when students are not in the presence, online school is not the same as a regular school.

First, students do not get to experience a lot of things in their lives, such as; prom, events, or other school's activities. My cousin used to dress me up, whenever there is a program in my school. My dream was to do something nice for her in return that she would remember wherever she is, sadly, I did not get the chance to do that for her. Although It did not cry in her funeral, but I did it in my room. She hated seeing me cry. she used to tell me, ""Be Strong."" and I took her advice with me wherever I go. I just wish my cousin were not sick. She would have get the chance to meet my new friends, go to public school and do those fun activities in my school with me. She was my best friends, my soul, my everything. There is still going to be a piece of my heart that will always misses her.

Secondly, it is hard to understand what teachers are teaching, when students are not in the presence. For me, If I am not in a class, or I miss a day, and a teacher has taught something to the other students. I will never understand what has taught in that class without an explanation. When I type something within when I write it down with my own handwriting, there is a difference between them. With my handwriting, it helps me stay focused, study faster, but with typing, I feel lazy, I can not remember anything in my mind. However, for some students, online school is such a good thing for them. They can wake up late, online school helps people with disabilities or sick, who are scared to go outside of the world. They are either home schooled, or they learn things on the internet.

Last but not least, online school is not the same as a regular public school, because in public school, students get to hang out with their friends and couples after school and walk them outside of the school. Students can work as teammates, do group study, ask each other questions and communicate. I enjoy that everyday with my friends. When it is holiday, the school let students wear their favorites costume to school. Students can never do any of those kind of fun on an online school or home school. Students can not make real friends there. It is like, reading a book in a library by myself. Public school is more interesting than online school.

Lastly, I can not imagine to be on an online school, because I know it would make me lazy. It would make me feel confused and bored. I do not want to experience a life like that. I do not want to end up like my cousin. She used to complain about how online school was boring for her. She did not like it, but she did not have other option. Her dream was to go to the same school as me, and enjoy herself. She was someone that anyone would like. She was funny, and never felt disgusted by anything. Students do not get to experience a lot of things in their lives, It is hard to understand what teachers are teaching, when students are not in the presence, online school is not the same as regular school. In order to learn, understand better, have fun and hang out with real friends. The right place is to come to public school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5ECD00F7DBAF,"Saying that each student is able to learn the same is like saying that all animals are able to get from one place to another the same. It's not always possible. Fish swim, snakes slither, and birds fly. All are trying to accomplish the same thing, the only difference is each have a unique way of doing so. Now, if each animal were all of a sudden made to travel the same, how successful each animal is in completing this task would be up for debate. With that being said, one could begin to question weather or not students should have the option of attending classes from home or at school. Though some may believe otherwise, life circumstances, several personal reasons, and distractions prove that students should be permitted to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

Some students have challenges in their lives that may withhold them from performing well in a traditional classroom setting. An example of a situation like this would be a student that has a child to take care of. Perhaps this student has no one to watch his or her child while they are at school. Being able to take their classes virtually, from home, could assist this student substantially by allowing him or her to physically be with their child and still get the same education as any other student. It could be said that in instances like the one mentioned, taking classes at home could become an impediment to one's learning. Though, being home may serve as piece of mind for this student, and could even better their academic performance. One never truly knows what another is going through, not to mention would could effect them positively or not.

There are several personal issues that could prevent certain students from retaining curriculum in school well. For instance, not being comfortable around other students. This could be because of bullying, fear of germs, etc. For whatever exceptional reason there is, this student doesn't perform well in a traditional classroom setting. In this case, completing their classes from the comfort of their home could be a solution. One could argue that allowing a student in this circumstance to change their setting of learning could have negative effect on things like social skills in the future. Though, what may come across as a necessity to one may not be as important to another individual, especially if a decision due to this is being made by someone that won't be effected by the choice made. Every students' experiences in school are different.

For some students, being physically in school could be a distraction to them. An example of such would be a student who has a boyfriend or girlfriend they got to school with. This boyfriend or girlfriend could be in the majority of this students' classes, unintentionally distracting this student, and causing their performance in school to decline. In a situation like the one presented, attending classes from home could most definitely be a positive alternative. Some may say that a student like this could just as easily be distracted by being at home, as a result of lack of structure. Though, one cannot categorize a student in such a way due to the mere fact that all students respond to certain situations differently.

In conclusion, students would truly benefit from having the option of taking classes from home or not because of different life standards, personal hardships, and multiple distractions. The one thing that each of these reasons have in common are that the people potentially dealing with them are not, in fact, common. Each individual is unique in their own way, which is what makes them so special. Ultimately, everyone is trying to do the same thing, live. The only difference is each individuals approach. This is why it's important that one is not only conscious, but accepting of another's differences.       ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
02C49FD99F7D,"Education is one of the main building blocks of a persons life and we have spend many years in school from elementary to college or less to have our education, one thing about schools is that they haven't changed throughout the century; however, schools should be evolving as our technology does. As a student, attending classes at home via online or video conferencing would be more benefiting than attending class in school; students can learn from the comfort of their home, save problems with transportation, and even be safer for their health.

Students have been forced out of their beds to leave the comfort of their house to attend a school where they might not enjoy or feel out of place. Due to the uncomfortable feeling students can feel embarrassed to ask questions that might sound ""stupid"" or feel uncomfortable with eyes watching them, this can be solved by online classes. Since no one will be face to face there is almost no judgment, one can simply type in a question and wait for the teacher to answer. From my experience, I always feel bad or dumb if I try asking a question, so from my perspective as a student I'd be more comfortable knowing I'm asking a question through a screen and not face to face where I'd feel embarrassed. Classes in a comfortable environment at home can also allow people, like moms, to still care for their baby when the child needs their mother, verses a mother having to skip classes and fall behind in order to care for the child. Students can also simply get out of bed (or stay in it) and turn on a computer to get to class instead of having to wake up an hour or so and dress, they can easily access the classes and save them their sleep.

Another pro to the online classes instead of in school classes is there is no transportation involved with online classes. From my own personal knowledge with talking with college students, like my sister, I know that most colleges do not allow freshmen students to drive their own cars on campus which can cause problems with getting to their class if they live in a far dorm or are renting a home. Online classes can solve the problems of transportation that include: bus fare, less sleep, missing the bus, and saving overall can money to those students who need to pay for a cab, Uber, or a bus. Transportation is sometimes not accessible to everyone and can be a financial problem for some families/students, online classes can help with saving money on transportation and can make going to school easier for students with transportation issues. As for those who take a bus either in college or below, students may have to wake up even earlier to catch a bus, this can cut young students sleeping time which is necessary to the natural growth in humans. Some students might miss the bus and not have another way to school, while other might have to buy bus fares to even get to school. Meanwhile, with online classes students can learn from their homes or another comfortable environment without having to worry about transportation in general.

A final example of why online classes would be better than in school classes would be the safety issues regarding a classes in school. One of the safety issues caused by schools are the viruses that can spread fast in a crowded area, like in a compact school building. Students will be unsafe from these fast spreading viruses, especially now that we have COVID-19, the new virus with no vaccine that spreads fast and can become deadly in worst cases scenarios. Schools around the world have shut down and changed to online classes in some countries due to the safety of their students being more mandatory then having to be present for roll in school classes. Other issues with safety in schools not online would be the school shooters that have been on the rise recently. Student will feel safer at home then in school where there is probably only one officers that protect the whole school building from a school shooter, there had been already dozens of cases where there were more people injured before emergency services could stop the gunner. Schools want students safe before anything else, isn't that correct?

In conclusion, there should be online classes replacing in school classes since they're more comfortable and convenient for students, can save money and transportation, and is overall safer for the students. Some might argue that online classes are only made for students who are lazy and don't want to try to advance their education; although, that can be argued with all students don't all have the same resources to be able to attend a in school class, there very much so can be geniuses or just students that want to learn who just don't have the luxury or time to take those in school classes, not everyone is blessed. Online classes can be scheduled to work with a students schedule and not against it, they can be more convent for those with families or financial/transportation issues as well make students feel safer. All in all, the idea of online classes are concluded to be more accessible and overall better then those classes in schools.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0825571D1A47,"School can make some of the social challenges that certain students face more difficult and for others school can create these same challenges. Anxiety is something that many of deal with, some cases worse than others. Anxiety in the classroom is amplified. This can lead to a drop in grades and performance in school. Attention disorders such as ADD an ADHD can make school dreadful at times. Online classes that are taken at home will put the student in a comfortable space in which he or she can focus in their classes without 30 other things happening. Students can go through so much in their own lives, not to forget the fact in which we live in a world of chaos.

Tragedies, or ""interruptions"" happen in everyone's life and as students going to school is either not an option or is a very difficult one. Students would benefit from having the ability to take online classes at home.

Imagine being in a hallway with what seems like a million new faces every day and you are not familiar with anyone. Making friends is hard when you have anxiety because the most comfortable place is yourself. A student with anxiety can be taking a test that is very challenging and tedious and the walls will seem as if they are beginning to shrink and close that student in. That is anxiety, anxiety is going over a whole conversation and going over what you will say so you dont mess up. Anxiety is scary. As you can imagine, school with 2000 kids everyday can be difficult for students. Working to overcome your anxiety can take a long time and is necessary but better results will be achieved when the student makes the decision for themselves to take classes at school rather than home because some kids just arent ready for that yet.

Many students including myself suffer with attention disorders such as ADD and ADHD. You can just take a guess on why this would make school in a classroom hard. ADD and ADHD cause students to struggle to maintain focus and they both do it in different ways. Picture yourself day to day always finding yourself mentally blank, forgetting simple task, Losing your train of thought, and battling your mind trying to do a million things at once. This is the life of many students. Attention disorders can be treated with medication, however many families either cant afford the medication due to lack of health care or refuse to let their children take an addictive controlled substance. Some parents just think that there kid doesnt even try or is just ""dumb"".

The 504 plan is a plan that was made to accommodate and assist students with learning disabilities. This plan works by giving students more time to complete assignments and giving students accommodations to put them in a learning environment that will benefit them. Sadly students with learning disabilities are forgotten about and neglected. Unlike children with autism or special needs students with attention disorders take the same classes as the general population. Therefore students 504 plans are followed based on who the teacher is, and sadly some teachers dont care. This means the student will not receive any accommodations such as more time on test. This can lead to poor grades, and not because the student isnt prepared. A student with ADD will have to read a problem 5 times before they really retain the information and even then everything is done slower because when students with attention disorders try to force their brain work too fast that is when things are forgotten and missed.

An online class in the peace and quiet of your own home with the things you need to help you focus, things that you cant always have at school will surely benefit this student from an educational stand point and mentally.

Life happens. Students go through more than you can imagine. Everyday students deal with the death of loved ones, pregnancies, abuse, sickness. These are things that some adults can barely deal with. As children we are dealing with life's problems for the first time. You can see why that would take a toll on us. Life happens and students go to school and deal with bullying, racism, sexism etc. It is natural that kids who internally struggle with themselves will make others feel small to feel a sense of validation and power. It is not right but that is human nature. However some of our bullies are our very own teachers. A student can be literally be on the verge of suicide and a teacher can give a student a hard time or just be blatantly rude. Teachers are different to students than they are to adults. As an adult you cannot just treat adults any type of way without consequences. Teachers use their power over students to do this because lets be real, as students we can complain and complain and it seems like nothing ever changes because no body truly cares. As much as it is said the actions of those in power do not show it. School is supposed to be a safe space but in reality it is not. There are people who take everything that life gives them and use it as motivation and they thrive. Others are not there yet in life as students are children. The education we are gifted with is a blessing. However sometimes the people in the building are the issue. Going to school for 9 months carrying a child is very hard. Kids can be more brutal than adults. Having the ability to take your classes online at home will benefit so many children in the school system.

Students taking classes online will be very beneficial. My overall reasoning behind this is a lot of the problems that students face is because of the students and the teachers in the building. Online education eliminated those factors. Students distractions will be limited. The environment will be safer. It is sometimes necessary for students to take online classes at home therefore it should always be an option. The big picture is to make our next leading generation more educated than the last. Whatever makes that easier should be employed into our school systems. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
093403D63CA6,"Some schools can,t offer students to attend classes from home. If they do they will get in trouble by a police officer of not going to school by staying home. Also it will be impossible for students to attend classes from home because alot of students won't be attending school.

Students will be staying home for the whole week of not coming to school; that will be terrible for the society. Parents will also have to hire tutors for students staying home teaching them and reviewing them over topics what they have learn from school; that will not be good for them beacase it will look like they have to be homeschooled.

It wil be complicated for students to attending classes from home because a hosue will look like a school for kids staying home and for parents they will able to call more tutors everyday for kids staying home. Parents are going to be noticing why their kids is attending home from school by calling their schools. Officers will be sent by the governmernt and get kids and arrest them for staying home for school. Maybe they will miss homework and assignments from school for students staying home not able going to school and learn. That will hurt them by not attending school because they will not able of having a educatuion for not going to school.

Students options of attending classes by a way of online and doing video conferancing can be good option. Based on telling their teachers what website they have to go on is great so they can review and learn the topic they are leaning from their classes. It can be helpful for their parents by not having issues with their kids staying home from school by going over topics from school, it can help their grades improve by doing learing websites at a computer and also watching viedos that are helpful with good facts on the topic what they are learning about.

C424CD611304,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students which is a good thing because students can benefit from learning at home. If they are getting bullied in school they can stay at home and learn, if they have something wrong with their body they can still learn from home, and you can make your own food and eat the food you have available to you at home instead of school lunch. These are only some out of the many benefits for students that go to school and want to have an education but struggle to do so because of school.

First, some students in school get picked on and bullied for no reason, which can lead to very bad health problems. So, instead of the student moving schools or having their parents pay for them to go to a private school. The student can do distance learning, which allows them to still get an education from their own room. With being able to distance learning they can avoid all of the people that bullied the student and make them feel better about themselves.

Secondly, there are always students that get into a bad accident which causes them to have a bad injury. For example, a student breaks their leg and struggles to use the crutches and doesn't want to go to school. The student can simply stay at home instead of stressing their leg out and just take online classes. Therefore, they won't have to be in as much pain from their body while trying to learn in school. If they can't do online classes and decide to stay home they will miss out on the lessons being taught in school by teachers. Distance learning should be available to any student because it can be very beneficial to the student.

Third of all, some students do not enjoy school food and will go the whole day without eating because they think it is nasty, which leaves them to stay hungry for 7 hours of the day until they get home. When taking distance learning, your parents can go grocery shopping for the student and get them the food they desire. The student will then be able to make their own food and enjoy it instead of waiting all day to get home just to eat. Eating good can make a student be more productive throughout the day and strive to do more work for school. Also, while they are learning or doing work the student can grab themselves a snack while they learn and won't have to worry about disrupting anyone since they will be at home learning on their own.

Finally, Schools offering distance learning would be very beneficial to students if they are having a hard time in school. Distance learning would let the students be able to avoid bullying, be able to do school work at home if they are having issues with their body, and they can make their own food at home which would be more enjoyable for them than what the school serves for lunch. There are many other ways that distance learning can benefit a students life and make them feel much better than going to school everyday. Every school should offer something like distance learning to help out the students that they have enrolled to their school because you may never know what is going on in their personal life.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
CAB0789D6C0B,"Some schools are starting to offer online classes, that can be attended from home, to its students. While this is a great idea there are many downsides that still need to be fixed. Students would not benefit from attending class online, from home, because there is no social interaction, no honor code, and no system to help failing or struggling students.

Students would not benefit from attending class online because there is no social interaction. Generic_Name attended online classes for his entire high school career and now has difficulty collaborating and working with his co-workers. Having no experience in a group setting where he was required to interact socially, Generic_Name struggles to form connections and to work effectively with his team members. Generic_Name also has trouble collaborating with co-workers and team members, because he never had an opportunity to work and collaborate with a group in a school setting. Generic_Name has trouble communicating his ideas efficiently with other people even after attending four years of high school English online. During Generic_Name's four years of English he never had to vocalize and share his own ideas. Generic_Name did not develop an ability to share his ideas with others during this critical period. Social interaction with peers has the tendency to bring benefits in the future.

Students would not benefit from attending classes online because there is no honor code. Generic_Name takes physical education online over the summer, but drinks energy drinks instead of performing the exercises required to elevate his heart rate and pass the class. The lack of an honor code allows Generic_Name to cheat and be graded for it. Without this honor code Generic_Name cannot benefit from taking this class and is a waste of his time. Generic_Name takes physics online, and has one required learning assessment each day. Instead of showing her skill level she looks up the answers to every problem without having the actual knowledge needed to complete the assessment. This easy access to the internet allows students like Generic_Name to pass their classes without actually knowing how to complete the real problem. There is no benefit to anyone during this process. The honor code provides benefits to the student and brings credibility to the courses that would not exist without it.

Students would not benefit from attending online classes because there is no system to help failing or struggling students. Generic_Name has always had difficulty understanding new math concepts and now that he has started taking math online he has no way to obtain help. When Generic_Name went to traditional school he was able to stay after with the teacher until he understood the concept, but with no system of help in place Generic_Name is stuck in a rut or is unable to make progress or grow. Until there is a system of help put in place students will continue to fail or struggle their classes. Generic_Name recently had a concussion and could not perform any work for his online class without extreme difficultly and has now fallen so far behind he cannot catch up. At a traditional school there are procedures to bring concussed students back to a normal schedule at their own pace. Without anyone or any system to help Generic_Name catch up with the online class he will keep on failing his assignments. A system to help students who are struggling or failing is essential to allow everyone a chance to succeed.

Some schools are offering online classes to its students. Students would not benefit from attending class online, from home, because there is no honor code, no social interaction, and no system to help failing or struggling students.

There are some schools that allow undergraduates to take online classes or video conferencing from home and not at school, this is also known as distance learning. Students do not benefit from this atmosphere, they need to be in a building where they are surrounded by people there age, pushed out side of there boundaries, and prepare them for the future.

First students need to be in school to have social interaction. If a student is stuck at home learning they do not have the opportunity to interact with others the way they would at school. School is where kids make friends and interact with those people on a daily, it benefits students to also make knew friends and learn social skills. Teachers through out school years will a sing a group project so that students can work as a team and communicate to get the best grade they can, online programs can not do that because online class work with few students. Students are growing adults who need to be able to social and work with other adults for the future, schools will be able to help students with theses skills but working at home will not help.

Next students need to step outside of there boundaries and try new activities. Schools give the undergraduates plenty of opportunities to branch out and try new things. If a students shows interest in physical activity schools have seasonal sports. In the fall there is cross country, football, and volleyball, in the winter there is basketball, swim, and indoor track ,and in spring there is baseball, soccer, and outdoor track. Schools also have weight training if students wants to do something physical but dose not enjoy the competition. There are other activities if a student is not interested in a physical activity event, if they are more interested in music then they can go and join the band, if they are more interested in making things then students can join a shop class, and if and undergraduate enjoy painting or sculpting then they can joy an art class. Schools encourage kids to try out as many activities as they can so that students can find out what they are interested in and learn more about there interest. Distance learning dose not give there students any activities that could bring out there interest.

Finally school help and prepare students for there futures. There are not many jobs that will have the same atmosphere that distances learning students had and will throw those people off in the future. Jobs force people to have close relation ships with the people. Having a relationship with other workers, a boss, and with other companies,depending on the job, is very important. People who have gone to school have had more practice with these task than people who have taken video conferencing classes. Schools do not only think about what the material they teach students year to year, they also think about how they can help students in the long term.

School is nesasery for students to grow up and be the best person they can be. Online classes just do not have the same opportunities that schools offer. Distance learning dose not benefit undergraduates the way schools do. Giving students the chance to take online classes can not be allowed. To sum this up distance learning dose not benefit students because it dose not help them to socially interact, it dose not give them the same opportunities for activities the same way schools do, and it dose not properly prepare them for the future. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
1DA010DC8392,"School is somehting that is key to making the society a better place. It gives a student the tools necessary to set of on there own path. Whether that be going to college and or joing the work force right after highschool. While in highschool, there are mutiple ways to gain the skills that come with it. Going to school or staying at home and taking those same classes online. Online learning is the future of school and it will become more prevalent as time goes on.

Online learing prevents students from geting behind and allows for more freedom in education.

A common problem that most student face is geting behind in school. Whether that be because of missing it because of a docters vist or going on a long vacation. Having online classes gives the student the abilty to watch the important lectures that they missed. By having the lecture online a student can take notes, prepare for tests, as well as help with homework. Allowing for a cohesive work enviroment where everyone is on the same page. It also prevents teachers from getting behind on the material they need to teach. For example, if there is a snow day and school is cancelled for a couple of days, teachers miss an abundence of instructual time that is necessary for standarized test as well as the tests they give. By recording a lecture, it gives the student and teacher more flexabilty if school is out and or school is missed for a extended amount of time.

Freedom is something that everyone has a right to but most students feel as if they are in jail at school. School conditions students to work for a set amount of hours each day and then go home and work some more. This monotany starts from a young age and contiues until retirement. The ablity to take online classes allows for more freedom because the student is allowed to watch the lecture whenever they deem neccessary. Which would therefore allow for later wake up times and more sleep for most students. They also allow for a student to learn at there own pace with zero pressure surrounding them. Making a student feel more secure and more willing to ask question because they know they will not be laughed at because of a stupid question. Allowing for a better quality of life therefore making them a happier person. Another advantage of an online class is that it allows for more academiclly inclined student to take another class along with the preset classes that they already take. Which will help them show that they are willing to take on a challenege to pursue there intrests. Making them a better candiaite for the more selective colleges such as Virgina Tech and UVA.

School is a place that should constantly be evolving and adapting to make a student live easier. Having an online class is the next step in this progresstion of evoloution for a school. It does not allow for a student to get behind by having imporant things on it such as lectures, classwork, and homework. They also give the student more freedom by allowing the student to do the work required whenever and wherever. The question should not be if a school should have online classes but when.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
CEF302996231,"Dear Dr. Generic_Name,

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my letter, hope you and your staff are doing well. My name is Generic_Name and I'm currently a Junior at Generic_School. I believe that some students should benefit from taking online classes because we won't have to worry about turning in papers late, or having to hearing teachers to put our phones and headphones away, and also I won't worry about owing school lunch money. Online classes is a should and it can also be a shouldn't, and i will explain why its a should.

In school we all panic when we hear a due date, especially when its up close. Students work better at their pace than rather to wait on the teacher, teachers go slow just for the other students get to know what's going on. When taking tests, or quizzes, we seemed to get rush because we only have that class for and hour and some change. In some cases if we don't finish on time they, will ask us to stay after school. Some of our parents work late nights and won't be able to get a ride back home. Also in school we all get distracted so easily, like from fights that happen in school, drama, and class clowns that are not really doing their work. And kids need to concentrate in their work instead of lacking off.

At Generic_School, phones and headphones are a huge problem. Some of us like to listen to music and work better with it, but however, some teachers don't always allow it in the classroom. Classes at home can be such a big change in a good way, we won't get in trouble if we get found using our phones or even listening to music. A lot of teachers find this disturbing and run to writing us up, but they won't understand how much faster your brain functions when listening to music, it gets you more concentrated into your own work.

Our parents work and the school thinks that they make lots of money, due to that cause the school charges us for the food we eat. In some cases we get milk that's been expired, and they dont even notice it. Classes that we can take at home could benefit us here, we have better food at home and wont worry about if the food that we get at school is expired or not. Online classes can be much cheaper than to actually go to school. At home, we can eat breakfast and lunch and not think about that eating breakfast or too early or if eating lunch is too late.

Thank you once again for reading my thoughts, I strongly agree that our students should benefit from taking online classes while being at home.

Sincerely,

Generic_Name",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
07397A3E9D8D,"Education is a big factor in ones life. Without it, where would our society be? I am a student myself and know the difficulties and benefits of attending a physical school. Video catting just ins't the best idea for helping students develop their education. Bringing more technology into a society already involved with enough technology doesnt have a happy ending. There are more negative effects that this can bring than just attending a physical school. Students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home because they would start to slack in their work, going to school keeps them on a schedule that teaches them organization/ planning for their future, and it doesn't give them the opportunity to build relationships with former students and their teachers.

Firstly, getting assignments done in class are hard enough as it is. If students are expected to get all of these assignments done at home, most of these would be completed late and/ or sloppy. Even from my own experience, when I'm given an assignment to do in class I finish it more quickly due to the resources I have in the classroom. When assignments are given at home, it takes me longer to complete this assignment because I tend to have lots of questions that can't be answered by my parents or the internet. Video chatting isn't the same as a face to face conversation with your teacher. What if the internet is down and you're not able to communicate with your online teacher, what do you do now? As a student, I know kids aren't going to try and solve the problem, this is just another excuse they can use to as why they did not complete their assignments. Attending class at home will cause more of a stress for students because they will find other things to do that can distract them from their work. In a classroom, you have one job and that's to get your work done. Less distractions are available in a classroom when compared to your own home.

Secondly, school helps develop a schedule for a student to get used to. If a student were to work from home, they would choose when they want to work and if they even feel like doing assignments that day. Having this schedule teaches them time management which helps them develop the technique for the future when planning out different things. My friend, Generic_Name, has a very hard time planning things such as hanging out with friends, when to complete assignments, etc. She learned how to manage a schedule that incorporates all of her needs and wants into her day. She is able to attend school, go to soccer practice, and still have time for her friends and family. This is one of many life lessons that attending school can give you. When people think of school they think of all the work they have to complete with no time in the day to do it. By developing this schedule it helps them manage their priorities first and helps them incorporate their wants as well.

Lastly, classmates and teachers have a big impact on a student. Some kids go to school only to see those people. My cousin is home schooled. Her only friends are her neighbors and her teammates on her fencing team. She is a very shy girl and hates talking to people. If she were put into a school with kids her own age she might be different in the way she talks to people. This is going to effect her future in a way that might be difficult for her to get a job, buy a house, etc. Having relationships like those, with other students and teachers, makes getting through school a whole lot easier. These teachers push their students for success and online catting with teachers just doesn't form that close relationship like a teacher you see in person everyday does. I know going to school is hard and annoying, but it's those teachers and my friends that motivate me to go to school and get those positive grades.

School is a childs job, they can't just avoid the difficulties it brings because ""they feel like it."" Students already try to find reasons to not complete assignments and giving them the opportunity to attend class from their home just gives them more of an opportunity to slack off, lose those relationships they could've made, and leaves them missing out on developing a plan for their current and future life. Attending school gives students more than the education they need, but the lessons that can be used throughout their whole life. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
FC9DA73D1EA0,"Even in classroom everything catch student's attention!

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. Next I am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. First, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. Second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they don't focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. Last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face.

To begin with, sometimes students don't learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer.

In other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. Another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do.

For Example, in my case when I am learning something something in the computer I feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind.

To continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. Taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, TV, etc. For example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home.

At last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. For example, In my case I like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. Therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. Most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away.

In conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. By taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass.

Electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily.

Attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. It is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.  ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
01495BF80A2A,"Do you believe that at home classes are benefitial?

Persoanally I think that at home classes can be a good way to learn if the student uses the class correctly.

What I mean by this is that if the student takes the class seriously and actually does the work; and not just cheat on all of the assignments then yes they can be very benefitial for a couple of reasons.

But not everyone thinks that these classes are good by anymeans.

Some people even dispies a online class.

But that I believe just depends on the situation the person is in.

Distant learning classes can be benefit children who have disabilaties or autism, does not learn well by teachers lecturing, or has trouble making friends and getting along with other students.

The first reason that I think distant learning classes are a good thing is if a person has a disabilitie.

These classes would benefit this person in a couple of ways.

The first being that the child would be able to stay in the comfort of his or her home and still be able to take his class.

This could relieve a lot of stress off of the person because they would not have to react with as many people as they would at school.

Just the other day I was talking to a friend with autism and he informed me that having stress while being autistic can be very bad for you and that his doctor highly suggest that he has little to no stress.

And everyone knows how much stress is caused by having to get up everyday before seven o'clock to come to school.

To add onto that the amount of work that teachers cram into one day is readiculous and personally with me taking online classes you do not nearly have as much work in one day.

Not that you do not have the same amount of work it is that it is just spread out throughout the course and not everything crammed in one day.

Another way that it can help a person with a disability is if that person is seriously injuried and it causes a huge strain on the body for them to get up and come to school.

They would not have this if they can lay in their bed and do their work.

Another thing that is possible is that the student does not learn well by being lectured to or by learning from someone else.

It would benefit them because they get to move at their own pace and be able to teach themselves the information.

I know many people that can not stand to sit infront of a teacher and hear them talk for fifty minutes or however long your class is.

I can defenitly relate to this because me being an eleventh grader at Generic_School i personally take online and inclass classes.

And for mean I learn and do much better in an online class.

This is because it is very easy to get distracted by anything while sitting in class and lose your focus.

But for an online class you can mainly do the work whenever you want so you can make sure you are focused and ready to go whenever you start working.

If this is the case than online classes are perfect for you and I would highly reccomend them.

But many people say that an online class is horrible and not worth your time.

They say this because like I said many people will take an online class and use it the wrong way.

If this happens the person is really not learning anything.

However more people would beneift from an online course if the person can not make friends or just has trouble getting along with people.

For example if the student has very bady anger issues and gets into a fight every week than obviously this student can not stay in the school enviorment.

Then in this case an online class is perfect for this student.

Because they do not have to react with anyone throughout the day if they do not want to.

Another good example is if the person is being bullied really bad at school which we all know happens everyday to someone at your school.

In this scenario the person ebing bullied needs to be taken out of this enviorment.

Because so many people die from suicide because they are bullids every year.

But you still do not want the person to get behind from his or her class and cause them to not graduate when they are suppose to.

Which is why an online class is so perfect because you can surround yourself with only people who love and support you and never have to see those people who were so mean to you.

In conclusion distant learning classes are not for everyone and some people hate them.

But for those people that do like them or need them they help that person out tramendously.

And in the end the person will probably end up doing much better in that class then the in class one.

So many people benefit from an online class and no one even sees this so if you do not take an online class it is probably hard for you to understand why they are so good. They help people with disabilaties, people who do not learn great, and people who just have trouble making friends.

And their are hundreds or thousands of people like what i just mentiioned that would beneift from a online class majorly.   ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4D1755B1E482,"School brings unforgettable memories. To all students get good grades and have time for their selves is something students want through their life. Many students prefer to stay home and take their classes online. It can make a lot time for student to have for their selves. Also, can affect to learn an important skill in life such how to communicate and have friendships with other people. Although some may believe otherwise, have friends, clubs, and fun flip trips prove that students such consider to attend their school and not be home all the time.

Having friends can make a student learn from each other. For example, I was offered an option to attend classes from home, and through all my elementary school years I spent my time at home study. One day, I decided to have my classes in school with other students. I learned some many things that I have never thought of learning. I got to know new people beside my family. Making friends was of the best things, and I never realizes having friendships is to get to know each other. School is not only a place to learn, but making relationship with other people and learn have to communicated. Some people may believe that friendships can be unhealthy, cause bully, and depression to students. In the other hand, students such not isolated their selves from people, having a friend can make a big different in a students life, and learn how to communicated with one an others.

School have many clubs that student have created to help others. In my school, there are many clubs that help with collecting food, clothes, or supplies to give to the people that need it. Other clubs show new ways to make a better community and help the environment. Me, like a student participated in this activities is something very wonderful. This is a privilege of attend school with others student, we get to come out with ideas to make this world a better place to live. Some may disagree in this ideas, but have a places such like a clubs to get together, and shared opinions about how to make our life more activate in this world. Therefore, student are the future and getting to know each other it can make a different in society.

Get to go to school flip trips and explored new experiences. Almost every school had made a trip for students to have fun and learning something new. It could be a trip to a museum, a park, or historic places. In my life experience, this trips can be very fun. It's better being visiting a place than reading a textbook that related on the topic. Being home school may not give student to participated in this activities with other students. They probably have more time to get out and got to trips. Would this be fun for those student without having the opportunity to spend time with other students, and make a memory that may stay for rest of their life. People would argued about this, but being studying with other students is way to built unforgettable memories. In other words, go in flip trip with other students and spend time together can make student life more happy.

In conclusion, one point in life we look back for those unforgettable memories, and we smile at the special moment, we had. Taking classes from home can be benefit for some students. In my opinion, I disagree in this position because student need to built up friendships, participated clubs, and go out in school flip trips. Spending time with one an others can help student to be better to communicated with others and be more confident to themselves. It get student to be ready to see the world at head of them. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
AEB9F07707B7,"I think that is a great idea, because some people do not have time, for go to school every day, and could take differents classes by online can help a lot of people. In other hand , is a good reason for the people still studied, and is not an excuse for say that they do not have time.

The people can recive the classes after, that work. Students can have more time for learn and they can choose when they want recive the classes they can organize their time. Also, it is a good idea for help people that even finished high school , they can be more focus on the differents classes and give the best of them.

Take classes by online it is a wonderful idea, because is something that can be avaliable for all people any time and in the cold days when is to difficult go outside students always will take the classes and they does not miss anything . This also, help to the studesnts to recive classes every day .

I am, completely agree with can take that classes online or video conferencing is a big benefict for students in addiction people that maybe never studied in their lives can take this classes and learn a lot, because some people have to work all day, and do not can in to a school that is a very big tool that can help their.

A lot of people can be agree and can support this great idea. Also, students that want lo learn a languaje or need support in a class can choose the class most need it . and can take and extra time to learn because they gonna take the clases in home and do not miss time taking a bus or driving a car.

Even people that is in school sometimes have to walk and it is so difficult , because sometimes is snowing or raining, and they miss more time and mometimes miss all day of classes . every minute counts and that is another one great reason to support it , because people can have more time.

Seconds can make a big difference, in their lives people can finished their goals and get a diploma for can have a better jod and still helping their families.

In addiction some people can get more adtitude and concentration, for each class they can take it in the living room, dinning room or just sit in the sofa, in the kitchen or bed, every place, where they want and fell more confortable, and if you fell confortable you can give the best you can.

I think that some people work better and get more concentration , when they are alone, because you do not talk with other people you work in your own. people do not can take answer from another people if are taking a online class, so it is another reason that a lot , because you have to doing your work. and you have to be concentrate and pay attention.

people also can take the classes in the wekends . the sudents that are taking classes by online can have the choice if they want to take and extra class or get support . I think that all people ,deserve can have the opportunity that can still studied. all people should have the same opportunity , It is also a good idea, because all people can get that clases and be better proffesionaly, and good citizens and help the world be the change that de world need it, because some people that are so itelligent do not have opportunity to get a good aducation even assist to high school and how i said before . I think that are the people is equal ,and deserve the same opportunities, that others have.

Some people, can be so proud know that can retake school or begging . thats will be a big hope for the people that is not study but they want to. It is a lot of reasons for can say that take classes by online or video conferencing is like the best idea that someone can have .

In other words take online classes is a great tool for that everyone can have acces to study. and get the same opportunities, that everyone deserve. and also help to learn more people can use their time apropiately. and can have acces to each class that they need it everyone can and can work and after take the classes .

I am completely agree that is something that effectively , help a lot of people that need it and people that also, want to be better , be prefessionals and good citizens. and be a change in the world.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

_But if we attend classes from home that will by better because we will sleep more time at home and we will don't come at the school every day or wake up the same time all day, but the teachers will by attent for their students who has take their classes from home to send their work or to help they students when they don't understand or sometimes we stock to do or how to do and then the teachers will by help.

_But is a bad idea to because many students are may don't wants to doing all they work at home because they knowing they are home and when we are home we prefer doing others things except the school work and that can by a problem when we take the test because many students can fail their test, because in home we can find the answers in internet or anywhere but when we are in the school every day we can't use our phone or anything to find the answers because the teachers wants to test us what are we know or what we are need to know to by better and to resolve all you'r work in you'r own idea may the teaher can give you some ideas or examples or explain how you can do it but is diferent like when you finding the answer in internet because the internet can give you all the answer and yuo will be no learn nothing because it's just copy what are you see except with the teachers you learn more because they tell to you to try to do it in your own and you have an idea to what are you going to do.

_And it can by hard for the students to graduate because can affect they attend in the school and will many students going to skiping because they can come in the school but they can leave early because they can find a excuse to to leave and to do the attendece at home or just skiping classes and don't doing nothing.

9400D174DEC9,"In today's schools, it is often difficult for students to succeed in a classroom environment. In fact, it is common to hear students express their frustrations of being in a classroom with the phrase, ""I would rather be at home"". Although it is traditional and ideal for students to get their education from within a school, it is not always best. Due to today's modern technical advancements, a student could benefit more in school, if learning new subjects were offered on a computer screen, in the comfort of their own home. Schools should offer distance learning to students because of the comfortable working space, the limited amount of distractions, and the work will get done more efficiently.

At Generic_School, a sol was canceled due to the A.C. systems not working. It was extremely hot inside the school as well as outdoors, making it unbearable for any student to take the test. It is important for students to have comfortable working space so they are able to perform at their best. If a student works from the comfort of their own home, they are able to get more work done without having to worry about facing unexpected difficulties. Students are also able to work in their pajamas allowing them to be relaxed and at ease while doing work or actively learning a subject. A serene environment allows for students to see learning as enjoyable rather than terrifying or boring. Schools should offer distance learning because it allows students to be in a comfortable working space.

In school environments, students deal with daily distractions such as: class clowns, school fights, and gossip. However, distance learning would minimize those distractions. While working at home, students would not be exposed to distractions caused by the misbehavior other children. For example, at Generic_School, multiple students would pull the fire alarm in order to get out of the first 15-20 minutes of class. This caused learning periods to become shorter and kept teachers from following their lesson plans. The behavior of a few misguided classmates caused the entire school to lose focus on their classwork. Alas the home environment would significantly decrease the distractions that would be caused by the disorderly conduct of others. With limited distractions, students are able to get more work completed. Therefore, schools should offer distance learning in order to limit distractions from one's learning environment.

When students are offered distanced learning, it gives them a chance to learn the subject at a more personal level. Most teachers have to teach over 100 students a day, they give the same lectures and worksheets without getting a chance to personal interact with every student. Distance learning allows for students to get the attention they need to fully understand the concept of what they are learning. The more the student understands the lesson that is taught, the better they will understand the work given to them. At home, the student would not have to depend on other classmates for answers on the homework or a test. This will decrease the chances of cheating on assignments. The home environment forces students to pay attention in order to complete such assignments. Schools should offer distance learning because it causes students to work more efficiently.

Overall in today's schools, it is difficult for students to succeed in a classroom environment. Although it is traditional and ideal for students to get their education from within a school, it is not always the best way. Due to today's modern technology advancements, a student could benefit more in school, if learning new subjects was offered on a computer screen in the comfort of their own home.

D2E8E5A1DE86,"Schools around the world offer distance learning, a way for students to attend classes while not being in a classroom.

Distance learning allows student to even learn from home.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it prevents the spreading of disease, allows sick students to not fall behind, and can be access from any internet connection.

Currently the spread of COVID-19 is rampant in parts of Asia.

Japan has decided to close schools and hold classes over video calls.

It separates everyone to prevent disease spread and does not impact learning time.

The teachers still get paid, students still learn, and the virus does not get spread through the schools.

Second, there are many cases of students showing up to classes sick and not feeling well because they cannot afford to miss a class.

This is detrimental to learning in many ways.

Instruction is interrupted when someone coughs really loud, someone needs to leave and throw up, and many other instances.

Distance learning would allow for students to stay home where they can care for them selves and not interrupt instruction for others just because they are sick.

Lastly, these online video classes can be accessed from anywhere in the world with a stable internet connection.

this allows for more learning opportunities.

Schools can provide more hands on learning in various locations, like learning roman history in Rome.

These students will still be able to learn what they need to, and get extra hands on experience from these trips.

Classes could also be larger, there would be students in classroom and online, it gives the schools a larger budget.

Some critics argue that attendance would drop if schools started to offer distance learning.

This is not true though, teachers and schools could place a grade on attendance to encourage students to show up for classes.

So, offering distance learning would benefit students in many ways.

2F656E04AC84,"Since public schools have been established, it has been very common that children go to school in the morning, have a couple breaks for lunch, recess, or other calm activities, and go home when classes are over. However, a new type of learning has emerged since the technological era has started. With new technology such as video conferencing, some schools have started to offer distance learning, or attending class through a program where the student can video chat into class from home. There have been several arguments surrounding if online schooling is the best option for a student's social and academic achievements. Students would not necessarily benefit from online schooling because it the internet is not always reliable, and the online aspect can hinder their social skills.

The internet is a wonderful tool, but unfortunately sometimes it does not work. Whether the wifi is down, or the connection is not strong enough to transmit the video, having a kid in class that is learning via the internet would cause some issues. In class a couple weeks ago, I was taking a test on my school issued device when the wifi suddenly broke down. My teacher checked with the tech team at the school and the wifi had indeed crashed. It had crashed because there were too many people trying to compete for the same wifi connection. Imagine if students were skyping or face timing into their classes. No doubt the wifi would crash at least a couple times, and that student would be left to not know the content. While in theory this does not seem like a big deal, if the wifi repeatedly went down, the student could end up missing an entire unit, test, or even more than that.

One of the huge reasons that kids go to school is to establish social skills. In middle school, many kids are just figuring out how to act around people their own age, and what is socially acceptable or not. School can be a great way for kids to explore different people as friends, and how to interact with adults, however this would not happen if they were not physically in school. Many of the recent dating apps that have come out advertise how many couples they get together every year, month, or even day from using their app, but they never tell how many of those couples are still happily together. This is because it is hard to establish a good relationship when you don't see each other in person. This is especially true with young kids. They don't really know how to act around people yet, and sticking them in front of a screen to learn all day would form unhealthy ideas for how to make friends. Sure they could text their online friends, but nothing compares to hanging out and being present with someone. Students need that face to face interaction with people their age and adults, and this simply cannot happen if they are just video chatting into their classes.

Many people may argue that distance schooling can be beneficial when a child is sick, or on vacation, however, it is not hard to make up assignments nor to get them in advance. Most teachers also will post their lessons on a different type of media, such as Google Classroom or Phoenix, and the child can easily go online and get the stuff they missed while sick. In addition, when a student go on vacation, they usually know about the trip in advance. If the student is being responsible, they can easily ask their teacher for any worksheets they plan on doing, PowerPoints they plan on presenting, or tests they plan on administering. Then, they can easily do them before they leave for the vacation. Besides, no child is going to do homework on vacation anyway, much less facetime into their classroom.

While distance schooling was a good idea, there are definitely many flaws to it, especially in regards to the ability to connect, both with the internet and peers. Online schooling will simply never be the same as in person schooling, and I don't think that should ever change. School is important for many more things than just academics, and by not physically being in class, the ability to get the full experience decreases. If in the future, more people go to full time online schooling, I would be concerned both for their social health and their academic well being. I think that if everyone transferred to online schooling, we would definitely see a drop in grades, as well as a decrease in their ability to form bonds with other people. Connection matters, and online schooling does not always allow for that to be well established. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
C056C8CB9E33,"Do you think students should be able to attend classes from home? Some people believe students would benefit while other people believe students would not benefit. I believe students would not benefit because they would miss out on school activities, the experience, and lacking social skills.

However not everyone agrees with this position. They believe students would benefit of health problems, fewer students, and not having to worry about what to wear. Although these are great facts, it all depends on what would be better for your own education.

First, students would not benefit because they would miss out on school activities. For example, when you write your collage resumes you wouldn't have any clubs or sports to put down. This would make it look like you're a boring, lazy, and unsocial person.

Also, another reason is the experience. During my three years of public high school, I have enjoyed it. Mostly every quarter we get to have school dances and pep rally's. Students may participate in pep rally if they would like. Whither you like football, basketball or any other sport and you're a responsible person you can join a team.

The final reason is lacking social skills. If you do attend classes from home, you wouldn't get to make friends. This would be a disadvantage because you wouldn't get to work in groups all your work will be done alone. Working in groups is helpful for many reasons. Other student can help you when you're stuck or have a question. Overall this would be a bad thing.

In conclusion, I believe students would not benefit. But it's all based on what will be conferrable for you to get the best education.      ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Disatance learning is a great option for students to attend school from home. It's helpful and also it makes it much easier for the students to learn online classes or video conferencing from thier homes using computer or any technology that they can use o help them with thier classes that they will be taking.

Yes I do think attending classes from home will benefit students to learn . Even though not all people has the same opinion and will not agree with me in this case that it will benefit students attending classes from home online.

According on taking online classes students would be able to go to a peaceful and quiet place to work on thier school assignments. Without having other kids distrubting them from doing school work. They don't got to deal with noises of others, becuase they will be in a spot where they can focus and be able to learn much better without having someting that can stop them finishing the work that has to be done.

Students has all the time they want to work on a topic. Being able to use as many time they think they need without having a teacher telling them how much time they have left to be done on assignments, to move on to other works that has to be done. They don't got to rush on anything and having thier heads in many places, just because they got an certain time they got to be done on a topic that has to be done with. For an example they can move to other topics at anytime they want and at any speed they will like with no worries on not finishing a work they are not able to understand.

They as a students has technology that can be use to do all assignments: computters, tablets, phones, or others ects that can helpout. All thier stuffs will can be save in one place instead having lots and lots of paper all over the place, and not being organized which some students are not organized with thier personal school works. If they need help they have google they can use and it could be helpful to search up any information they need to assces or use it for any casses they would like to. Students can as well contact friends to communicate with and having the opportunity helping each other out in online.

It's a great option having some schools that allows students to attend school onine. Not all schools has the opportunity to give students the chance rather to attend school online or not, if i had the chance I will love to take the chance to attend school from home.             ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FD92F284A349,"Is distant learning for students to attend classes from home a good idea? Students would benefit from being able to do this. Students are able to relax and enjoy the comforts of their own home, there is more time for them to enjoy their lives at home, and they are not influenced or distracted by the other students. This would happen through the schools contact with home such as online or video conferencing. The students that are at school dont get the same beneficial experience that would be there at home.

Students are controlled by the rules and regulations of the school grounds. When students are learning from home they get to sit comfortable in their own walls. They get to decide when they can get to go to the restroom and when and where they can eat. There is no certain way you need to dress and there are no uniforms. It is a lot more easier for students to work in a familiar environment such as their home.

When being at school for all the hours that the students stay they miss out on that time to be at home. The students are able to stay at home with their families and spend quality time together. At home the students are more able to find their lives, after finishing the lesson students will have time to work on project or a hobby of their own. For the time that students are in school without assignment they have no objective but to sit there and wait to be told what to do, at home they are able to do something productive with that time. When students are at the school they come home from doing school work only for them to do more school work that was assigned for home, after this they only have but a few hours of daylight before the sun goes down and the day is over. After that full day of work the students are exhausted and did not have enough time to enjoy the day or their lives.

Being surrounded by so many people at a school can have a negative effect. The learning experience can be interrupted by the influence of other students and how they distract each other. Some students are intimidating to others so they feel as if they need to avoid them to feel safe. Peer pressure can lead to breaking the rules and missing out on the learning that is supposed to be held there. The students distract each other to have fun and laugh when they are missing out on the experience they need.

In summery, students would be able to have positive outcomes on education from at home learning. They would now be able to live a life of their own instead of just a life at the school. Some students claim that school is horrible and like a prison, they only see this because they spend all of their childhood in a school. An education is important but what is also important is students having their own lives beyond school reputation.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
E88B3A355149,"Online Class Are Highly Beneficial to Our Society's Students

Just imagine if you could take a class that would support you greatly in your future pursuits. Truthfully, we already have them; they are online classes. For example, my school district, Generic_School, has Virtual Generic_School. In these classes, students are able to fulfill credits or take classes that help students gain knowledge on a certain topic. Unfortunately, there is a debate about students having the option of attending class online, but based on my experience, online classes are highly beneficial towards the students because they aid the personal pursuits of the student and teach students a higher level of independence.

Firstly, attending classes online from home aids in the personal pursuits of the student. For example, some of my classmates that are Seniors will take the Physics Honors class on Virtual Generic_School, so they are able to take a job during their Early Release block(students are able to leave early to pursue other interests.) When Seniors are able to take a job, they are able to gain funds to attend the college of their choice. This is greatly helpful because in college tuition is rising, and many former college students say, ""they lack the funds to pay for college tuition."" Due to this, an online class provides time for the student to pay for their college tuition in a proper manner. Additionally, I took a Virtual Generic_School Course on Personal Finance and Economics, so I could get an Early Release for my Senior Year. Thankfully, I was successful in this class; this provided my a free extra period in which I will use to volunteer at the Generic_City Hospice, so I can gain medical experience and aid the community in a positive manner. As you can see, attending online classes from home greatly enhance the possibility that a student can pursue their personal pursuits aiding them in a great positive manner.

Furthermore, online classes are supporting a student to learn a higher aspect of independence. For example, the student is not being forced towards waking up and coming to class. In this case, the student must have the desire to continue the class. This demonstrates the ideal of drive, and employers want to see that you have the initiative to complete tasks because this proves that the employee truly cares about the success of the company and has a great sense of drive. Also, my online class on Personal Finance and Economic taught me a great level of time management. During this time, I had a family trip and many guitar events coinciding with my online class. Due to this, I had to manage my time at an extremely high level which supported me to finish the class before the due date. As a matter of fact, this learning of time management made me understand the value of time and how to use it in a more efficient manner. This aided me greatly in sophomore year because the classes that I took were of higher rigor, but I was still able to increase my GPA and pursue my personal interests because of the level of time management that I had learned. Time management is greatly needed in independent life because without time management, there would be chaos in life, we would never be able to manage work and personal life causing a great deal of stress within us. In conclusion, these examples show that online classes provide the student with a learned sense of independence.

Many supporters of not implementing an online class, say, ""online classes are going to cause students to forget about the old, classic way of teaching."" While this may be true, we are in a society that is changing rapidly, and we need to benefit ourselves in the greatest possibility. Even if that means that we must switch our teaching styles. In the technology era, we are required to use the computer and understand its functions at a great level; the online classes are some of the best providers of understanding technology at a higher level. This could provide our students to be more capable in the workforce, so they can gain more opportunities and a higher level of success among their peers.

In conclusion, online classes are highly beneficial towards students because they aid students to strive for their personal pursuits, garner a higher level of independence, and keep us on track in a very rapid changing society. These classes are highly beneficial, and the success created by online classes highly outweigh any negatives that may be caused by online classes. Now, we should stop imagining us having online class and begin to implement these classes because without our implementation, this could cause a great deal of failure within our society.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

2B9C5C3BB7B9,"Studies have shown that there is a 25% higher passing rate from students that attend to online classes. If it wasn't for the advance tecnology the world has today there wouldn't be things like online schools. Now and days everyone has tecnology ether in their pockets due to there cell phones or at home with their laptop's , computer's , gaming system's and their smart tv's.

Now with this new technology the school systems' have taken advantage by making online classes, Therefore students are able to attend classes form the comfort of there own home. Some schools are given the students the option to choose between online classes or going to normal school classes.

Some would say that online classes would not benefit students i'd say they are wrong. These are some reasons i think that online classes are better and benefit's way more than normal school classes, because there are no distractions in online classes. In online classes students dont have to deal with things like waking up early, people , and much more. I had a cousin that took online classes and what i saw she was able to start when she was free she'd finish in two hours or less, Then the program would let her know when she'd finish the leason of the day. She was a teen mom and when she found out how easy taken online classes were she got support from the family as she finished with the help of online classes and her family she got her life together.

The people that say that online classes aren't beneficail might not have gone through what 80% of people have gone through. Here' an example in regular school classes there are distractions everywhere like friends, other class mates, teachers, aslo the fear of getting bullied. When someone has friends in class they much rather talk to them then to pay attenion in class. When in class you might no peolpe and it may get into your head which would give you another distracion. Now with a student that is in online classes won't have to worry about those issuses.

Even the simple things could affect your ability to be able to learn like what you eat. If you dont eat anything during the day you get hungry and that becomes a distracion. In most schools they serve horrible food with that students feel sick after eating. now a benefit with having classes online people can make food at home. After an heathly and amazing lunch they are ready to learn and too pay attention.

Not only is things like food vary inportant but time is another one. Due to bad habbits people go to sleep late and then they have two hours of sleep and going to school. Once class starts they fall asleep and dont learn anything. Since schools start early makes it wrose for the ones who go to sleep late at night. The lack of sleep affects the student mentally and physically, With a student that is in the online class can start when ever there free.

Last but not least what most of the students fear the most is bullying. In normal schools studies have shown that 80% of students have been bullied. That would mean if there were a table of ten students 8 out of those 10 students where bullied. Many people fear of getting bullied since what it was done to many students through out the years. What it dose is it makes school not feel safe for them and then they want to stop going. Now with online classes students shall not fear in getting bullied since they would take there classes in there house.

In conclusion i believe that online classes are the best and have the most benefits due to all the examples i've given. From lunch, time, distrctions and bullies those are the reasons students have a hard time to focuse in regular school classes. A huge thanks to the new tecnology for being able to help us learn without the struggle and fear. What i saw my cousin go though i can say online is the best piont blank. I've given all tmy examples and details also personal storys on the benefits of online school that is all i have to offer fairwell.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A6546D2758D0,"Do you know that many schools would not attend classes from home. The schools say that attend classes at the school a lot batter than attend from home. Many students would like to attend from home so they can sleep more, but It will not help them to be success in education, even it will make them more lazy, and they will not have that support to study. Attend classes at home by way of online or video conferencing is not good idea and ti's not helpful for all the students. Thay will not be success in thair education and they will have very hared time studing.

When taking an online classes Many of the students will not be success in the studing. If you had a good graed in classroom and change to online class your graed will go dwon. When you take online class you will not have that much explaination on waht the teacher talking about. For example, when you study with your friends all the time and on time you studing by yourself you will feel your missing something and you will have a hared time studing by yourself.

Attending classes online will make some of the students so lazy. They will be lazy to wake up on time to attend the classes, they will not work hared and payattention. For example, my friend took an online class last year and he failed the calss I asked him why you failed the class he said ""man I was sleeping all the time and I didn't attend the class every day that's way I failed"". that is what happend to him he was so lazy and in the end he failed.

Attend classes online will be not good for students who don't understand clearly. In the classroom will be easily to get the idea because you need someone in fron of you to teaching you and to explaining to you clearly to understand good. When you take an online calss you will not be as in the classroom, in the class is differant, you will have a teacher who will help you when you need and explain to you clearly. Also, if you didn't understand you can also ask the teacher explain again.

All the schools shoud not offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes form home. That will be not helpful for the students. The students sould go to school and study in the calssrooms with the theachers in front of them.

85800ECFE568,"Some schools offer distance learning ,or online classes, as a way for students to learn outside of school. These online classes have numerous benefits such as: learning while being home, having more classes even with a full schedule, and learning at your own pace.

With the recent outbreak of the corona virus many counties where it has a presence have closed putting a halt on classes. However, with the option of online classes student can continue to learn with schools closed. I have three cousins who live in Washington state near Generic_City. A student in there school happened to test positive for the corona virus forcing the schools to close for two weeks. The students were assigned online courses and a specific time requirement to meet each day on there classes. And this doesn't have to be for a pandemic like the corona virus, student can simply miss a couple days due too a cold and not fall behind on their work. Or have a sporting event which they would have to miss school for. With the option of online learning students can learn while being outside the classroom and not fall behind.

Student wishing to add more classes to their schedule can also take online classes. I have many friends who attend the Generic_School which takes up an entire day of there schedule giving them four less classes. Some of those classes are required for graduation such as economics and personal finance. Those friends are currently taking those classes online and I have had the chance to talk to them about it over the course of the year, They said while it is sometimes hard to be able to focus taking at classes at home it's much better than the alternative of taking a summer course. Periodic unit test for those classes keep them on track of where they need to be in the class.

Online classes also give students the option of learning at their own pace. Instead of a teacher jumping from next question to next question to the next, students can take there time on each problem, unit, or subject. Whether it be derivatives in calculus, commas in English, or balancing equations in chemistry; student can take as much time as necessary for them to understand the content at hand. This also goes the other way around, student who are advanced can learn at an accelerated rate getting more in depth to the content and better preparing them selves for test like an AP exam, SAT, or ACT.

In conclusion, the benefits of online classes heavily out way the cons of the option of distance learning. I'm not saying to get rid of regular school, but the option of an alternative method of learning can only help students. Whether it be because a student missed class because they were sick, they can take an online class for the subject he/she missed. It's a way for student to take more classes outside of the 8 classes they have to take at school. And students can learn at there own pace never getting left behind or being held behind.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9D1F1FD728E3,"I think that video conferencing is great because the students will be able to get notes if they're sick or injured. The video conference is good for a couple of reasons: 1.) So sick students can attend class without getting anyone else sick, 2.) If the student is on a trip somewhere and needs his/her work so they won't fail, 3.) If the student has an injury that causes them not to be able to go places or do certain things. Those will be the topics that I will be discussing in my essay.

The first reason that I said was if the student is sick. If we couldn't use the video conference then some students will fall behind and this will cause them to fail. But if we use it then they can get caught up and they will know what they are going to be doing in class when they come back. Some students might even get ahead in the class if they do this.

My second reason is if the student went on a trip somewhere and needed to make up some work. They could video chat and get the work so they won't fail the class. This will help them succeed and push them to come to class. Like I said before they might get ahead in class and then get to relax and take a break.

My third and final reason is if the student has a injury that causes them to be unable to come to class. This is why we need this video conference so that students can get there work if they are unable to get it and learn it the correct way. I know if I get makeup work from a teacher it's going to be hard because i didn't learn any of it because I was absent for the lesson.

THose are all the reasons why we should have video conferences. We have them to help out the students who are sick, injured, or failing. There is nothing wrong with video chats, they help us with our work so we can get it done and won't have to worry about it any more.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
6D39215A55E1,"Students would benefit if they were able to attend classes away from schools because not all students have the time to go to school and come back to their homes to get ready to go to important places they need to be at. Students need to attend places such as jobs, meetings, and appointments; most of the time they need to go back home to get what they need to get ready to attend those places. They can do that if they attend classes online or video conferencing at home. A good amount of students also don't feel comfortable working around other students or just people in general. Video online or video conferencing is a great way to solve these problems and make a lot of students life easier.

Online schools save students time because they don't have to ride a bus to and back from school everyday. A bus can sometimes take up to an hour to drop you off at your neighborhood. They can be home for as long as they need to if they use online schools. Some students benefit from video conferencing because they are able to speak to a teacher through their computer at home when they need help with a problem of some sort. Video conferencing stops the need for students to go to school and speak to a teacher in person about a problem they have. Online schools are able to relieve a lot of students from stress since they have more time for work they need to complete.

Online schools are the future because they are able to greatly benefit students from having to go from their home to school everyday knowing they need have a lot of work to do when they get back home. Students who use online schools are able to complete more tasks in less time, therefore they have more free time to enjoy the rest of their day.

EEF3247D69D0,"Some schools propose the idea of distance knowledge as an option for students to take online classes or having meetings from home. I honestly don't agree because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school and not at home, socialize better and understand what is outside of the world. Here is why I don't agree by this reasons.

My first reason of why, I dont agree that students should take classes at home is because students can have the opportunity to learn more when they are at school. My mom always taught me that is better having a good education when you are in the environment, because you see people around you that are having the motivation to learn everyday. When my mom was in high school, her education was easy because she got the support by her teachers in any classes that she couldn't understand. Many of her friends were working hard to get good grades, she never did homework at home; it was difficult for her to study in an environment where people usually can get lazy in their own space to have any break. ""You can't compare a temple with a laboratory science, both are too opposites and what happens with school is the place where you have to focus for what you are learning while our home is the space where we can take any break after our hard work"". My mom

My second reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students can socialize better when they are at school. As my own experience, we have the opportunity to meet other students while we our in classes. For example: ""I am very shy to ask a teacher any question, so I go and I ask to another student who does understand what the teacher is explaining"". Meeting new people in school is a good experience because you can make connections with any other students and teachers also; thanks to that communication, we can have that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. Therefore school can be our first path of having a good or professional communication with any person, for example, applying for a job.

Another reason of why, I don't agree that students should take classes at home is because students will understand what is outside of the world. As I said before, socialize can give us that trust of our self to be prepared of anything. The position of school of giving good education to students every year is the real path to prepare us for what is outside. One of my teachers, Mr. Generic_Name, shared to all of his class of how hard workers we have to be in life, he never gave up on his goals. At the beginning, it was hard for him after he graduated from high school to college because everything was different for him; meeting new people with a new environment wasn't easy, but he always tries his best of himself by using the same method that school gave him, by been open mind and having good communications with others. Mr. Generic_Name also believes that life is always a challenge for us and is better to face that instead of been afraid. ""I you think that school is the worst place where you can't handle it and you prefer to lock yourself at home, then you won't like what is outside"".

Some students may argue that is a better option to take classes at home because they don't feel comfortable with other students, if a student have an accident;the student can finish any work at home, or school is not the best improvement for them.

the reason of why some students don't get comfortable in school is because they might have the afraid for other students who want to feel superior from others and bullying is an obstacle for the them and not have the opportunity to defend themselves, or the other reason might be that they don't like to socialize. I personally believe, that students can find a better way to solve their problem by communicating with their own parents or with the teacher that they can trust, figuring out a way to make the student feel comfortable. If the student doesn't like to socialize and prefers to stay at home, the student needs to understand that even outside is not a paradise, people in school who can make him feel that the student is not alone and sometimes is better to talk.

Finally, if some schools offers the opportunity to study at home can be a good benefit for the student. Even tho is not a bad option studying at home, the best option to understand everything in classes is when you are in a building with other people with the same level as you are of learning and you can share any of your experience with others. One of this circumstance that can happen in life for example: If a student has an accident were he/she can't return to school for a while, is understandable that the student can do their work at home, but after they return as healthy they were is better for them to go to school because the student can still have the support from their teachers.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
E508BAFC3BF9,"Yes I agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

At that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day.

It's not noly online you take the class online but, you will have a viedo conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you.

The school give them a big opportunity to progress, to have a good education and a better future.

For me it is a great option for them to attend it.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
2C24880113A2,"School is not always about learning in one specific building. It can be anywhere you wish, if you do only schooling. So many students deal with anxiety and that affects their grades. Working from home will give them a relaxing, comfortable space. When someone is familiar with a place they tend to focus easier. In a school building there are a lot of distractions, which takes focus away from a student's work. Not being at school can also be the leading issue for some students to fail classes. If they had an option to work at home it could save plenty of students and their grades. There are many benefits to working at home on school, but here are just a few.

Anxiety is an issue plenty of students suffer from in their day to day lives. It can cause students to focus on trivial things, like their clothes, makeup, hair, and handwriting. When the student woks from home it will help keep them from stressing over the little things. It would help them from over thinking on small issues that will not greatly impact the student. A form of anxiety is social anxiety, which is the fear of being social. Online school will help the student from worrying over socializing with their fellow peers.

Comfort is an important part of a students' life and mental health. School is stressful; with all the hustling of people. Online school would help the student to work in a place that they are familiar and feel safe in. They can choose the place that they work in. The feeling of control, from the fact that they choose where they work and what they work on, will give the student a relaxing and stress free environment. The relaxing will help the student to focus on their work and not get bad grades. A comfortable and relaxing enviremont is essential to some students.

When in a classroom there is a lot of commotion that goes on around the school. The distraction range from someone digging in their backpack to students screaming in the hallways. To certain students they can't just sit still and work. If they work at home it may help them from failing their classes. In an actual school you have field trips that you have to attend or drills that you must follow through with. These distractions take away from valuable class time.

Getting injured or sick is all a part of life. Plenty of students get sick and have to stay in the hospital and miss a lot of class time. The teachers will sometimes have work be sent to the student, but that doesn't give them what was taught. Online school would give them the chance of continuing their work and not fail. Some students get injured and need surgery. The issue with surgery is that majority of the time along recovery period is needed. The teachers will also have work be sent to them, but still won't help them a lot. Missing long period of school is not just associated with bad health, but can be from vacationing or moving a lot. Some students have parents who like to vacation fro long periods of times. The students loose important class time and it has a risk of them failing high school. Online school could help them stay on vacation, but have the chance to graduate. There are plenty of jobs that require a person to move a lot and sometimes the parents drag their kids along. The kids will have to continue to switch schools and they miss a lot of work and fall behind. Online school would make it be to where they don't miss school time.

In summary online school should always be offered. The reasons a student may have to online school will change, but they are valid and important reasons. The student who has anxiety can relax and pass their classes. The kids who is uncomfortable in a school environment can have a safe and familiar spot to learn in. The students who can never focus can have a distraction free place to learn. The students who are missing majority of the school year can now learn without the fear of failure. There are so many benefits behind online schooling.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
2379C4EA00DF,"Distant Learning

Many students dream of waking up in the morning and doing school from the comfort of their very own home. Sleep in, do your work when you want, eat at whatever time you choose, sounds great, right?

Well, what most people fail to understand is the difficulties that distant learning can bring to students. Distant Learing isn't as great as it sounds when you think about in a long term maner. Many students may have difficulties with distant learning. They may find themself no motivation, distractions, or simply just might not understand things. So even though it may sound great, it doesnt work out well for every student.

Motivation is a huge road block in distant learning. Being in your own home you may find no motivation to do school work. Many students may feel that there is more important things to do at home, or some may even just be too lazy to do what they need to do to complete acedemic activities. Studies have shown that teens can easily sleep half of there day away. With students able to do school work at home they wont find the motivation to get up in the morning because they no longer have to be up at a strict time; meaning students may find themself sleeping instead of doing the things they need to do. Some students simply may not have any one to push them to complete the things they need to complete at home, leaving the student to feel like it is not important to do the work.

Distractions may cause a huge issue with distant learning as well. Students can easily be distracted by many things around them. Family, friends, social media and home life are all easy distraction factors in every students life. Many of these things are already a distraction at public schools; therefore they may cause even bigger issues at home when there is nothing to ease their minds. Being at home students may feel as if there are not as many rules; meaning they can use there cell phones when they want, communicate with friends and family when they choose and may have a lot more time to get distracted by thoughts. Distractions are a easy way for students to not have their work completed and turned in on time.

Students may have a huge issue understanding directions and following rules when they can not have face to face conversations with the teachers to understand the things that they need to do to complete a task. Sometimes you may find it difficult to understand a tone or words when they come through social media, email, or text. Students tend to understand things a lot easier when shown a demestration in person or when they have talked through it with a teacher. Misunderstandments may cause a student to get a bad grade on a work sheet or test. It is much safer to speak through the work in person before doing it so a student can clearly understand a teachers expectations and boundaries.

These factors may cause a heavy weight to be dropped on a students grades; causing students to fail classes, turn work in late, have no communicatiomn with a teacher and even be held back a grade. Many students find difficulties with distant learning. They may find themself with no motivation, distractions, or may just not understand the work given to them. So even though distant learning may sound great, it doesnt work out well for every student. Students should not have the option of doing distant learning in grade k - 12. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
28EF3F88FB87,"Schools have different ways of educating people whether if they educate people with special need or not. Parent's have two choices to enroll their kid(s) in. They can either enroll them in a Brick and Motor or enroll them online or known as home school. The difference between Brick and Motor and home school is that Brick and Motor is more public, has a lot more people held in it, and has social interactions while home school isn't public, doesn't have a lot of people held in it, and there is not a lot of social interaction. Is home schooling really beneficial to students? Home schooling has its pros and cons, like if kid(s) have a fear of big crowds or loud noises. The pro is that there is little to no crowds and noises during home school, but the con can be that the student doesn't get the chance to conquer that fear of theirs. Overall home schooling is not really beneficial because students will not get the social interaction they daily need in their life, students may miss the chance to experience new thing happening around in school and will not try to get out of their shell.

Social interaction plays a big role when students are growing up. Social interaction can help students; get new friends, land a job they are trying to get, ask around for help, and to help them be independent. Social interaction can change people whether they are lacking the social interaction or not. If students are being home schooled they won't really get to experience all of the stuff needed in daily life. If students miss out on being social with other students it can affect the way they grow up. Brick and Motor school is not just to take classes and get done as fast as possible, it is also to help you grow and to experience somethings that are needed in a daily life before hand so students are not trying to figure it out later in life. Social interaction helps with also small things in life, like when students are asking someone a question of where something is or being a manager of a store and having to talk to an angry customer. It also helps out with students being able to talk ""properly"" and it also give students courage and may bring up their self esteem when they have good social interactions with people and to continue to keep trying. When students don't really get to experience it and they may try to socially interact and it ends badly, it can affect the student to may give up, and/or give them depression, or their self esteem about them lowers. Social interaction is a big role play in schools because they want the student to be the best version of themselves.

Experience can either be a good or bad thing. Experience, just like social interaction, helps us grow whether it is a good experience or a bad one. Experience also is the main point for trying out new things in life. Experience may not be as significantly important like social interaction for the things students need in life, for example when students have a good social interaction with people, they land a job to live the life they want, they get a good experience but if they don't have a good social interaction and don't land the job, they get a bad experience and may not be able to pay the bills or get the needs in their daily life. Even though it may seem it is not that important it still plays a big role in the students life and even as an adults. Experience is not really prominent in home schooling as it is in Brick and Motor schools. The reason why is because Brick and Motor schools have clubs for students so they can enjoy what they like or to just try new things and get out of there shell, they also have field trips for some of the classes and friends. Friends is experience because students can see who can tolerate them and if they can tolerate that person or another example can be that if one of the students fail an English test or any other courses that students friend may invite them over for a study session to help them improve on whatever they may be failing at and that is a good and bad experience. Even though most students don't like failing and try to avoid it, failing can be a good experience because it can teach them what they might be lacking in or so they can see what is their strength and weakness and will want to improve it, while having someone by their side to help push them along the way.

People or students may say that home schooling is beneficial because it can help students and parents save time and money to pick their kid up if they have an appointment and they can just pick right off where they left, but when students grow up they are not just going to have time to do what they want, they will be busy most of their life and Brick and Motor helps with that because students have to get on time to their classes. Home schooling can limit some thing or they just don't really have the materials for example students like hands on school work or projects home school doesn't have that. Even though Brick and Motor can't really prepare students every single thing for adult hood, they at least can prepare you a lot better than home schooling. Brick and Motor takes a lot more action to help students to become who they are and help get out of their shell. Even though a lot of students despise or hate school or any form of education that they don't want to learn, in the end a lot of them are grateful for what Brick and Motor has done for them. Home schooling lacks the thing like social interaction, the experience to go on trips or try new things, the hands on experience for students to learn better and clubs for students to enjoy what they like, may harm students in the future. Each thing in a school that one school doesn't have may seem like it is not really that necessary to have it and may not play a big part, actually has a big part to play in a students life. Brick and Motor school is the best and most beneficial for the students when they become an adult because home school cant provide the students what they need in life.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
6C4E27499B8F,"School could be a very intimidating place, or it could be a place of fun or comfort. No matter your preference you should be wherever you feel you can succeed and achieve your goals. And that is why students who attend classes at home could benefit more then attending an actual school. Students who attend classes from home could benefit more because they would have less distractions from other students, they would be able to move at there own pace, and also feel more comfortable in there own environment.

There could also be some benefits for students attending classes at school. Like socializing with other students and learning with others. Also extra curricular activities and sports. But if a student is not comfortable in there environment and feel like they are not preforming there best, They should not be there.

A classroom full of multiple students could be very distracting. There could be multiple things going on. For example kids talking in the middle of a lesson, or some type of noises. It could be very hard to concentrate on the teachers instructions. That is why a student learning from home could benefit him/her because it is just the student and the teacher. It lets them focus more on what they are being told and less of what is going on around them. It also allows them to take in every bit of the information they are being taught. It just makes it easier for the student to learn.

In a single class there could be 30 students at once. They are all trying to understand what they are being taught. But if you fall behind in a class of 30 students a teacher is not going to stop the entire lesson just for one person. That is why if it is just you there is no possible way you can fall behind because it is just you. There is no rush to gather all the information your brain doesnt have to be going 100 mph for one thing. It is your time and your speed. It allows students to fully gather the information in there head and process it fully so they understand. And it makes the student calm so he or she can fully focus without the rush of a normal classroom.

Learning from home is probably one of the best places you can learn because it is your home. It is a place you are comfortable in a place you know like the back of your hand. You know where everything is and you know everyone that is there. If you go to a normal class there could be things changing everyday somethings you might not like somethings that could make you uncomfortable. There are many things that could happen at a school with so many things going on around you and so many people around it can make you feel very uneasy at times. That is why learning from the comfort of your own home could make students more comfortable with learning and just being in there own environment.

A education is very important for everyone it is your ticket to great things and a successful life. And you should be able to choose where you want to get an education. And getting an education from home can be very beneficial. Students who attend classes from home could benefit more because they would have less distractions from other students, they would be able to move at there own pace, and also feel more comfortable in there own environment. Working from home can be more beneficial than from a regular school and could lead to more success in the long run.                                           ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
831456662FB5,"In 2020, new ideas are growing and new inventions are being made. One of those inventions are creating new technologies for our daily lives. Some people make technology for transportation, buildings, machines or entertainment. One of the other main things they use technology for is for education. There are some schools that let students have the opportunity to learn from home by watching videos or conferences. Learning from home versus being at school are very different. Students would not benefit from learning from home, proving that students would not get the full experience and atmosphere like in school.

One disadvantage of learning from home, is that students will not have social interaction with their peers. In public schools, teachers would have students talk and learn how to problem solve. Even though, if a student gains the knowledge of how to problem solve by themselves, there can be a case where they need support. By having other peers around a student, not only will they know how to find a solution, they can learn how to work with others. For example, in math class, students are put into groups and trying to solve a problem. The teacher does this activity, so they learn how to use critical thinking and combine their classmates ideas. This helps students know how to speak out their opinion and contribute to a group. When working in school with other students this will help them learn how to communicate and gain different ideas or opinions. This is beneficial when it comes to presenting an idea or topic when the student gets a job or being in an incident when there is a large group of people. Compared to being at home and having to rely on the internet and technology. This proves that a student can get the full experience when they engage with someone in person, instead of a laptop or device.

Not only will the student benefit from being with their peers, they can get direct feedback. Teachers will sometimes have students work together, but most of the time work alone. There are some students that believe they can get their independence at home, however, being at school will help students get their full support and feedback. An example, could be in an English class that is working on their essays. Before the class begins their final essays, teachers would have their students check their peers work to get feedback. Students would write comments or highlight errors on their peer's paper, so they would know what they need to change. This strategy of learning would help the student get direct feedback verbally and quickly. That way the student will know in advance what edits need to be made and can ask questions to their peer reviewer on their paper. This shows that when students are present at school, they can get the help they need without having to look up information online or wait for conference calls. The students will get more efficient access from being at school rather than being at home.

Being at home can take away the educational atmosphere that the student could be in the future. There are students that can graduated from being home schooled, but they would not get the same atmosphere like students who go to public school. The main goal of school is to help a student gain the knowledge they need to be on their own. Another goal for school, is to have the student know what it will feel like, if they go to a college or a work environment. For instance, a student that graduated from a public school would already have the knowledge of the educational atmosphere when they go to the campus. That student will be comfortable with other people around him and know what to expect from their professors. They will know that they would need to speak up in class discussions, work in a team, and have confidence in their opinions. Now that the student experienced that kind of atmosphere, they will know what to do. Video conferences or learning online may be useful in some ways, there are some situations that can go wrong. The student could have technical difficulties, if the website cannot load or if on a conference call, there could be trouble with the connection and not working. This supports that when a student is at school they are more able to get there full experience and atmosphere when they are at school.

Students would not get the support from learning from home, showing that students would not get full knowledge or learning environmental like school. Today there are more students that prefer to learn from home because of new technologies or learning tools. Which can benefit in different ways, but the full benefit is from being at school. By being at school, students can be with their peers, develop communication skills and learn how to be their own person without others interfering them. Not only will school boost a student's confidence, but will help them in the future. When they are interdependent, out on their own in a house or college and a working environment, that student will feel more comfortable and have that experience. All from being at school and being in a learning atmosphere rather than being at home.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
1C8C28FBE64E,"Have you ever met someone or know someone that does classes for school at home? Well, this is called home school or online classes. Many schools offer these program for children and teens. Some may say that online classes are not beneficial at all but I say it is. Online classes are beneficial because many children have health issues, they move to different places, and some children learn at different paces. Home school or online classes are beneficial to many children.

Firstly, many children have health issues that require them to stay at home. For example, a child can be connected to a medical machine that is require to stay in one spot or can be hard to move around. Therefore, the child must stay at home or at a hospital. The child somehow has to get an education, therefore, his or her parent can enroll the child to do online classes. Eventhough, the child is not in a classroom environment, the child can still learn by doing his or her courses online. Online classes are beneficial when a child can not access a classroom due to health issues.

Secondly, many children move to different places due to parent's job. For example, a child has parents that are in they army. His or her parents have to move to a different location that their commander has order them to move. The child will have to move to a whole new different school in order to keep getting a education, they will have to adapt to that new school environment, and be prepare to move again. With online classes the child will not be enrolled in any other school and go through paper work every single time they move. Having parents that move for jobs can be real difficult, especially for the child. With online classes they can move and still learn without the hassle of filling out paper work and adpating to a new school.

Thirdly, children learn at different paces. Many children need more time to learn specific subjects then others. For example, a child in a classroom can be behind than the other children in the classroom. That child is having a hard time keeping up and is struggling a lot. Well, with online classes the child can work at his or her pace and can get a better understanding of the subjects they struggle in. Also, the child can have contact with a teacher that can help him or her answer a question they do not understand. Online classes are very useful to help a child learn and not be rush to learn the material they need to learn.

Many have said that online classes are not beneficial at all. They say it's a lot to pay for materials the children need, the children don't do the work, and that children can stay with relatives while the parent moves. Well, I believe that online school are very beneficial to children because it helps children a lot when it comes down to education. All children are not the same and have different situations that requires them to do online classes.

In conclusion, online classes are beneficial to children because of health issues, moving, and learning at different paces. Not every child is going to have the opportunity to wake up in the morning and go to school, but with online classes every child is going to have the opportunity to have an education. So, when you think about why online classes are so important, think about how every child is not the same and some need more time to learn then others.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
B2FF6A761EC9,"As technology continues to advance and new programs are designed, there are many new ways to learn online. These avenues have developed to the point where some claim that they can achieve or even surpass the level of teaching that may be given in a classroom setting. Since most students don't enjoy attending class, this has been seen as a potential alternative throughout the college and high school levels. The students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it affords them ease of access, reduced stress, and lower costs of schooling.

The ease of access granted to students when the classes are at home could allow for more freedoms and the ability to carryout addtional activities outside of school. Students who live in rural areas or regions where travel may be difficult and time costly would be able to achieve as much learning as a classroom without the lost time trying to simply get to the school to begin learning. The timed gained by online classes could be utilized for students to join a sports program, help their families, or potentially land a job. Additionally, with the travel time eliminated, students would have additional time to sleep, which could lead to higher scores and better learning retention. While some students might not fully maximize the potential of the new time given to them, it would still afford them the opportunity to expand their horizons in other ways outside of school.

Students would benefit from online classes because it could help reduce potential stressors that they may encounter at school. For some students, the forced social aspect of school causes immense stress and anxiety throughout the school day, which could inhibit them from properly retaining the information being taught or the directions being given. However, if these students were able to study from home, they would be able to focus soley on the lesson plan without any additional distractions. Another example could be the reduction of opportunities for bullying to occur. Without having in-person classes, the physical aspect of bullying could be eliminated from the school system and help reduce the stresses students often carry from this issue.

Lastly, the overall cost of schooling would likely be reduced if students were able to attend from home. If students were all studying from home, the need for the school buildings and their subsequent costs could be eliminated. Additionally, the salaries required for the teacher staff could also be reduced due to the reduction of time spent teaching and the easier methods to reach a larger student body. These lowered costs could open possibilities for students who might not be able to typically afford the schooling, specifically in college level courses. While some might argue that the costs to obtain the technology necessary to attend online classes might still prove to be too much for some families, the school system could still finance those who truly need support, and it would still be a much lower cost than facillitating an entire school building.

As technology continues to advance, students should be able to take advantage of such improvements and take online classes in order to achieve more outside of school, reduce their stress, and be able to afford their desired schools. Some critics to this idea have stated that the value of a face to face education where questions can be asked and answers can be quickly given will be lost with the online system. However this is not true, because the new technology allows for conference calls between students and teachers that can afford them the opportunity to ask questions and receieve answers in a timely fashion. Online classes have excellent potential, and students should be able to utilize such potential to achieve their goals. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
0C699C871AA5,"Students will not be benefited if they attend classes from home by online or video conferencing because then they will not concentrate much on studies and will take studies lightly.

Students will not be benefited if they attend classes from home by online or video conferencing because then they will not concentrate much on studies and which will lead to bad grades. They will not be having test and quizzes often. They might become lazy and start copying each other work. If they do not attend school, then there will be less chances of students doing work sincerely at home. They will not be able to get proper education at home and there will be less communication with students and teachers. If there will be less communication then they will not be able to get more open with others. There will be no group work so that students can share their ideas regarding studies. They might start taking breaks often. There will be no routine for students for studying at home. They will not be able to concentrate much working at home due to lot of distractions like T.V, movies, videos games, text ting etc. If you will not get a better education you might not be able to sussed in life.

How much you learn and read more the better because learning and reading takes you around the world. Teachers should also watch every student more carefully because if a student is doing something wrong then teachers can help them and make sure they go in the correct way. Parents should also keep an eye on their student that how they are doing because if they are not then parents can also guide them.

699259F14D89,"Schools that offer distance learning is a open option for student's. Can it be beneficial for student's to attend school classes at home as well as video chatting for conferences? My opinion on this statement is distance learning is not beneficial, Certain kids take advantage of online schooling to not attend school and to stay at home. Most few kids can't learn their material through computer and prefer being in a classroom and being taught verbally. Everyone's learning skills are different.

Online classes are like books on a computer and having to learn all your materials on your own. Attending school will help you learn more things about all your subjects. When having trouble with any subject you will have teachers and other students to go to when needed help.

Distance learning may effect your social life. Socializing with other student's at school is a great way to make friends. Going to school and having a routine every morning will help you to be independent and having you'r own responsibilities, it will prepare you as you get older. Although waking up in the morning can be harsh and very tiring, you must think about the future you want to have.

School is where you have opportunity's for many things. Doing online classes won't be like going to school where they give you opportunity's to go on field trips and have fun at the dances or participating in sports and clubs. If attending school you can make childhood memories to tell and the long run.

Distance learning is not beneficial you lose a lot of opportunity's and enjoyments. I have to strongly disagree with doing online classes at home. Going to school is where you find yourself and start to plan the future that you want to accomplish.                       ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
4789DE789DB8,"School has always been a place of learning. It is a a place where teachers and students interact, paper tests and quizzes are taken, and life long friendships are made. However, all the new technology and new ways of learning from that new technology have affected what is done in the classroom. That being said, many may say that online classes or video conferences might be more beneficial and time manageable, but this is a debatable topic. I believe that attending classes from home would not be beneficial for students because it would allow them to be open to more distractions, prevent them from making friendships, and take away the ability to have face-to-face learning from the teachers.

When students are at home, there are a lot more distractions that could get them off track than when they're at school. Their cell phone and other electronic devices are right within reach, and there are not any teachers telling them to put their devices away. Students could also think that it is okay to skip the video conferences or not do the work that was assigned online; this could lead to worse problems such as failing classes because they fail to complete assignments or take assessments. To attend classes at home, people have to be very disciplined and have good time management skills. To be honest, most high school students and younger do not have that type of discipline. They get easily distracted and choose to do more fun activities instead of focusing on their schoolwork and studies. At school, students are in an environment where they are forced to do the work, and they get more done because they are also competing with the other people in their classes. This allows them to be more motivated to get work done faster and focused on what they have to complete. There are just too many distractions at home that could prevent someone from finishing what they need to and learning everything they need in school.

Attending classes online in the comfort of one's home may also prevent friendships that could have been made at school. One of the best things about going to an actual school is the people. The friendships that a person could make in high school could last a lifetime. Staying at home and taking online classes would only prevent the opportunity to meet all these new people that could be someone's best friends; why miss out on an opportunity like that? Sure, some people could make friends from other activities or sports that they do, but the friendships made in school are so special. The friends that someone could make through school are those who would go through the same struggles, emotions, and problems together. Classes from home might make someone feel lonely or bored because there would not be any interacting with people face-to-face. Talking online and in person are two totally different things.

Learning can especially be hard when teachers and students are not physically in the same room together. In order to optimize the amount of time and effort put into teaching a student something, a teacher needs to be able to stand in front of a board and do the work right in front of them while being able to answer question. An online course or video chat may not give a student all the attention and help that they need in order to understand the concepts that they are learning. Some may say that learning at home benefit the students more because there is less stress from the teachers and more time to self manage. This is true to an extent because a lot of people may procrastinate and become even more stressed when they miss a deadline for an assignment or their grades drop; this may be especially stressful because there is no way for the students to get immediate attention and help from a teacher if they are attending classes at home and online.

Overall, the amount of disadvantages to taking classes at home overrule the amount of benefits that there are. Students do better in an environment where there are others around them doing the same work. Students motivate each other to do better without knowing it, and that benefit is not something that can happen from online schooling and video conferencing. People feed off of each others energy and become more competitive at school, and it allows people to grow and thrive. School is a place of interacting as well, and it allows friendships to be made. There are just so many things that someone could miss out on and lose from attending classes only at home, and it really isn't worth missing all of that.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
58EBDB3621E5,"Students would benefit, from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. There are a lot of kids with disabilities who wants to go to school but they are afraid of being bullied by other students in school.

There are some parents who are in college, and have many responsibilities and still needs education. There are some other kids that needs to go to school but can't get out of their houses because of their sickness or health conditions.

The first reason why students would benefit from attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, is because of those kids with disabilities who wants to go to school ,but are afraid of being bullied because of their physical appearance. I remember when i was young , i used to get bullied in school because of my bow legs. Kids could laugh at me , and that used to hurt my feelings at the point of not willing to go to school.

This same thing is still happening today to a lot of kids in different schools , that they don't want to go to school because of being bullied and judge for their physical appearance yet they can't do nothing about it . That's why classes from home by way of online would be so important to kids who are going through this kind of situations.

The second reason is because of the parents who are in college and have many responsibilities, as taking care of their families and work, but still needs education.

Last year my sister had a baby, yet she was getting ready to graduate in college. She couldn't stop studying just because she got a baby. The online classes from home helped her a lot , because she was able to nurse her baby and take her classes at the same time.

The third reason is because of those kids that needs to go to school, but can't even dare get out of their houses because of their sickness. I had a friend who had a very bad disease that could't allow her go outside where there is sunlight because it could burn her skin. She wanted to go to school but she couldn't because of her health condition. The classes from home by way of online helped her finished her high school studies and graduated.

Some people may disagree by saying that students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online, because they won't have fun, make friends and other things, however i believe that they would benefit because a lot of those students who take classes from home by the way of online, ends up finishing their studies, and their wouldn't be any difference from the one who made it in school. Having friends and fun is good but ain't the priority , the priority is to get what's important and what will help in the future.

4A3AF3695873,"There are some schools that offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. By having the ability to attend classes online, students can avoid many obstacles that make learning difficult. Students can avoid constant distractions, as well as preventing outbreaks from getting into schools. While some believe having online classes as an option for students is not beneficial, it is abundantly clear there are many benefits to having the option for students to take classes online.

Having the option to attend classes from home can eliminate the constant distractions that students constantly face. A students' attention span is not fully developed while in grade school, so they can get easily distracted by their surroundings and fall behind. For example, when I am in Algebra, I tend to drift off when my class is taking notes because my attention span has not fully matured yet. When I get distracted, it is extremely easy to fall behind. However, by having the option to attend classes that students find to be difficult or distracting, they will have the luxury of learning at their own pace. Another distraction that students face is other students who do not take the class seriously. For example, when I am in Physics, I have a difficult time focusing. This is due to the fact that Generic_Name and Generic_Name purposefully procrastinate in a way to call attention to themselves. Having the option to avoid these situations by attending classes from home, has the potential to make learning more constructive.

Having the ability to take classes online also has the potential to prevent global pandemics, such as the Coronavirus. By having the ability to continue classes online or by video conferencing, school systems have the capability to prevent outbreaks from getting into schools. For example, about a month ago I was sick with the flu. I was out all week lying in bed the entire time. Little did I know that hundreds of other students were out with the flu that week. By having the option to attend classes from home, that outbreak could have been avoided. Imagine what would happen if the outbreak were to be the Coronavirus, or any other illness of that magnetude. If all schools were to have the option to attend classes from home, it would eradicate the constant distractions and prevent outbreaks and many other issues.

In conclusion, many believe having the option for students to take classes online from home is not beneficial, it is perfectly transparent there are many extraordinary benefits to having the option for students to attend classes from home. It can the potential to prevent global pandemics, eliminate distractions, and create a safe learning enviornment for all students around the world.               ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A0938A136F0A,"Students should not be allowed to take distance classes at their schools. Being at home, taking classes on a computer all day is not good for you. There are many problems that occur when you get no social interaction in real life. It is important to make coversations with people in person, the amount of work completed would decrease, and there would not be as many memories made.

The importace of in real life interaction is huge! There is a big difference between talking to someone face to face, and talking to someone over the internet. Many people are not scared to say whatever they want on the internet, while in person they are very timid or hesitant to express themselves. Making students go to school and interact with people helps them slowly break out of their shell and become more willing to talk to people. But if students stay at home and take classes and never talk to people, it would be nearly impossible to break out of that shell.

The amount of work that is completed and turned in would drop dramaticly. If you think about it students hardly do their homework, so why would they do classwork at home? They would not and this would lead to a drop in grades. A person that is for the distance classes could say that they could attend class even while they are sick. But even if that is true if they are too sick to go to school they will probably not pay attention to the class thats on their computer.

A big thing they would miss out on is the memories. There are so many times where someone messes up something and the whole class starts laughing, or the teacher assigns a fun class activity that makes the whole day better. You just can not get that same excitment of having fun in person through a computer screen. The worst part would be making zero memories with your friends in school. You can not talk to your friends in between classes and joke around because you would not be in the hallways. You would be behind a screen waitiing for your next class to start which is no fun.

When you think about the importance of social interactions and then think about distance classes it is really a no brainer what the answer is. Students need that interaction in order to develop important skills that they will use for the rest of their lives. So students need to keep going to school and take normal face to face classes.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
0CB3A4D9ABF9,"Everyday, students across the world attend school. Whether it's elementary, middle, or high school, millions of students obtain their education through learning. While many of these learners attend school in person, there are plenty of students who receive their education through online school. From video conferencing to special programs, these students do not physically attend school in-person. And with technology becoming more advanced and easier to use, many schools are beginning to offer these online learning services to their students, allowing them to learn from home. Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they would get distracted, and they would not be engaged with their learning.

One reason why students would not benefit from attending classes at home is distractions. While having the leisure of working from home, students would also have the convenience of the accessing internet. With pressing a few keys on a keyboard, a student can go from attending an online class to watching a movie on an entertainment service. Another distraction that could occur is distractions in the home of the student. A student could have younger siblings that often create noise and be loquacious, which could interfere with their education. Also, as a high school student myself, I can conclude that the most distracting item that I hold is my cell phone. Not only is it entertaining, it is also very convenient to use. With attending school from home, not only can students access their cellular devices, but they can also use them freely with no higher authority disciplining them. These distractions can be crucial on a student, as well as their education.

Another reason why students would not benefit from attending classes at home is that they would not be engaged with their learning. Students could decided not participate in their online class, and there would be no one to hold them accountable. A higher authority is needed to keep students on track with their learning. Additionally, if students attended school from home, they wouldn't have any fellow students to interact with. A teacher of mine once said, ""It is not only the education that you gain from attending school. It's the connections that you make with friends, and the bonds that you build along the way."" Without companions and friends to work with, students would not feel as compassionate about school. However, these connections are not limited to just fellow students; building connections with teachers is important as well. Teachers can provide advice to their students about schoolwork and life, which could help a student forever.

While students would benefit from attending school in person, there are advantages to attending school online. Not only is it convenient for the students, but it is also convenient for the students' parents. Many public schools are controversial for parents, and it is understandable that they would rather have their child attend school from home. Online school would also be beneficial for students with transportation issues. Instead of walking to school or having to drive a far distance everyday, they could learn from home without any issues. However, online classes would not be easy for everyone. For students without financial support, they might not be able to attend school online, even if they wanted to. Laptops and computers are very expensive, and to buy them the student will need a copious amount of money.

There are plenty of benefits of attending either online school, or school in person. Online school provides the student with the leisure of working from home, and attending school in-person creates bonds with friends and teachers. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home, because they would get distracted easily and not be engaged with their learning. As a high school student that has physically attended school for 11 years, I have built many friendships and connections with teachers and other students that has helped my life exponentially. If I had attended school online, I do not believe that I would be where I am today. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
CF28BC9A342E,"Most students from all around the world from all around the world don't have the ability to go to school everyday. They either live far away, their parents can't afford it, or they're just incapable of going to school. Now with today's technology, students can get their education and can get their work done from online instead of sitting in a classroom. Distant learning can be a big benefit for students because they don't have to worry about turning their work in late, they're still getting their education, and they still get their credits to graduate.

First, the students don't have to worry about turning in late work. When a student is not at school, he/she will miss a good amount of important lessons and important class work. When they come back to school, they will be a little bit behind from everyone else because the other students have moved on to the next lesson while you're trying to catch up on work and trying to learn the lessons that you weren't there for. But now we can fix that problem with using video conferencing so gthat the student can still do their work from home while the teacher can still give you the information from the video call. This can also be a stress reliever for the students because they are still caught up with the class and they don't have to worry about turning late work.

Secondly, the students are still getting their education. Many students are not able to attend school for various reasons. Which means that they are not able to learn about math, history, science, and english. With online classes, students can learn all of the main courses without going to school. For example, my brother used online classes for college because he lived for away from the college he was attending. He got all of his main courses finished for college and he only one class that he had to go to. Therefore, online classes can be a good resource for the students that are not able to attend school.

Lastly, students can stil get their credits to graduate. Students who graduated early used online classes throughout their high school years. They still recieved their credits to graduate and to go on to college. For example, a friend of mine was able to graduate early from her junior year of high school. She told me that she used a good amount of online classes during the summer so that she can stack up her credits to graduate early. I you really want to graduate or graduate early, online classes can help you recieve the credits just a bit quicker than school can.

Not all students need to use video calls or online classes to pass a class or to grauduate. But it's definetly helpful to the ones that are having trouble in the classrooms or to the ones that are not able to attend school. In conclusion, online learning can be a benefit to the students who needs with their education.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
201241D24A3E,"Distance learning is defined as online classes or video conferencing. In other words, it's homeschooling. Students who are enrolled in distance learning usually end up in that position due to life factors such as bullying, disabilities, or mental illness. The discussion of whether this is beneficial or detrimental to students is a gray area, with both sides making reasonable arguments. However, I personally am against distance learning. Homeschooling offers a controlled environment with little disruption, but it hinders a child's social skills. Although learning in ones household gives students more freedom in the day to move around when they want, they also have the freedom to ignore their responsibilities and not do the work. A student's concentration levels can increase, but staring at a screen for long periods of time can cause irritation to the eyes. There's nothing wrong with the idea of taking lessons outside of school, but to be aware of the issues with learning from home is necessary.

For starters, distance learning contributes very little to the social skills of a student. Imagine pulling a child out of school, away from their friends and favorite teachers, and plopping them down in an empty room with nothing but a computer and some scratch paper and telling them, ""This is how you're going to take lessons from now on"". Although this can be resourceful to students on the autism spectrum or other health problems, keeping them stuck inside a house all alone may do more harm than good. For example, an old friend of mine from Generic_City is home schooled. While they didn't mind it, they would oftentimes gripe about how unbearably lonely and depressed they were; they couldn't go anywhere, there was nothing to do and there was nobody they knew in real life to talk to. Students will be unable to engage in opportunities to interact with people around their age, nor can they participate in any events or extracurricular activities. As a result, they could grow up socially awkward or verbally impulsive, negatively affecting their chance at proper growth.

Secondly, the concept of students working at home can be difficult to manage. When a teenager takes online classes or video conferencing, nobody is making sure they're doing their assignments. Young people are lazy by nature; when a teacher or adult leaves the room, we lose focus and chat among each other. In a controlled environment this wouldn't be a problem, but with nobody supervising the student, it makes it easier for them to neglect their classwork and do whatever they want. When I took homeschooling for a mere three days, I did very little of my homework; I found the task boring and pointless, and eventually I returned to public school. Additionally, online classroom assignments are more time consuming and challenging than what public school has to offer. This only further discourages the student from applying any amount of effort into their classwork, especially if they cannot understand the subject.

Finally, the reason why distance learning is not as effective as in-school learning is due to how homebound students are taught. In today's age we learn with the help of technology, using sideshows and laptops to simplify lessons for the young. Students in public school, while relying on electronics for information, don't get as much screen time as home schooled kids do; taking online classes requires a computer. If a home schooled student spends this much time scrolling and clicking through each and every lesson, that would mean the average screen time they receive is twice more than what publicly schooled students are exposed to. As harmless as it may sound, staring at a bright white screen can cause irritation to the eyes, causing tension headaches or nearsightedness; it can wear out your back or increase the likelihood of suffering from depression or anxiety. I used to have an addiction to my electronic devices. As a result, I was cranky and miserable, and my eyes and back were sore from sitting hunched over my phone. If a student benefits from learning through a computer, there is nothing wrong with that. That doesn't mean, however, every home schooled child can afford to stare at a screen for hours a day without feeling physically or mentally drained.

We all want the best for our youth, but doing that requires the process of making difficult choices. Distance learning provides an opportunity for students, yet doing so may hurt their behaviors in secretive ways. Students--specifically those with mental disabilities--can thrive in a learning environment without the fear of being bullied, but it can prevent them from meeting new people in both the classroom and in an after-school activity. Homeschooling has a more controlled, less disruptive environment, yet with no teacher present it can give way to laziness. Technology makes learning easier, but for students who have to learn electronically everyday, their physical and mental health are at risk of harm. The solution to this would be to eventually enroll a child into public schooling once they're at an appropriate age; distance learning is effective to others depending on their character, but as they grow up, it's better for them to develop and flourish alongside students in their grade rather than by themselves.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
F59898110195,"In America, students are far from the top performing in the world, while time spent in classrooms is among the highest. The American Education System has gone mostly unchanged for decades. While the world evolves technologically and ideologically, American students are still stuck in a seven hour school day with primitive learning methods. Recently, however, some schools have began to adopt online curriculum that allow students to work from home. Online courses can benefit students by giving them a break from being in school, learning to motivate themselves, and preparing them for a future of technology.

Sitting in a desk for seven hours a day is not conducive to learning. By giving students a few days on online work per week, they will be more attentive and productive when they are in school. The same studies that show shorter work days are beneficial also apply to school days. Especially with children, many people struggle to sit in one spot and focus for so long. This can make the traditional school day very ineffective for some kids. Online classes, however, will allow for students to take break when they need to. These breaks can help to eliminate boredom, and help students to take in the material and finish their work. Additionally, The school environment may also be a stressful place for some students. By being at home, this may offer the comfort that kids need to work effectively.

After graduation, teachers will not still be there to push students to do their work. Many kids struggle with independence because they are babysat through school. the online courses will introduce the need for discipline and time management. These essential skills will be vital to the success of students. By overcoming the urges to slack-off or procrastinate, students will become stronger and learn to tackle challenges on their own. This will result in better performance in school, but also in the real world when it really matters. This ultimately adds lots of value to the purpose of school today: preparation for adulthood.

Just twenty years ago, computers in school were extremely rare. Today, almost every student and teacher have a computer in their pocket. Technology is the future, and schools should represent that future. Many colleges offer degrees obtainable entirely online and remotely. Additionally, many employers offer tele-working days where employees can work from home on their computers. The school system's inability to adapt to evolving trends will render students at a disadvantage after graduation.

As the world evolves, education should too. Online classes will offer a myriad of benefits to help students currently in their schoolwork and in their future careers. While some may argue that online classes will not be involved enough or offer too much freedom to students, they are missing the need for change. Schools cannot stay the same forever; innovation had outgrown the classroom. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D6B7EE7B040D,"Imagine for a minute that you are at school, on three hours of sleep with an innate ability to care for anything at this present time. You wish that you could just crawl back into your hovel and sleep for a few more hours. Despite your most earnest wishes, however, your required presence at school forbids such activities from transpiring. Luckily for you, there is yet a ray of hope. Some schools have begun to offer distance learning as a way for students to attend from home, usually via online means. I believe that students stand to gain from this alternate method of attendance. I think this because distance learning decreases stress on students, reduces bullying, and is a healthy alternative for students with social anxiety. Furthermore, distance learning provides the student with an enhanced ability to pursue self-education.

For many students, school can be the progenitor of a stressful and mentally debilitating environment. This, consequentially, leads to a decrease in a student's mental and even physical health. This negative environment is usually achieved though an overabundance of homework and classwork, as well as assorted busy-work and tight deadlines. Through that invention which is distance learning, students will have an option to choose a slower-paced working environment. When working from a computer, classwork and homework lose distinction, and just become ""work,"" as there is no assigned place to start and finish it. This alone would do wonders for the mental health of students. To use an example from my own experiences with distance learning, I have found assignments done online to be more enjoyable and less stressful than those done in a classroom.

Another factor that would considerably benefit student health is the drastic reduction in instances of bullying that distance learning would bring. For the uninitiated, bullying is when one person engages in harmful acts repeatedly and over an extended period of time against another person. Schools have only served to increase instances of bullying through zero-tolerance policies, in which the victim is punished equally as much as the aggressor. This also leads to students being afraid to report bullying, as they would also risk punishment. Distance learning would reduce bullying by putting ""distance"" between a bully and a victim of bullying. While cyberbulling would still be present, as well as an issue, it is considerably less damaging when compared to the verbal and physical confrontations that can be seen on school grounds.

Distance learning would also be considered a pious alternative of sorts for those students who do not hold social interaction in high esteem, myself included. While most students can be considered to be outgoing in one way or another, there is a large minority of students that range from being just generally introverted to having crippling social anxiety. Their needs are usually overlooked in most schools, where the social climate in many cases is best described as ""riotous."" The prospect of attending classes from home for these students would be incredibly enticing, and would be calming for them. To use another personal example, I often find myself to be more productive at home than I do at school, in part because of the disruptive social climate that classrooms have.

Perhaps the most consequential result of distance learning would be an enhancement in the student's ability to pursue self-education. Self-education is, unsurprisingly, when a student independently seeks out and digests information, whether it is needed for school or not. Self-education can also have a profound effect on students, whether by giving them a higher grade on a test, or leading them to decide on a college major based off of a topic that they find to be interesting. To use myself an example, I have been educating myself on matters of Astronomy, Military History, and Geography for approximately 7 years now. In that time, I have participated in three state-level geography competitions, the second of which ranked me as third in the state in knowledge of Ancient Geography. In Astronomy, my self-education allowed me to get full marks on almost every Astronomy-related assignment in school, and in Military History, perhaps my strongest subject, I have connected myself with various historians and am currently making inroads into publishing work of my own design in a Military Journal. With distance learning, myself and every other like-minded student would have more time to pursue these subjects.

In conclusion, it is my belief that students would benefit immensely from distance learning. Working from home would take students out of a stressful school environment, and by extension protect them from bullying. That same home environment would also be better suited for more introverted students, who might feel anxious while being in school. Distance learning would also allow students to better pursue self-education, which would have positive effects for them presently and also later in life. Overall, distance learning stands to enrich the lives of students, while also serving to better their mental and physical health.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F7693B02CA5B,"Imagine going to school to find yourself struggling in rigorous classes facing long-term stress when instead you could simply take it slow at your own pace and learn at home. Distance learning has been a new program schools nation-wide have been offering for children who prefer to learn online or through video conferences. I believe schools have made the right decision to make distance learning possible for those who struggle in public or private school or are too busy to attend schools. Therefore, every child will have an equal opportunity to learn regardless of their ability to attend school.

A famous YouTube star, Desiree, has explained her situation regarding online school in one of her most recent videos. When she initially went viral, she was still enrolled in public school and participated in sports. Desiree makes content based off of cosmetics, makeup, and clothing. Her YouTube career had begun before she knew it and she was more than ecstatic to start producing more content and spend more time on her job. Still being a Sophomore in high school however, was an ultimate drawback in her plans. Desiree still had to attend school and she found herself struggling to produce content whilst being enrolled in school seven hours a day. Desiree was fortunate enough to explain how she had found online schooling to support her educational needs while having plenty of time to pursue her YouTube career. She begins her school work early in the morning and finishes around noon while she has the rest of the day to make videos, promote growing businesses, and sell her merchandise. Desiree admits that online schooling has made her life much easier and less stressful.

According to statistics, one out of four children get bullied in a school facility and one out of three students suffer from social anxiety. This results in children having a low self-esteem, low academic abilities, and severe mental trauma. Children who get bullied oftentimes don't return to school and take long absences to prevent encountering their bullies. These children suffer on a day to day basis and cannot perform to their fullest abilities due to environmental dangers. Almost all of these students can perform academic excellence when given the opportunity to experience distance learning. They would feel more confident, interested, and comfortable when they aren't surrounded by people that put them down. Children who suffer from social anxiety feel uncomfortable and stressed when placed in new environments. Eliminating these factors by being placed in a familiar setting can make them feel far more comfortable in their academic performance. This is known as context effects. Students who are being tested in a familiar area perform better than those who are unfamiliar with their settings. On the other hand, school facilities have difficult instructors that fail to educate children appropriately. These instructors could be hard to approach and don't help students learn material efficiently. In distance learning, instructors are better suited for children that learn at their own pace.

Many could argue that distance learning has more disadvantages than advantages. A disadvantage could be taking away a student's ability to form relationships with others. Online school could potentially cut off a child's access to the outside world, making them feel somewhat trapped. Students could also miss out on opportunities and scholarships if they were to not attend school facilities anymore. Another concern is that students would be most likely to slack off when they learn at home because they're more prone to take advantage of their familiar settings. However, a child has numerous opportunities to get involved in activities outside home to create friendships and bonds. Taking part in clubs or sports, children could find themselves feeling satisfied with their connections to the outside world. Distance learning doesn't eliminate communication with others in general, it just gives them less of an opportunity. Students also have options to earn scholarships if they were to prove academic excellence or excellence in sports regardless of distance learning. It's a fair possibility children could take advantage of online schooling when they are placed in familiar settings but it could also benefit their performance and skill levels.

Distance learning should be available to a child if they cannot manage both education and a career, if school facilities decrease their performance, and if students find it easier to learn at their own pace. There's various amounts of advantages when it comes to distance learning and very limited disadvantages. Academic excellence should be the number one priority when it comes to a child's education. Having the option to learn on their own pace and feel comfortable should be available to almost any child that needs it. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
E774EAC59A72,"Schools have been around for a very long time, children would go to school, attend class and return home. What if there was a new way of educating students. Many districts in the U.S have started offering online classes for those who wanted to exceed or skip ahead of the rest of the class. I believe that being able to take a class online is a great idea because it gives students a choice whether to advance themselves in their education.

Taking online classes is relatively new, many students choose to take these online classes to either get ahead in their work or prefer taking classes at home because they are more comfortable learning in an environment they are comfortable in. For example, many students would take physical education online during the summer so they would have a free slot to take an elective the following year. A study shows that students who decide to advance themselves in their school work have a higher chance of getting into a great university. Students might also take online classes because they feel they would learn better and concentrate since there would be less distractions than at school. Taking an online class is also quite expensive, a regular class would approximately cost $400-700, not everyone can afford to take an online class. A professor took a poll of why students took online classes, and 40% of them said they do not feel comfortable learning in an environment that is full of distractions.

Signing up for an online class has many advantages, but it also has a few disadvantages. Students who take online classes do not get to work on their social skills which is very important in today's world. Social skills are a vital part of today's working world, having poor social skills will affect your everyday life. During an interview, if you are not confident and socially ready, they will not hire you. Another example of how having poor social skills can affect your day to day life is making friends or being in a relationship. Taking online classes have many advantages, but they will affect you later in your life.

In conclusion, schools offering online classes is a very smart idea, it lets students decide whether they would like to exceed and more ahead or stay with the rest of the class. I think more schools should offer this option, because not all students have the same goal in life. If one wants to become a scientist, he will take a class online so the following year he can take more science classes. I believe that being able to take a class online is a great idea because it gives students a choice whether to advance themselves in their education.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
EA7403CC3053,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students have a hard time paying attention in school and staying on time,but with online or video conferencing it should easier form them to get the work done and on time. Some people disagree that online or video conferencing will not benefit student because its not the same then being at school in a class. Although some people think online or video conferencing don't benefit students,it should be known that online and video conferencing do benefits students.

The first reason why online or video conferencing do benefit students when they are at home is because it will be easier for them to work. While students are at their homes doing their work it will be easier to be more relaxed and in a positive attuide when completing their classwork,or homework for a class. Students are always cramped up with book works and test that when they get home they don't have time to relaxed,but with online or video conferencing students can work in their work place nice in cozy while watching TV or eating. The next thing is when working from home is the work will be 10x easier because you will have extra help from your parents or whomever you are staying with. The next reason online or video conferencing benefits students is that students won't be so stress out. When students are in school they can get easily stress out because of all the work and testes that teacher are giving them. While in the cozy in their home students can relive their stress,after a hard of doing book work and classwork online they can go outside,read a book, or have a friendly conventions with their parents about their day. The next thing on why they wont be so stress out is because if they are doing online classwork, or doing a video conferencing the students can ask politely, or stand up in walk around if they fell a little bit cluster. The last reason students benefits online or video conferencing from home is because students get to work at their own speed. When students are at home doing their work they wont be rush by any teachers to get their classwork done a specific hour they will have all the time they need when doing classwork online. When students are working in their homes it will be easier for them to get the work done because they are working at their own pace and taking their time to make sure they get a good grade.

The final reasons why students benefit working at home online or video conferencing is because it can benefit the students and parents. When students are working at their homes they will have less distraction then if they were at school. When students are in school they will have a lot of distraction because they will be tempted to get up in play,walk around the classroom. or just roam the hallways,but if they work from their home they would't they will be focus on their work and studies. When students are working from their home they wouldn't have to worry about all that yelling and screaming because they will have peace in quite. The next thing that it will benefit students and parents because their children will have more work space to do their work. When at home doing classwork,test. or even homework the students will have more work space to keep up with all their things instead of working in a little desk with little space to keep their thing on. Students will have the luxury to put the papers anywhere on their work desk in near or even sloppy because can tell them what to do with besides your parents. The last thing it will benefit parents and students s parents won't have to get calls from teacher about their children's. Most parents hate when teacher call their phone about the littlest thing their child did or din't do, but when working from their home they won't have to worry about teacher calling their home because they can see everything their children's is doing. Sometimes parents can worry about their child safety so when doing online classes or video conferencing they won't have to worry about that.

Although some people don't believe think online or video conferencing do not benefit students,it should be known that that online or video conferencing do benefit students. Online and video conferencing do help out students a lot because with it they can learn at their own pace, have less people in their ears, relive all that stress they had, and easier for them to work. Lets be honest every student want to pass and go on to have a good life, some probably don't, but how can they do that when their multiple obsctal blocking their way when they are at school if they are at home doing online classes and video conferencing do you think that their will obsctal in their way they will be more focus and will be ready to work hard to get were they want to be in life.                  ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
90C32C97725A,"School can be draining for some students, constantly having to get up early in the morning and drive or walk to school. The pressure and anxiety of school can also be too stressful on kids, causing students' learning to become harder. Nowadays there are more options for a student's education like public schools or homeschooling. One option that some schools have is online classes, where students can learn from their home. This option is very useful and can benefit many students and here's why.

In this generation there are more and more students with mental health issues like depression and or anxiety. These issues can cause fatigue and stress the students out, making it harder for them to get their work done. My friend, Generic_Name, struggles every day to get his work done because being around strangers makes him very anxious. Online schooling can be very helpful and relieving for students like him though. With online schooling they can stay in the comfort of their home and not have to stress about other students around them. They also would not have to worry about getting to school either.

Aside from mental health, other students have difficulty focusing with other students around them. The noise from their peers could prevent them from getting their work done. My other friend, Generic_Name, has trouble staying focused in class because of how loud and crowded the classroom always is. Online schooling would prevent that though. Students like her would stay in the safe and quiet environment of their home, which helps them more to get their work done, rather than being in a crowded and noisy environment where it would be harder for them.

Though online classes are very helpful towards students and also a wonderful option for them, it does have a few cons. There will always be that handful of students that can't attend their online classes. Unfortunately not every student has enough money for computers or other streaming devices. Another thing that isn't available for everyone is wifi, not all students live in an area with strong wifi nor can they go out to a public place like a cafe to use wifi. Online classes would actually be harder for them.

Though not all, a majority of students can benefit from online schooling. More and more kids today have trouble going to public schools and getting an education can be difficult for them. There is more pressure from peers and teachers now than ever. Online schooling can change that though and help students get a better education while also being healthy and comfortable.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
CF9059F3EC39,"Oh the pleasure of public schools, don't we all just love it so much. We are so lucky to be in a generation where technology is evolving faster than lightning, and online courses are an option. Online courses gives kids the opportunity to take responsibility into their own hands, and learn from home. This allows kids to be able to do work when they are sick, or on snow days when they don't have to come into school. Don't think its that easy though, some kids benefit from having a one on one with a teacher, and some kids just need that social motivation to do their work. If you benefit from having one on ones with teachers, and subjects visually projected to you, then going into school is for you.

If you are a visual creature, and benefit from being in class, than online courses are not for you. Some kids need to be able to sit down and hear the words actually come out of someones mouth. My older brother Generic_Name, one of the smartest kids you will ever meet, but he needs that social motivation to succeed. He home schooled throughout elementary school and middle school, but it just didn't work out from him. He would learn from books and videos, and it was just hard for him to comprehend the subjects. He greatly benefited from being able to be physically be present in class, and to have someone actually teaching. He loved that he was able to hear the words come out of someones mouth, rather then reading them from a book. This shows that even if you have the opportunity to do online courses, it might not be whats best for you.

Teachers having the ability to be able to talk with you one on one won't just benefit you in your education, it can also have a great impact in your everyday life. There was this one kid named Generic_Name, he went to school everyday and didn't really do anything, he just went to school because he had to. In his personal life he was really struggling with addiction, and he just couldn't find the correct motivation to stop, or even start trying in school. One of his teachers finally reached out and asked him whats going on. Generic_Name decided to just talk with him, and let him know what's going on. His teacher was surprised, but he wanted to help this kid get his life back together. He told Generic_Name that he was strong enough to get through this, and if he just tried, things would get better. So Generic_Name did, he came in everyday, checked in with his teachers, and told them how his day was going. His teachers would just say positive comments that would make him feel good about himself as a person, and it made him think he had a chance to become better. Generic_Name started trying and paying attention, and with the help of he teachers he was passing the class, and he actually started to like school. This shows that this kid really benefited from coming into class, he even told this teacher that he wouldnt have graduated if it werent for him.

Kids are weird, and that's just a fact. Some kids like to isolate themselves from other people, and really like to focus on the task at hand. It can actually be distracting to be sitting in a class full of students, and to be forced to sit down for hours. Or have your friends constantly distracting you from your work, that's why some people like to take online courses. People like the fact that they have the ability to do work at home, and not be distracted be others. The opportunity for them to choose when they can do their work, and learn, is awesome to them. It takes great responsibility to create a schedule were you will go and sit down and get your stuff done, without any motivation from another person. It creates good life skills, creating a schedule for yourself and following it from a young age. The ability to choose is yours. You need to find out if you need that social motivation or if you can handle doing your work by yourself. If you know that you need a teacher to help you, and explain things in person, then you know going to class is for you. If you don't need that social motivation, and you like doing your work at your home desk or bed, than great, you found out what works for you. It's all preference, but the ability to be able to choose in this day and age is huge. You have the ability so succeed, weather your at school or not, it's up to you to become the best you can be!",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D52095AEF0B1,"Face to face schooling is more beneficial to students then online schooling. having an electronic tell you how to do your work is not the same as a teacher, Online schooling is much easy to cheat on, they may also only have to take classes every few days.

Learning through a screen is so bland with no emphasis. That is why building a bond with your teacher becomes very important throughout a year. Teachers work very hard to supply us with the correct information to succeed. Teachers take lots of well thought out time to plan throughout the year. Each day to them has a purpose, that purpose being teach the students what needs to be known and make sure they are succeeding. Teachers are responsible for the future of our nation.

Cheating in school is punished by bad test scores or even detention. However, online schooling has no way in tracking cheating or punishing cheaters. While sitting at home and taking a test, each student can freely search the web and use other electronic devices to cheat off of. While testing in school you have adult supervision, and everyone has a fair opportunity to succeed. People at home have the unfair advantage of no supervision and online resources.

Some may say that online schools can help kids be stress free, but all in all they are really only stress free because no pressure is being put on them to complete tasking and test by a certain time. Online schools are not beneficial to students in any grade. Without a face to face interaction things will end up being forgotten in days maybe even hours, and there will be no consequences or way of telling if there is cheating online.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EF23CA70CA1F,"Technology has evolved greatly in the past few decades. As a result, computers are replacing many traditional ways of performing tasks. Technology has allowed students to attend classes online. Many people are skeptical about the benefits of attending classes from home. Students would benefit from being able to take classes online because students can be more comfortable, work at their own pace, and be less distracted.

If students are more comfortable, then they will be more productive. Cars have adjustable seating and air temperature so that the drivers can be as comfortable as possible so that they can focus on driving. Many students complain about the cold temperature of the school and the stiffness of the chairs. It often leaves students feeling tired and cramped. If students are focused on how uncomfortable they are, then their mind is not completely occupied by their school work. People with stage fright do not complete their job as well as singers that do not have stage fright because they are nervous and do not like attention.

Students who are not comfortable in their own skin will not perform as well as other students because they are too nervous to ask questions or ask for help in front of their peers. If students can work from home, it erases the stress of looking a certain way in front of other students. Taking online classes allows for a more relaxing and comforting environment.

Allowing students to work at their own pace will benefit them. In the movie ""RV""

, a family goes on vacation and meets another family who home schools their children. The kids that are home schooled are much farther ahead than the kids that go to public school. The kids that work at home are able to learn the curriculum at the pace best suited for them. They do not have to worry about what other kids are struggling with. When people are running races, they go a comfortable speed that they can continue running for the whole race. This is so that they do not burnout at the beginning. It is the same way with students. If the teacher is instructing at a speed too fast for a student then they put all their effort into the work in the beginning then struggle to keep up. Taking a class online will give students the opportunity to work at a comfortable pace, allowing for students to create the best work possible.

Less distractions will increase a student's focus. When a soccer player has to take a penalty kick if a game is tied, the crowd is not supposed to yell and scream so that the player can have a clear mind. With a clear mind, they are more able to complete their task. Often times, students do not have a clear mind in the classroom because of the other students. It does not matter if they are inside the room talking with their peers or outside the room walking down the hall, these other students will take someone's mind away from the task at hand. When kids are first learning how to drive, they are told to not listen to the radio or drive their friends as a way to limit distractions. They might not notice important road signs, turns, or other cars. Students need to have peace and quiet to give their schoolwork complete focus, just like driving. They could miss important information like instructions given by a teacher. Distractions created by the classroom lead to less concentration that could be increased by taking classes online.

An argument against online classes would be that students are less motivated to learn if they are not in a classroom setting because they do not feel forced. When students are in the school building, they have to do the work assigned by the teacher while in class. They cannot opt out and do the classwork later. If a student is taking a class online and gets to pick when they do their work, then the student might become lazy and procrastinate, resulting in lower quality work. A rebuttal to this would be that while that is true, an online class will prepare students for college. In college nobody is forcing the students to do work and nobody is going to stop a student if they choose to not do assignments. It is the student's responsibility to do their work and an online class could help prepare people for that.

Being more comfortable, working at their own pace, and being less distracted are all benefits of students being able to take classes online. Parents and teachers just want kids to get the best possible grades. This could be a great way to help students raise their class scores. Students are the future leaders of the world and this could help them be as educated as possible.         ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

3B888FC510B1,"Every year school gets harder for students, high school in particular is the hardest out of all. I believe students should have a choice on how they want to learn. Students should be able to choose weather or not getting an education from home or from the school is the best way for them to succeed. I think distance learning is helpful to certain students but, not all. It provides for a better mental health, better self-esteem, and improved attendance.

Majority of teenagers struggle with self-esteem, body confidence, and confidence in general. High school is a very judgmental atmosphere, the girls are mean, and the boys put on a front. Most of the kids do not feel safe coming to school without being judged by another group of students. In today's society every teenage girl wants an 'hourglass' body shape, but unless your last name is Kardashian it does not come naturally. Often girls starve themselves to technically fit into society's perfect body image. This causes girls to shame their own bodies as well as other high school girls, calling them ""too fat"", or ""too skinny"". Other times girls might try to be somebody they are not and compare their selves to another girl they may think is a definition of 'perfect', this may lead to personality changes, attitude changes, and character trait changes. Some students may not want to be around or in the high school environment due to self-esteem issues, which may lead to them needing distance learning which will provide a better environment for themselves.

Distance learning may provide students with a better mental health, most highschoolers face depression. Students may be bullied or feel like they have nobody in their corner for them when they are at school. Teenage boys feel like they need to hide their emotions and put on an act when they're at school. They may think that showing their emotions makes them not as 'manly' as they are told they need to be. This causes these high school boys to suffer in silence. At home students feel safer, they might have an adult at home with them that they can talk to, if they are feeling down or even a pet to lay with while they do their school work. It is proven that animals help with anxiety and help humans feel more at ease when they are stressed. Students don't have to worry about feeling judged or bullied at their own home. Overall distance learning will provide students with a chance of feeling like they are in a safer environment mentally, at home rather than being at school.

Distance learning will provide students with a better attendance record, students will be able to start later on the computer and end later. Providing students with a better nights of rest and letting students learn on their own time while staying within the curriculum. I know a lot of students struggle to make it to school on time or to even show up to school, including myself. Students may struggle to get to the bus on time or struggle to wake up when their alarm goes off. If students are already at home they have no reason to get ready or no bus to catch. If the students are aloud to begin their classes on their on time while following the schedule it will allow them not to feel as rushed as they would at school. In high school students have to run to their next class to make it on time where as if you were doing online school you may only have to go to the next tab, stay within that website, or even just open up a new word document. Therefore distance learning will help improve highschoolers attendance and tardiness.

You may be thinking. what if the student slacks off and does not complete their online courses? Well that is why I feel you have to be extremely responsible while doing distance learning, if you know you are a student who procrastinates or does not turn in stuff on time, attending school may be better for you. I believe that the student who is doing distance learning has to be responsible with their work and once they slack off it is mandatory to attend school until they prove they are capable of doing distance learning. There is always pros and cons to every situation but I feel that in this certain situation their are more pros if anything. Students should always have a choice in how they want to receive their education, I believe distance learning is the most effective and efficient way to learn.        ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
9414386BFE05,"Imagine learning everything from chemistry to world history at home on a computer screen. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would be assigned homework, classwork, quizzes, and tests all from an online instructor. Instead of learning in a normal classroom setting, students would watch videos of their teacher or read online notes. If students attended every class at home it would not be beneficial because students who were less indpendent may slack off and they wouldn't be exposed to the social factors that come from attending a regular school.

Many students struggle to pay attention in class or they do not have a very strong work ethic so it's important that they have a teacher there to push them. If they were given the opportunity to attend classes through a computer screen their bad habits may become worse. At home students can be distracted by other screens, younger siblings, pets, and many other things. Attending a normal school limits the amount of distractions a student would face at home. When a student begins to lose focus a teacher is there to remind them to finish their work. However, at home the student may not have someone hovering over their shoulder to make sure that they are absorbing the content.

Also, online schoolong limits the amount of exposure students would have to social situations. In elementary school, students learn more than just spelling and fractions but social skills as well. If a first grader were to take classes online they wouldn't understand how to raise their hand, wait their turn, or share their markers because it would be just them and a screen. In middle school, students would miss out on navigating busy hallways and playing a sport for their school. In high school, they wouldn't be able to participate in honor societies, clubs, or hands on classes. Many students take architecture, film, art, and agriculture classes to discover what they want to do after high school. However, each of these classes require hands on, expensive equipment that most students wouldn't have at home. Online schooling would limit the type of classes a student could take. In addition, many exploratory classes require students to work in teams to solve problems and work on projects. Online schooling would hinder a student's ability to work collaboratively.

Some may argue that online schooling is a better option for students who like to work at their own pace. Some students take a longer time to digest content than others so having their classes online would allow them to spend more time on areas that they struggle with. In a classroom setting, if a single student was struggling but the rest of the class understood the teacher would likely move on. In the same way, online schooling would allow students who move at a faster pace to breeze through material that comes naturally to them. Overall, online schooling would allow students to tailor the pace of their classes to what benefits them best.

In conclusion, online schooling may prevent students from finishing their work and learning the necessary social skills however it would allow them to work at their own pace. Students who are less driven may fall behind in their work because online schooling wouldn't provide any reprecussions. Additionally, students wouldn't benefity from the social situations that come from attending a regular school. Lastly, students would be able to determine the pace of their classes instead of relying on the levels of the students surrounding them in a classroom setting. Online schooling has some benefits however attending a regular school would be more beneficial especially during the developmental stages of a child's life. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
546B079DDC60,"Online classes are the new educational advancement for millions of aspiring students to succeed. In the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the population of both primary schools and colleges/universities, which has caused many school campuses to become overcrowded quickly. However, their are many other issues that students attending these schools continue to face such as not being able to attend school or less interaction with their teacher. The issue is extremely complex and challenging for all of those who encounter it, but the solution for this requires an innovative method; online education/classes. Students would benefit from taking online classes at home because students would be provided with a more comfortable environment, receive help from teachers more easily, and students who suffer from sicknesses or disabilities have an better way to obtain their education.

Attending an online class is beneficial for most, if not all, students because the students are able to learn in a more familiar environment that provides less distractions. The students taking the online class are less likely to become distracted during the class because the other students are not visible because only the teacher and lecture are presented on the screen. This offers students a better chance of retaining information while attending an online class. Mean while, an on campus class offers a less likelihood of students being able to retain important information. Although, social interaction may be altered due to classes taken at home, students will have the chance to interactively learn using a different form of education. Taking an online class would also provide more safety for a student both emotionally and mentally due to a significantly less chance of an active threat or physical bullying. With an increase of active threats, such as ""school shooters"", many students may prefer taking a class at home rather than at school. Overall, the utilization of online classes would drastically increase a student's performance to retain or learn information, while providing a more comfortable environment than on campus education.

Classes taken from home would benefit both the teachers and the students simultaneously. Across the United States hundreds of thousands of students need help from teachers whether it be homework or a misunderstanding on a subject. The ability to take an online class provides a better chance for a teacher to respond to multiple students questions at a given time. For example, the professors teaching the online class may establish a video conference where students may ask questions or for help. This is an extremely useful method that could benefit those who take an online class more than those taking an on campus class. Another reason of why this method would be successful is because thousands of schools across the country including Generic_School utilize this tactic. Studies show that learning in an environment where hundreds of questions can be asked on the information presented, at any given time, will help foster a better understanding of the information for the student. Furthermore, the usage of video conferencing/ online classes, that are taught by teachers, will benefit students due to a more accessible option of asking questions and receiving help.

Millions of students around the world are sick every week and are often challenged with the work they miss. The best use of online classes is clearly seen by those who are sick or those who suffer from disabilities because their access to on campus classes may be impaired. Students who are sick often stay home from school, however their are a few exceptions of students who do not whether those students have a test that day or other activities. By creating online classes for students the spread of sicknesses among not only student, but all types of people can be averted. The online class system could also be used to help those who are handicapped or disabled learn in a less challenging environment. An example of this is students who are in wheel chairs because when a class switches to another the students may have difficulties reaching their next class. By utilizing video conferences with teachers at home this issue could be solved easily. In conclusion, the implementation of online classes to students would allow the disabled and those who are sick still attend classes.

Students taking online classes would benefit from it many different ways depending on the circumstances. The utilization of these classes will create the future of education in the United States and the world. Examples of why these implementations work are scattered throughout the American school system. Overall, the utilization of online classes/ video conferences would benefit those who are sick or disabled, those who do not feel comfortable or have difficulties learning at school, and would allow more students to receive help from teachers, while lowering the work load for teachers.            ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9D780EA82AD3,"Online school can be beneficial in many ways, but is it worth it? Many students take online school, but aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe that online school is beneficial because of how flexible it is and the amount of work the student is required to do.

Going to school can give you more practice on life skills such as communicating. In school kids are prepared with communication skills such as working with other students on a project or communicating with their teachers about a missed assignment or a missed test. Communication is used everyday in life. While in school from K-12, students are taught to communicate what they want and what they need. Students are taught to communicate if they need help, because if they don't it is a downward spiral to their learning. Communicating is very important in working with others and in the work foce, without that important skill, life becomes very difficult.

Going to school also provides the skill of collaborating. Many kids who go to school receive more practice through school work and presentations. Whether it is just working with someone on class work or even working on a presentation. Many teachers will assign classwork, or projects that give the student the option to work with another person or alone, but sometimes the teacher won't give the option to work alone and make it mandatory that you work with another classmate. Working with another student gives the students the opportunity to both take their ideas and put them together to complete the task at hand. Collaborating in school gives the student the practice they need when they enter the real world. Collaborating is very important in life and is used everyday, especially in the workforce.

Others believe that online school is best for a student, because of the flexibility it gives the student and the amount of work the student is given. Taking online school gives the student the freedom to work on their own schedule throughout the day and turn in work when they want by the time the work is due. Online students are also give the opportunity to have more breaks, where as going to school the only break the student gets is lunch time. Online students have the flexibility to wake up later and work to their speed. While students in school have a set time to arrive at school, what time to go to certain classes, and how fast they gotta work. The workload compared from online school and in school are very different. In school if a student has an assignment done, the next thing they know, they have another one for them to do. On top of that students usually go home with homework after that. While online schools work load is far less. Once the student completes their lesson for that class they are done for the day.

In conclusion, online school has many benefits such as flexibility and work load. While going to school has a far greater benefit, with preparing the student for the real world with life skills such as communication and collaboration. Many students take online school, but they aren't getting the important skills they need in life such as communicating and collaborating, others believe online school is very beneficial because of how flexible it is and the work load being much lower than going to school. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7D83374556C1,"Knowledge is power. This phrase holds true even till today, and will most likely hold true for all of eternity. The more knowledgeable a particular person is, the more power they posses. Now it is no mystery that the public school education system has and is failing many of this country's youth, but what is a mystery is how to solve this conundrum and fix America's public education system. One of society's most powerful tools is the internet, so why not use it to help educate our youth? Some teachers have seen this resource and decided to take advantage of it and help educate their class with various online videos and websites. But why not take it one step further, and use this marvelous resource to our advantage and help teach students online? Some schools have taken the initiative to do precisely that, and now offer classes online for students to take, also known as distance learning. Distance learning benefits students by allowing them more flexibility and versatility to learn, adds more positive options for learning, and removes certain restrictions and concerns that come from having to attend a physical location for an education.

Life is extremely unpredictable. Anything can happen that might withhold a student from being able to attend school, ranging from a fatal car crash or something as simple as pressing the snooze button a few too many times. Sometimes life dictates that going to school isn't going to happen. By allowing students to move the classroom from their classroom to their house, they are able to have more flexibility and versatility in their lives and receive the proper education they require. Online classes makes getting an education easier for students. Why wouldn't that be a positive? If classes start at 7:30, students may have to wake up as early as 5:00 in order to get themselves prepared for the day. If a student doesn't take the bus, online classes free up the students parents, and allows them to have one less responsibility in their, possibly, extremely busy day. It also saves them money, whether it be for gas or for a taxi. It frees up the student, by giving them the opportunity to not have to get dressed. It may take 30 minutes or even an hour for a student to shower and get dressed, but by removing this routine, that is an extra hour that the student is able to sleep. Many argue that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but by requiring students to attend a class somewhere else, many students sacrifice eating, in order to arrive to class on time, yet online classes can help students enjoy the benefits of breakfast. Online classes make students lives more flexible and versatile by allowing them to decide when to take the class.

One could argue, that the internet is the greatest resource available. Unlike a book, information on the internet can be updated and corrected, without having to print and buy an entirely new book. The internet is also free, and provides various explanations that can cater to various different people and their learning styles. But many teachers restrict their class, by not taking advantage of this marvelous resource. While in class students must learn by any means the teacher uses, and if the teacher fails to explain a certain topic, the student suffers. In class, students can not search up a subject on the internet, it would most likely be a disaster if they could. Many students don't even ask questions, because they are afraid of humiliation, and if they do, they do not continue to inquire if they are still confused because they don't want to frustrate their teacher or look unintelligent. With the internet, this doesn't occur. Users are able to ask the ""dumbest"" questions imaginable, free of judgment. It also allows them to be more thorough, thus allowing them to better understand the subject and content better. All of this is possible with online classes, because students can rely on the internet to get accurate information, explained to them in a multitude of ways. If they don't like one websites explanation, they can look at another. The internet provides a variety of different websites to learn from, thus, allowing more options for students. Some could argue that a person could teach better than a book or website, and while this is true to an extent, online school doesn't remove the teacher, it only allows for another option, which is always a positive. If students still want to go to class, they still can.

Having brick and mortar institutions comes with its restrictions. Whether it be a bank or a school, having institutions online makes life easier. Classes are held at a certain time period, and while this may be a plus for some, this definitely comes with restrictions. If a student doesn't arrive on time or misses the day, there is nothing more that they can do. With online classes, students are able to still learn and possibly learn even better than in class. Another issue many schools face is harassment, and online classes can help with this as well. Even though it is important for students to learn how to act and react in social settings, if a student is being harassed by a group of students, they now have the option to be able to avoid them altogether. A classroom is restricted by the teaching style of a teacher. If students aren't compatible with a teachers teaching style, they have to figure out a way to solve their problem on their own. Online classes remove the middle man, and allow students to learn on their own.

Education is vital and key to the success of any nation. If humanity hopes to survive, it must be able to adapt and learn to evolve the systems already in place to try and improve society, such as the education system. By using one of humanities greatest accomplishments, the internet, schools can vastly improve, in turn, improving society as a whole. Distance learning is beneficial because of the flexibility it allows, the opportunities it offers, and the restrictions it disables.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
C9DD23612CF3,"Do you think students would benefit from learning from home? in my opinion I would say yes. I think distance learning is a smart and good thing for some students but there can be some cons. Not everyone is going to make it to school everyday so here are my reasons why i support this.

Imagine being sick and you can not make it to school. Instead of missing the lesson that was taught in class that day you can look up the lesson online. Of course it's not going to be the same, you will not get the same physical help as you would in a class room. But at the end of the day at least you're not missing a lesson and when you do come back to class you wont be behind with work and will be caught up just like everyone else.

For some students I feel they maybe would need their parents around to keep them going with the online class. I only say this because since you are learning from home there is no teacher to really pay attention on you and most teenage kids are always on the phone now a days and its a big distraction. So I mean there are going to be cons to having classes online. Therefore the parents have to be involved with this too. Before every online class take the student phone away or take away anything that distracts him/her and give it back to them when everything is completed.

Other than that I like and support online classes. It just all depends on the student, to be honest everyone learns different. Some kids like one on one help other kids can learn just by reading. It all depends on the student I personally think it's a great thing though if you could not make it to school because vacation, being sick, or you just dont feel like coming in. You don't have to worry about it everything that was taught in class will be online. All you have to do is take time out of your day and just get online and go through the lesson. I personally think this would benefit certain kids and it's a great thing.          ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
1C125837DEEB,"Having a classroom from the comfort of home has always been an idea floating in people's head. Different from home schooling, online classes or sessions can now be done through technology. Now, video conferencing can and is being used today in colleges and other places around the world. could be very beneficial to students because it can be less stressful and they won't miss any lessons.

Online classrooms should be less stressful for students. They won't have to deal with as many policies as they would in a normal facility. For example, dress code, library, and after school violations should immediately be out the window. Another reason why it could be less stressful is because they won't have to deal with as many people. Cyber bullying is still going around, but there shouldn't be any physical bullying. They also won't have as much drama as they would in school, which could result in better focus on their tasks. It would help them get better grades with less stress.

Since the classes are online, they shouldn't miss any lessons. They will have an entire day to work on an assignment that would most likely be due the next class. An entire day is more than enough time to get everything done for one class. Even if the students are sick, they won't miss a lesson. They won't be marked absent and wouldn't have to do any make up work, they will already have the lesson there for them.

As stated before, they ""shouldn't"" miss any lessons. Occasionally, students procrastinate and won't get work done. They like to do other things that grab their attention, rather than work on an assignment from a teacher. The fact that classes would be online shouldn't restrict students from getting assignments done. They still have their responsibilities to take care of. There are no excuses.

Online classes can be beneficial to students. It can be less stressful and they won't have any days off. They will still have their responsibilities, as if they were in an actual facility,to get their work done. There would be less problems and more time for them to do their work. Students should be able to stay on task and be in the comfort of their home. If the school board were to make this change, it would be very beneficial to students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
32D9054C3246,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have school on weekends? for many kids, it would be a nightmare, but instead of being physical, kids could be communicating and getting work done on the weekends through technology. Schools can offer distance learning as an option for students to attend school from home. This can benefit kids by making it easier to access the materials using websites such as Google classroom, and having less homework because even if they are sick, they can still ""show up"" to class even if they are not at school. Many kids could see this as an issue though, if school systems use this as a way to make kids continue to do school work on their days off (snow days, weekends, long breaks) it can tire them out. But, in turn, this could make the school year shorter, and give the kids a longer break for summer.

It can be useful if a student goes away on vacation, because they can still at least check up on the work that they've missed if they miss class. If a student is sick, they can make up work a lot easier, especially if they do not have to print out and missing pieces of classwork, useful if they do not have a printer at home. Coupled with the fact that more and more schools are giving out laptops to their students, the issue of people not having access to technology at home will not be an issue to anybody, because they should have access to the school-given laptops. Some people may say this is a bad idea because students can stay home more often from school, and while they are right, What isn't stopping them now, won't stop them when this is implemented, some people dont change.

This can prevent students from having homework because even when they are absent, they can still ""show up"" to classes. They might not be heard, or there could be an option to turn on and off a microphone when they wanted to answer questions in class, so they will feel involved. This can be really useful for students because it will free up time on weekends of after school for sports or other activities that take up time, while still putting school first. and to make sure students still show up to class, you can implement an attendance policy for the online class. Say, they don't log in, but dont show up to school, they can still be marked as absent, unless they have a note to get out of it. Many people may say that implementing a tardy/absent policy to being sick or away from school is wrong and they could have a point. But most of the time, Students will still show up to classes, and it may be easier this way to avoid embarrassment if they have anxiety or another type of disorder like I do.

Weekend classes, the bane of everyone's existence. many people would like to not have to think about school on weekends, due to it being down time. But many people could possibly benefit from having school on the weekend by using it to make up class time they could have possibly missed during the last week. It can also be used to shorten the school year and give students more downtime for spring/summer. Students can benefit from this by having a longer resting period before school starts again, While still learning the same amount in a condensed (but similar) Length of time. if students do use this time it can be very beneficial for them so they can learn better, many students seem to be able to focus more if they do their learning on computers or other devices. Thats why online colleges are so popular as of recent times. Many students may say that they do not want to sacrifice their weekends for a shorter school year. While I agree with that, I feel like it could definitely benefit in the long run by making school years shorter and making breaks and vacations longer.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F7EEB04BEE8D,"Many students would rather do school in the comfort of their own homes. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from at home classes because they will become lazy, they will be distracted, and they will not have enough guidance.

First, schools should not allow education at home because of the students future. Many students would rather sleep in than go to school. Allowing education at home, students will be less likely to get up and get motivated. This will cause issues in the future with their work ethic. Sleeping in late and not getting up to do school work now will cause students to not get up and go to work later in their lives. Online classes can also effect a persons social skills. There will also be less involvement with other people because they have been in a house and not with students in a class.

Second, schools should prohibit education at home because students will be easily distracted. Electronic devices is a popular thing that causes multiple problems in todays society. Many schools prohibit these devices so they do not cause any distractions. Cellular devices and televisions are a huge part of childrens' lifestyle that will effect the work of students from home. Video games is a very popular electronic device that children will sit on for hours and not get up to do any work.

Third, schools should not allow education at home because they will not have enough guidance. Although, some people may think at home education is more efficient because they can do other things at once and get more tasks done, there is not enough help at home for the students to do the work by themselves. When a student comes to school there is multiple teachers to talk to and guide you through the work. Online classes have more issues and are more difficult to comprehend because there is no physical help.

Furthermore, distance online learning is being offered for students to attend classes in their own homes. Schools should prohibit at home classes because it causes less effort, more interruptions, and not enough help. Education is an important part in lives, and not getting enough from online classes is not tolerable. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
0F7DB6BD1AD5,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done.

students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking.

students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases.

students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time.

Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise.         ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
CC93F09080FF,"There are many ways of gaining an education, but a more modern way of learning is through online schooling. In this era of time, technology has advanced to a point where one can do many things with the use of a device. In this case, obtaining an education is now possible through a glowing screen. Students who choose to take online classes now have a choice of learning on their own via the internet or by taking part in video conferencing with professors/ an educational aid. Of course there are pros and cons to this system, but it all depends on the type of person that the student is, the situation that they may be in, and the type of education that they are aiming to pursue.

The type of person that someone is reflects the way that they work. For example, if a student is known to be lazy, unmotivated, and distracted, then online classes probably aren't the best option to choose because: if they're lazy, then being at home is one of the worst places to do work because it's one of the best places to be comfortable, and as a child when one is comfy, they tend to sleep and dismiss their lessons; if they're unmotivated, there's a low chance that being at home will give that student motivation to do any work simply because of their enviornment; and if they easily get distracted, being at home will give them a higher opportunity to find something to take their mind off of their schoolwork, thus incompletion. Given these characteristics and examples, it is most likely that this student will find interest in anything but their education. On the other hand, if a student is described to be concentrated, consistant, and determined, there's a higher probabilty that they will excel in completing their online work because of the type of mindset that they have. But if a student is half and half, it is advised that they physically go to school just to reduce the possibilty of inconsistancy when at home. The way that a student is or acts determines the type of education that suits them best.

Another factor to whether or not a student could benefit through online education are the types of situations that a student may be going through. Put into context, if a student is going through personal issues and would rather be isolated than to be around a crowd of people, then online schooling might be the better option for them. They would have their closure and a better surounding for their path of focus. There are also some children that undergo disabilities that prevents them from learning at the pace that average students would, making it harder for them to cope in the school enviornment. If they took online classes, they could go at the pace that they desired without the pressure of keeping up with other classmates. They wouldn't have to deal with getting to class on time either because they get to decide when they want to do a lesson. If a student is unfortunately forced to provide for themselves through a job, taking online classes may be the most recommended choice of learning so they can attempt to balance their proffession with their education. In opposition to these types of events, if a student didn't know how to use a laptop, phone, or tablet (etc), then online schooling would become a lot more complicated for them. Or if the internet and/ or all technological devices happen to collapse, then a student might want to plan on going to actual school or one-on-one learning because, well, that's the closest efficient alternative if this phenomena were to happen. Situations vary, so it is up to the student to depict what will affect them positively for their gain of intelect.

The type of education a student is aiming towards are better if taught through a certain source. For example, when learning something that tends to be more complex, like math, it's better to be in an actual classroom because of the type of area, where a teacher is present. If a student were to take online classes with this course, questions can't always be asked, especially if there is no conferencing for anyone to answer. When in confusion, their next option is to look up their question on the internet, but not every source is relaible, so how will the student truly know what is right and what is untrue? That's why it is better to have a professor or qualified teacher be accountable of answering any questions that a student may have and work iteractively so it's easier to understand. But if the subject is anatomy, a student would be able to learn it no matter the source (in class or online). This type of study is a matter of memorization and comprehension, it just depends on whether the student is willing to put in the work or not. Working in the presence of an educator or working independently at home should rely on what the student is aiming to learn, but the source should be thought through so the learning experience impacts the student in the right way and beneifially.

Attending classes at home can impact a student greatly or horribly, but it depends on who the student is, what they are going through, and what they are trying to learn. Online classes aren't made for everyone, and neither is going to school, but whatever enhances a student's intelect to the highest of their ability, is what is best for them. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
C12807C8F8D5,"In today's world, attending school can be a frustrating, mind-altering, and even distracting experience. There are a variety of factors in schools that can alter a students learning environment and cause them to lose focus. In large environments such as public schools, it is hard to stay on task with distractions at every corner. By making classes available from home, students are able to receive their learning in a non stressful way and get the education they deserve no matter the circumstance.

If students were allowed to attend classes from home, it would be very beneficial. Learning through technology would allow absent students and teachers to keep up with their work and even get ahead for absences in the future. For example, it is likely that most students will have occasional sick days during the school year. More often than not, kids are stuck between going to school feeling miserable, or staying home while missing new curriculum. This puts everyone in a bad position. However, it can be easily prevented by learning through hand held devices and communicating via technology.

In schools, many students can have a difficult time learning in busy environments. On top of that, those with learning disabilities can experience an even harder time, having affects on their grades and progress reports. Having a way to receive a less stressful education just might be the key to solving problems faced by less focused students and those faced with challenges. For instance, if someone is not able to complete their work due to distractions or factors in their environment, they should be able to have the opportunity to finish it outside of school and with the help of a teacher one-on-one through the use of technology.

Although it makes sense that some people might want to lean away from the combination of technology and learning, we are far too advanced not to use it. Advancements in technology would significantly help students who want a more personalized learning experience, and prefer to do their work in a quieter area.

In conclusion, the use of technology and online help would be very beneficial to students and their ability to learn. Factors such as planned and unplanned absences, learning challenges, and even lack of sleep can all contribute to difficulties in school. Being able to attend school from home would be a very good alternative to students struggling in school and allow them more chances to succeed.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5D8E6B28C99F,"Many schools have begun to offer distance learning as a way for students to attend classes from home by using online resources and video conferences. These online classes offer more ways for students to learn, and they are a more accessible option for many parents and students. In this day and age, many students participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports, volunteer work, clubs, etc. with all of these activities going on in an average student's life, they lose time for both homework and their friends. Distance learning programs can help fix this problem by allowing students to learn on their own schedule and not having to travel so much between school and their other activities.

Students would benefit from distance learning, as it would help students manage their time more effectively and leave more time for other activities.

As a student, I participate in a few extracurricular activities, it is practically a necessity to get into a good college these days. I play two different sports and work a job at a local fast food chain, between practice and work, I typically only have a 1-2 hours a day to focus on anything other than school, work, or practice. On days where I have a sports game or an important test to prepare for, those 1-2 hours are non-existent. I am one of many students who experience this problem, and I believe distance learning can help combat this issue. With distance learning, I won't have to waste an hour or two of my day by traveling between school and my other activities. Plus, maintaining a good sleep schedule would be much easier, as more time would be available to sleep, therefore making it easier to learn by not being so tired constantly. Simply put, by offering distance learning, managing time and sleep becomes much easier to do, and with that come the benefits of being more focused when it is time to learn.

Distance learning also allows students to set a manageable schedule of their learning. In the current classroom environment, everyone has to go at the same pace as everyone else. If the subject comes very easy to an individual, than he will quickly find himself bored and tired in that class. On the other hand, if it is a very difficult subject for him, he won't be able to comprehend the important concepts in the same time frame of a student who is good at that subject. With prerecorded lectures and the ability to schedule as many classes as one thinks they need on a subject, students can set their own pace for learning and learn a lot more effectively. It is extremely important that everyone gets an education, but some may need more time or help than others, distance learning is part of the solution to this problem.

Some people may argue that students can not be trusted with the ability to set there own schedule and that many will just stop scheduling classes and learning all together. I disagree, many students hate coming to school, but will still skip classes even knowing the consequences that it will bring in the future. It is because some students dread coming to school so much that distance learning would work for them. With the help of a counselor to help work out an effective plan for learning, kids won't dread school so much, because they can now learn from home in a comfortable environment at their own pace.

That is why distance learning is a great program that should be encouraged throughout school systems. It allows students to manage their time much easier, provides better pacing for learning, and creates a comfortable environment for students. Some may abuse the ability of not having to actually show up at a designated location for class, but students skip class anyways in a regular classroom environment, and distance learning will help reduce that problem if anything. That is why I believe it is a good idea for all schools to start assimilating distance learning, at least to some extent, into their education systems.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6ED2F18504B1,"I think for some kids, learning from home would be a good thing because some kids are always distracted and messing around with there friends.

I think for a lot of kids doing your school online at home instead of being in school would be beneficial. Because lots of kids come to school to hangout with their friends and have no intentions of learning anything.

So for those kinds of kids online school would be a good option for them.

Online school would also be good for the kids dont go to class and just wonder around the halls, or just dont go to class in general. What is the point of them even coming to school? If they arent gonna go to class.

If a kid gets in trouble for skipping school all the time then what is the point to keep getting them in trouble? Just make them do online school at home since they want to come school. No one can force any body to do anything different people have different minds so the think differently.

So online school in my opinion is good for some people, That's the people that always are getting distracted, skipping school, and at school but never in class because he/she are always wondering around the halls.",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students should be able to attend classes form home just to increase their learning skills, take important notes, and to improve their own skills.

Some students attend classes at home to help them increase their learning skills by working on classwork assignments; Classwork assignments on online can help students increase their learning skills. Classwork can help students get smarter and learn what they had struggle with math, science, history, or reading; also, students can take notes at home to collect information from educational videos to increase their learning skills to help them learn faster.

Students can learn themselves by taking important notes to increase their knowledge by watching educational videos; Its a best way to learn by taking notes because it can help them study a lot and learn stuff from what a student have trouble with an assignment.

At home, students work independently to help them by improving their own skills online. Even though some students are learning at home, students can learn by themselves by critical thinking. Critical thinking is a skill that can help students learn their new strategies through out the assignment, which is better for students to improve and learn to get corrert answers.

Students have an option to attend classes at home to learn from classwork assignments to learn what they had struggle with math, science, history, or reading.

5B14E2CB36CB,"Many kids will believe that having to attend classes at home is a good idea because they can work at their own pace and won't have to wake up so early just to get to class on time. But the students need to realize that if schools decided to have video conferencing or online classes, then the schools would need to provide computers to every student in the county, there will be no teachers by their side to make sure they have the reassurance they need, and it will be difficult to stay focus on your school work.

In order for students to be able to do their school work from home, they will need to have access to a computer. Not many students have access to Wifi or any type of technology except when they are at school. The schools will need to get a laptop to every student in the county and that will cost them millions of dollars. Because if the students attended school, the classrooms would be able to share the computers with the kids that are in each class and that way schools would'nt have to provide one for each individual student. Also, giving children under the age of twelve a computer to learn will be a big risk because there will not be someone to look after them and making sure they are doing what needs to be done in order to finish their assignments. And aslo the amount of damages will increase because children are not respondsible with valuable things especially expensive things. This issue is just a part of something bigger that will happen if we were to switch to distant learning.

Another conflict that could happen would be students needing more guidence. When students are in class and need clarification, the teacher will be there answering each and every students questions if they are confused. In distant learning they wont have access to that anymore because there will be no teacher. Since everything is online, students will have to email the teacher and might have to wait an entire day to get a response back. Also, students might need to learn a specific topic a different way and not every teacher is the same. At school the students are able to get help from different teachers and have a different perspective on a subject that they might have never knew about if there were'nt different teachers with different methods at their disposal.

Last issue would be that students will end up getting distracted very easilly. Parents are usually at work most of the day and will not be there to make sure their kids are staying up to date with their assignments because they have a family they need to provide to. Most students have a phone, t. v, or tablet available to them at any time and it will make it dificult for them to stay focus and on track. This will make it harder for students to turn in their assignments on time because it will be hard to resist the temptation of using a device that isnt the computer with their assignment on it. Students need to have a teacher there to help them stay focus on what is nessessary and always have someone to look out for them with their school work.

Students are still children and they need an adult who has been through the struggle to help them get on the right path to success. The students may act like they can be independent but they still need assistance from an adult. Distant learning defeats the whole purpose of being able to interact with one another and having the ablility to have decent communication skills. Children need to get out of their comfort zone and expericence the life outside their own room. There are so many opportunuties that each student could get if they stay in school and put themselves out there and have connections with other people. Therefore, having students attend classes from home would be not be a good decision.                   ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
163AC455E1DF,"In my opinion i think online schooling wont benefit any student because, you dont have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. Youll be able to hear the teacher while shes explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isnt going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being home schooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are home schooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing thats going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then thats fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. Its the law for every student to go to school or to do something thats related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because theyll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you dont understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You dont need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case i think going to school is better then online class and video conferencing. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
FE69FBDD5681,"Is learning online a gift? Students should attend to classes from home because that way the students would have more time to study or do homework, the students would get less distracted, and the students would learn better if they feel more comfortable.

Students would have more time to study, or do homework because they could start school later on the day, or students could start early it depends on how the students feel. Students would feel better if they had a better rest, or knowing they could do school whatever time they feel good.

The students would get less distracted if they learned from home because they are not around their friend or peers, who are usually a distraction. Of course the students will get bored of being alone while doing school but it's better for them to stay focused on what they are doing, and plus they have a better understanding on what they are doing if the students don't get distracted. The students would be more dedicated on the homework's, tests, or projects because they would understand a lot more if they are not distracted by their friends.

The students would learn a lot more if they are comfortable for example people pay more attention when they are in their rooms on their beds or when at their house. Students would rather sit on a comfortable chair rather than a school chair because when your sitting on the same chair everyday your body starts to hurt, or you don't feel comfortable sitting in that position.

Students should have the opportunity to attend school from home because its more beneficial for them, they have a better timing, they are more comfortable when working from home, and they would get less distracted from other students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
37BF4818673C,"Would distance learning benefit students? Distance learning is for a chance for students to be able to attend classes from home. I believe that it would not be a good choice for students to have this opportunity for several reasons. For example, many kids would most likely stop attending school, they would procrastinate, and they would be taking disadvantage.

Distance learning sounds like a good choice for kids whom are home schooled. Students attending school this sounds like a not so good choice. The main reason being that kids would like this better because they would be staying home in bed and comfy clothes all day instead of attending school. When the kids grow up they will have jobs and most of the time they will not be able to have a shot at something like this. We need to show kids how to be responsible and ready to take on a task.

Secondly, I feel like the student would be taking disadvantage of a opportunity other kids might not have. Several kids wish that they could sit in a classroom with other kids and a teacher to ask questions. Not saying that kids over computer wouldnt ask questions but it would be different in way that teachers could not possible physically explain to them. The ability to be able walk into a school and be able to sit down one on one with your teacher is a bonus, something that we should continue to provide for the students.

Lastly, Students would be less involved and would not get opportunities to do hands on projects. Yes, they would be able to ask questions, take tests, or even be involved with the class a little but they would miss out on getting to work with other students and presenting. The students would also have less time to meet new people. This would also be a disadvantage for teachers, if a teacher is in the middle of teaching the class and the student participating in distance learning has a question they will then try and communicate with the teacher and it would just be a huge distraction for the class.

In conclusion, young teenagers everything is online. Us giving this opportunity to students would be us saying its okay to spend all their day on their electronics. This could be would not be affordable to some families who could not afford a computer, camera, and microphone. These are they reasons why I do not stand on the side of distance learning. In my mind I believe that it would not benefit the students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BC27CDCD1A45,"Many schools are integrating online school and even fully switching to it as a means of education. People are against and with this idea and it does have its pros and cons. In my opinion, students would not benefit from doing school at home. A big argument that is at place with this prompt is that many students all learn different. Some people are more hands on and others are more interested learning from textbooks. School being mainly placed at home could also force students to become more independent and that might not be good in some cases.

Schools dont only teach curriculum based classes either, they also have extracurricular classes that might need people to attend in person. Many students like to play sports and even like to participate in band classes. If students are supposed to be learning at home, some would not have the means of transportation to get to the actual school. This could also be challenging for people who may not have their drivers license or even a car. It is not fair for a school to make students learn at home because they might not even have buses that transports kids.

Another big threat that could arise is the possibility that students might not have access to internet. This is probably the biggest setback in the option of online schooling. Some families might not even be able to buy a computer for the student if the school doesnt supply them. Many families are struggling with financial problems and making a student do online schooling is not necessarily fair for everyone.

Technology is also not reliable. Computers malfunction and that is not good if a student is in the middle of a lecture or is taking a test. There is also the possibility that a natural disaster could occur. Depending on the area, many tornadoes or even a hurricane could occur. There is a pandemic spreading around that is called the Corona Virus and it is very deadly if one is to get diagnosed with it. Because of this pandemic, many schools are forced to do online schooling and it is a big struggle for the families that dont have access to the internet.

There is some ways that online schooling could benefit students. Many students get bullied and doing online school at their house could give them a sense that they are safe. This could benefit students because many people who are in high school and any other grade pose a risk of getting bullied if they are not already. Some students also have a condition called agoraphobia which makes them feel anxious and scared in large groups of people and being out in the public. Being able to have access to online school could also be good for students health. Many students are suffering with sleep deprivation and being able to sleep a little later could really make a difference for the student and possibly their grades.

Online schooling could be really beneficial but there are too many setbacks that would make it more inefficient than what school is in its current state of public teaching. People like to be in a setting where they are able to ask questions if needed and get help in an instant. The majority of students benefit from learning in person and that makes a really big difference

In the state that the world is in right now, students are benefiting more from learning in person. Online school is beneficial in certain cases, but it is not as efficient as public school is. Hands on learning is definitely a good factor that schools use and it really does make a big difference. Colleges are looking for students with skills that also pertain to human interaction and public school definitely helps in that aspect. Human interaction is what keeps our society in touch and eliminating that could mean the difference between succeeding and failing.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6204A1726C16,"Schools are known to be one of the struggles that all student go through. Because many students struggle with school, online classes and studying from home became an option. However, attending classes in school is more beneficial than taking classes at home, because students focus more in classes at school than at home, and because school is a place where students meet new people and make friendships.

Although some might argue that schools make students stressed, however, schools provide entertaining trips for students, as mentioned before, schools is a place where students make friendships. A

trip with friends helps to overcome stress. Not to add, schools also offer lots of programs and counseling to help out stressed students to overcome their stress.

Taking classes at school helps students be more focused on the lesson that is being discussed in class. For example, when taking classes at home student will have the freedom to do other things while the lesson is being explained, such as using cell phones or talking to people in the same room. This leads to; students not having the full attention and focus on the lesson. This makes students not fully understanding of the lesson and causing them to get bad grades. Since all the attention will be on the lesson at classes in school, students will be focused and will have better grades. Additionally, taking classes at school also gives students the opportunity to ask questions in case of not understanding something, which online classes don't always provide for students.

School is the place where students make friendships and have fun. For instance, when taking classes at home, students will miss the chance to go school dances and make memories. Also, schools help with meeting new people, learning whats wrong and whats right by going through some trouble. This helps students figure out who they are, and who they want to be. When taking classes at home, it will lower the chance for students to meet new people and to figure out who they want to be. That is why classes at school are more helpful.

As can be seen, taking classes at school is more efficient way, than taking classes at home. Even though schools might be stressful, it helps student be more focus on lessons being explained which leads to better grades. And it also helps students to make friendships, have fun, and have memories. That is why taking classes at school should be more supported.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
5742BBAD7FAA,"Will the introduction of distance learning benefit students or encourage laziness? Some schools are now offering distance learning programs, the ability to attend classes online, as an option for students. Distance learning is a new program that is being introduced to help students attend classes when they are unable to. Some people may say that distance learning encourages laziness by allowing students to stay home where they can get distracted, but in reality it encourages productivity by giving students more flexibility to attend and complete assignments when they are unable to attend school.

The implementation of distance learning programs can prevent students from falling behind in school. There have been many instances of students having to leave the country or state to attend to important family emergencies and as a result fell behind in school. The distance learning program allows students to attend their classes while they are out of state. Since the internet is widely available students will be able to access their lessons and assignments from almost anywhere in the world.

Many people are unable to attend college because they have to work to provide for their family. The flexibility Distance learning provides allows these people to further their education and pursue their dream career while they work. Another example of how distance learning can benefit students is how currently many schools are closed due to fear of the corona virus. Distance learning will allow the students of the affected areas to attend online lectures and complete assignments without going to school.

Lastly, There are some people who believe that online learning will negatively affect students by allowing them to stay home where there are many distractions. While it may be true that students can be more easily distracted at home, Distance learning is meant for students who are serious about their education. The distance learning program provided by some schools were intended to promote productivity out of school in case students are unable to attend.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
D79E9FFDF3AC,"Since the advent of internet technology, society has been trying to take advantage of its features to improve the quality of various aspects of life. In recent years, this has become especially prevalent in education, as the ""flipped classroom"" model continues to gain traction among educators. Amidst all this reform, some see total online learning as the logical next step. However, distance/online learning will never fully replace the physical classroom because with all its convenience also comes a less specialized classroom where it is harder for students to stay focused on their work and receive help when needed.

Distance/online learning is not entirely practical because it does not consider the increased degree of focus that students must have. In a physical classroom setting, there are students who are entirely engaged in the course, but there are also students who frequently allow their minds to wander. In these scenarios, the teacher will chorale those wayward students back into the classroom discussion because they will notice their lack of participation. However, this scenario is much more difficult to envision for a distance/online student. If they lose focus on an assignment, the internet will encourage this mental spacewalk by allowing the student to open other tabs and search for whatever piques their interest. When the student does this, there are little to no repercussions if they are sitting in their bedroom instead of a classroom. While some might argue that the online model teaches students independence and work ethic, many online students will likely never develop either of those skills because they were never truly held accountable for their actions in the firstplace. With all the temptations of the world-wide-web at their fingertips, it is no wonder why students would rather open a new tab and watch

Star Wars than complete their history report. Distance/online students are at a stark disadvantage to their in-person counterparts in both college and the job marketplace because the work ethics built by the in-person students will be much better. Distance/online learning does not take into account the temptations the online learner faces and as such leaves them vulnerable to developing an abysmally poor work ethic that does not translate well into college and the job marketplace.

With all of the resources of the internet, one would think that any distance/online learner would be able to receive whatever type of special help they required. This assumption is flawed. When students have an issue with an assignment in a physical classroom setting, they are only a hand raise away from an answer. Some distance/online learning sites have attempted to make up for this by allowing students to video conference with teachers, but this is only a partial solution. Online teachers often have extremely large class sizes where the ""conferences"" mainly consist of dozens of students watching a teacher lecture; as such, students can find themselves waiting much longer for help than if they were sitting in a physical classroom. When this happens, students would be forced to scour the the internet looking for answers for their specific issue, sorting through tons of content that is incorrect, irrelevant, and unhelpful before possibly finding the answer. Without an educated presence in the room, it is more difficult for students to differentiate between which online sources are completely credible and which are patently false. Distance/online learners are at an educational disadvantage because it takes much longer for them to receive help on coursework issues than their in-person counterparts.

The only conceivable convenience of distance/online learning is the fact that one does not have to leave the home. However, convenience should never given more weight than quality in the area of education. Distance/online learning requires a focus that not every student has; distance education leaves them behind. It becomes harder to receive a quality education when students are not given every resource possible; there is no complete substitute for an in-person conversation with a teacher about one's issues with a given course. By failing to find proper substitutes for the most important aspects of in-person education, distance/online learning hurts the very group it is trying to help.  ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
23972FBA1934,"In some schools students are available to offer distance learning as an option. Do you thing students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I believe that it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home.

Some school have distance learning programs for students to attend classes from home, and that is helpful for students to get an extra time to work on. like in some classes students need to finish their work in limited time and this can make students a little stressful, but in distance learning program students can have enough time to work on.

In this world every person has it`s own dream for the future to be in a perfect way of life. For example some people wants to be a Doctor, Engineer, Athlete, and others want to be Astronaut. However, you have a dream if you are not educated it is so difficult to achieve your dream. In this way if people need to educated to achieve their dream it is impossible to go to school for all person in this world in lots of reasons, like some people live in far from school, do not have enough money to go to school, having apart time job for living, and other reasons can affect their dreams.

On the other hand if students have distance learning program it is not easy to work on assignments and homeworks like students that are able to learn in school, because students that take classes at home do not have teachers and classmates that they can make things more easier to understand by giving examples and more explanations.

In my opinion it has benefit for students to be able attend classes from home, because students can have extra time to work on and if students can not be able to go to school they can attend that class at home. In conclusion having distance learning programs in schools for is most beneficial for students. So schools should have offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, and also students should not give up if they do not have way to go to school or if they are not able to take classes in the school, because they can attend for distance learning program and make their dream achievable, and schools should pay their own role to make achievable students dream.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

9C245C1269BA,"Some many people are voting for students to not attend to school,but instead they should be getting a video conference online from a teacher to their house that way they don't have to attend to school and just stay at home.

This could bring some benefits to students in all the country.

One of the main reason why students have bad grades in school is the distraction. In all my classes there is a group of students that doesn't care about learning in class, they will always be talking loud and distracting everyone in the classroom for example when I'm in my science class I would always be get distracted by a group of students who are talking loud and distracting other people. My teacher would always call the principal and not teach anything,so we don't really learn anything. Because all the time that he waste for those kids we were just listen and watching all that was happening at that time. But if I had a video conference I would not be distracted by nobody and I would not be wasting my time because I would be learning and not bein distracted by other people.

If some students could attend to class by getting a video cofference they would not be warry about the weather conditions. For example my little brother always has to walk to school at 7 am, sometimes when he is on his way to school he can't breath because the temperature are too low, so my mom has to drive him or pay for someone who could leave him at school. So because of that when the temperature are to low he doesn't go to school so when he goes back he has to do all the work that he miss when he wasn't there and all the homework that he miss. But if he could asist to class online he would not be missing any classwork or any homework from school and most important he would not be sick and my mom doesn't has to worry about who can drive him to school.

In my opinion who really doesn't have to attend to school is the students who have any disability. This could be a big benift for those students because I know how hard is to not be available to walk or do something else. In my opinion this could help them so much because they would have to switch from a classroom to another one, and they would not have to travel to those full hallways in school.

Those are some examples why I agree that some students should receive the opportunity to attend to class by a video conference and why the country should accept that not all students can be at school.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1CB3534B82E9,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes online or over video calls.

Even though so students would disagree high school is designed to be the best learning environment for the average student.

Most high school students dread coming to school everyday to lazily sit through class waiting for the final bell to ring, dismissing them back to the freedom of the outside world. Many student feel that high school isnt for them or thats in a waste a time but imagine where youd be without high school. Highschool was created to further basic education and increase to average IQ. It has been improved and renovated over the years to fit the needs of most teens and create a healthy, student centered learning environment. One of high schools best qualities is the option to have individual learning where you are one on one with a trained professional from a wide selection of subjects.

The hardest time in a teenagers life is between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. During this time it's important for teenagers to build a strong social foundation that'll be essential for the rest of their lives. These years are not only the hardest but the most important.

D12739E3912D,"""I aced my chemistry exam,"" said Generic_Name with a well-rested look beaming upon the face. More than one hundred schools around the globe have began to offer long distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from the comfort of their home. Although one may feel students should not hold the opportunity of attending class from home due to the possibility of a student becoming off-task, schools should allow students to attend classes from home because students will hold flexible schedules, hold a well-rested mind, and will be able to focus one oneself instead of social-society.

First of all, schools should allow students to attend classes from home due to allowing students to hold more flexible schedules. When having a flexible schedule, students will be able to manage time wisely and work throughout the day at their own pace. For example, a young woman by the name Generic_Name attends Generic_School. The entirety of the professors allowed the students to attend the classes from home. Hearing this made Generic_Name ecstatic. Now, Generic_Name would not only be able to work at her own pace and still be able to include daily activities she enjoys such as practicing for cross country, or playing the clarinet. Generic_Name now does not need to worry about becoming mentally exhausted as the student can slowly complete the school work, along with taking short-term breaks throughout the day. In summary, schools do not wish for students to become exhausted therefore, students should hold he opportunity of attending classes at home due to having a balanced schedule.

Secondly, schools should allow students the opportunity of attending classes from the comfort of the home due to allowing the students to hold a well-rested mind. Many schools throughout the country start classes promptly at eight in the morning, causing students to have to wake up at the break of dawn. Many students do not get enough sleep, leading to sleep deprivation. When allowing students to attend classes at home, students will be able to hold a well-rested mind in which will allow for better concentration. For example, a junior by the name Generic_Name attends classes from home. The student used to be incredibly unfocused when attending class at Generic_School due to not getting enough sleep yet ever since Generic_Name attended classes from home, the student has been able to concentrate more, therefore becoming successful on every exam. Had Generic_Name not attended class at home and had not fully rested the mind, Generic_Name would continuously decline in his school-work. In summary, students should hold the grand opportunity of attending class from home because it is necessary students hold enough sleep at night in order for success.

Finally, schools should grant students the opportunity to attend classes from home because students will be able to focus on oneself instead of social society. Many students around the face of God's Earth struggle with being bullied as well as worrying about what other people think. If students hold the opportunity of attending class at home, students will only think of one's success. For example, a freshman by the name Generic_Name attends Generic_School. The student has always put up with bullying and strongly dislikes stepping foot in the school each day. Now that Generic_Name is able to attend school at home, the student is as confident as a model on the cover of a magazine. Generic_Name is able to give her full attention to not only herself, yet her school work. The girl does not need to worry about what other people think, nor the latest fashion trends as the student will not need to step foot in the school anymore. To this day, Generic_Name has been the top of her class ever since attending school at home because she she does not worry about what others think anymore. In the end, Generic_Name learned that success is more important than society. In summary, when students do not worry about what others think, success always wins.

All in all, schools should allow students the opportunity of attending classes from home because students will hold flexible schedules, hold a well-rested mind, and focus on oneself instead of social society. If students hold the opportunity of attending classes from home, then students will have a higher chance of success in the future. In order for students to hold the chance of attending class from home, it is a necessity for students to write letters to the school board as well as the school principle.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
1E009323E02F,"Since the development of the internet, online resources have been on the rise. These resources have helped make people's lives easier in many ways, including online schoolwork that is easier to access. Now, schools have been offering programs for students to take classes online or through video conferences and people are wondering whether or not it is beneficial. In many cases, students would benefit by having the option to work at home in case there were special circumstances that required them to be absent from school such as long trips, health issues, or mental health issues.

One way online classes would help students is by allowing them to take longer trips with their family or another community since they wouldn't need to be tethered to one location for learning. Many students travel during the school year for a number of reasons, such as family matters, religion, or even studying abroad. These trips can sometimes be extended over long periods of time. As a result, students tend to miss a lot of classwork from their time away and most students in this situation find it hard to catch back up. Having the ability to take their work with them would keep them from having to catch up and allow them to take as much time away from school as they need. In some cases, this luxury could backfire if students get too distracted by the traveling and their attention on their schoolwork starts to slip. But every student who takes long trips and thinks they would benefit from a program like this should get the opportunity to try it and if it doesn't work out, it can always be taken away.

Another reason online classes would benefit students is that it would provide a safer way for students with physical ailments to learn without posing a danger to themselves or others. Many children suffer from disease or distortment that would compromise the safety of a typical learning environment in a classroom. Because of this, those children typically don't get the opportunity to learn the skills and information that they need to survive in this world, giving the typical student a huge advantage. But with the online resources available, the children with disadvantages would have a much safer way of learning the same information as the rest of their peers without causing complications either by worsening their current physical condition, or by spreading a disease they may have to other students. It may be hard for some students with very serious health problems to take advantage of these opportunities and some might think that there is little point in trying, but the majority of these children want to live a normal life and learning in school is a big part of that. If they are not given that opportunity, they will always be at a disadvantage.

Similarly to students with physical health problems, students with mental health problems can also suffer from being put in a typical classroom setting and would greatly benefit from online resources that allow them to learn in a much safer environment. However, unlike students with physical ailments, students with mental health issues are mostly putting themselves in danger if they attempt learning in school. They might suffer from attention problems that the classroom setting does not help with or they might feel intimidated by other students and not be able to focus on learning but instead become unstable. This is where online classes would help because instead of having to deal with stresses that a classroom can cause, these students could learn in an environment tailored to correcting their disorders or at least not stimulate them. This would be a safer option for all parties involved since mentally unstable children when triggered the wrong way could potentially pose a danger to themselves or the people around them. While there are many students with mental health disorders that are perfectly fine learning attending school, the few who aren't would greatly benefit from online learning programs.

While some students might take too much liberty in pursuing online resources as an alternative to school and would hurt their academic career, the few who need it would benefit greatly from a new way of learning and would use these programs to help their academic career. The majority of school attending students that don't need an alternative would recognize that and stick to the classroom setting. As technology advances, advantages for the disadvantaged are becoming more and more common, and using the resources we create to help those who need help is becoming more and more important.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
47B65C7E16F9,"Online classes can be more convenient for students who may need it or maybe students don't fell as they need to be apart of a public place to learn and to get an education, or they feel as they would do better without being in a class with other students but, schools are offering online classes for students who would benefit from it. Although, some may agree with being able to take online classes but for the student's benefit this is wrong.

First, online classes make it where you become more and more lonely at home with probably the only company of your household family. This makes us lose connections to outside of your house, rather then if you're in a public school while being in a classroom. It can make for being able to connect with others and make friends harder. If you take someone from out of public they will never learn how to interact with others in the real world. We need to be able to socialize with others because thats a majority of what life is; learning to get along with others, how to be respectful to others but, you cant learn these social skills while being stuck inside of your house. It won't benefit students to not learn how to socialize with other as they will need these important skills later on in life.

Secondly, classrooms in school require us to focus more on the subject at hand, online classes which are taken at home give you more ""at home distractions"" with these distractions it makes it harder for you to pay attention, with things such as; Television, Parents telling you to do things, Chores that may take time to do, and things as your own phone which can get in the way of your own learning experience. With these distractions that hinder your education, it makes you less focused at the subject itself, things like your phone getting notifications attract us towards it, while if you're in class you may not be able to use your phone because of certain restrictions but, while your at home you have free range of anything you want to do. Public school have rules so that you can be more focused, which then leads to us being able to graduate, online class makes it where its easier to do whatever we want. Education is important so important that we are required to go by law, and schools have rules which make us more focus on our work for we can then pass on to the real world and become growing adults. Online classes makes us become lazy it gives us the thought of we can whatever and still get an education which will then lead students into not doing their work.

Finally, i think that online classes may not give us a way for direct help from our teachers. When we are in an online class and we can't seem to figure out a certain subject who can we really ask for help, sure you can go on Google but, then that defeats the purpose of school itself because we can just look up the answer without getting a basic understanding, so that wouldn't be helpful to yourself. When a teacher is in front of us teaching us, it gives you a more basic understanding of the subject than just getting answers from Google, you actually get to learn and understand subject. Maybe we could email the teacher but, that doesnt give us an immediate response, we should be able to ask the teacher for help and get help with in a reasonable time.

In conclusion, online classes can be more convenient for students who may need it or maybe students don't fell as they need to be apart of a public place to learn and to get an education, or they feel as they would do better without being in a class with other students but, this is wrong public schools shape us and get us ready for the real world which will help us become growing adults.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Working from home can be helpful to people but can also hurt them. It depends on the key point i'm going to be talking about in this essay.

Students can get distracted to easily. When working fro home there are lots of things that can get you off task. For example family, family can ask you questions or siblings can bother while you try to work. If you play games you might start to procrastinate and blow off your work while you go play video games. You could also end up going to sleep because you nice and cozy in your home.

Some students need totours or face to face help with work. some students need to be able to ask for help when they need it. If students cant ask for help from a teacher in person they they get stuff and give up and try again later or not come back to it at all.

A good thing about doing work from home is students can work at their own paste. Some students dont learn or work as fast as others. If students can work at their own paste then they wont need to rush threw any work and they can do the work more effectively. The more effectively students can do their work the better grades they can get.

In this essay I have talked about the pros and cons of doing work from home. I have talked about why it would benefit students and why it would't . It would be better for students who need more help to stay at school then to work from home so they can get the help they need.      ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
50C08AC99E2D,"School causes anxiety and stress on many students today. Schools that offer distance learning as an option to students are very beneficial because, one on one instruction, better time management and dependency skills, and it makes a comfortable working environment for students.

At times school instruction can be very difficult to understand when you are surrounded by people who are your peers and distract or make you nervous. That leads to students not reaching their full potential in class when they are constantly distracted. There are always times when the teacher is explaining vital information and a student is talking. Distance and online learning offers easy accessible one on one instruction so that students can reach their full potential and not be distracted by other students in the class. When students are being loud and distracting in the classroom it can be hard for students to take in information and have success. Students vary and have different learning styles. Online schooling can help you find an instructor that fits your learning style you will more easily understand the education and knowledge you are receiving.

A lot of students have other activities that keep them occupied sometimes before and after school. School getting in the way of that can have a very negative effect on students by leading them to not be able to focus in school or having to drop that activity. Online schooling and video chatting can help a student improve and obtain great time management skills. Most school days being seven to eight hours long leave students with time after school to either do schoolwork or something like a sport or a hobby. This leads them to go and do their sport or hobby and come to home to pages and pages of schoolwork. Students usually stay up all through the night to complete the work so they will be prepared for their class the next day. Some schools can start as early as 7:30 in the United States so staying up very late and doing work will give students no energy the next day and can have an effect on the quality on a students work. Many students who want to pursue both find that it is very difficult to balance the two and succeed in both. Online schooling allows students to have more time and energy to pursue their interests. Schooling and video conferences online will most likely not take 7 hours; so students can have success in their education and also do what they want to do. This will also teach them dependency skills. Students who take online courses are not in a class room surrounded by peers and other students so they must learn to depend on and motivate their selves to achieve success.

Students in schools are not always comfortable in the classroom. Online schooling provides you with the opportunity to learn and achieve success while being in a comfortable environment. Going to school cause anxiety to a lot of students. Whether it is bullies, schoolwork or even teachers they don't want to see; school itself plays a key role in a students success. Online schooling allowing you to be able to work and learn from where you are comfortable can bring in a lot of success and help students achieve success worry free. Students being stressed out about school and having anxiety could possibly delay the rate they get their work in. Being in a comfortable environment can be a pivotal point in achieving academic success.

Online schooling is very beneficial to today's society whether it is elementary school or grad school. People have different learning styles and fears that keep them from achieving the success they deserve and reaching their full potential. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
18AC57CFB338,"Have you ever woken up in the morning and wished you could just stay in bed? Many students probably experience this on a daily basis. Luckily, with the advent of computers and the internet, you may not need to leave bed to go to school at all. Many schools already use computers to allow students to work on and turn in assignments online. However, some schools now allow their students to attend their classes online as well. The benefits of this option are significant and numerous. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they could attend classes under conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so, learn in a more comfortable environment, and reap the benefits of a more logistically efficient system.

Firstly, the option of online classes would allow students to attend classes despite conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so. For example, during winter, schools across the nation often close because of hazardous weather conditions that make it too dangerous to travel to school. However, with online classes, students could simply be instructed online, avoiding many missed days of valuable learning. This system would also take pressure off of school systems to keep schools open on days with questionably dangerous weather. Without worrying about missing yet another day of classes, schools could make the safe choice and close on more of these days. Additionally, it is common for students to stay home a few days when sick so that they can recover and avoid infecting their classmates. However, it is often the case that despite the risk of infecting classmates, students are still well enough to participate in class, but are unable to do so. With the option of online classes, these students could still participate without risking infection. A present day example of the possible utility of online classes is the Coronavirus outbreak. Many school systems worldwide have already shut down as a result of the virus. With online classes, these school systems could continue to instruct their students while also decreasing the risk of Coronavirus spreading. Overall, there are many situations in which online classes allow instruction to continue when not normally possible through traditional methods.

Another reason that students would benefit from online classes is that home can be a better learning environment than school. In general, home is more comfortable than school for many kids. The ready access to food and a bathroom, as well as an environment that one is familiar with, means that many students would be more relaxed learning from home. With a lower stress level, students would likely be more productive and engaged in their classes. Additionally, some students can get stressed out over the classroom environment. Personally, I know that I have felt anxious in situations when I didn't know the answer to a question I was asked or when I had to read aloud. For me, and for many other students, attending classes from home would help to alleviate some of that stress and anxiety. Some may argue that taking classes from home would reduce students' level of focus. However, students already have to focus at home for homework. By having kids focus on a class at home, it would actually help reinforce their ability to focus and be disciplined in an environment in which they could be easily distracted, which is a useful life skill. Overall, in the more relaxed environment of home, students could be much more productive and successful in their classes than if they attended in person.

One more significant reason for providing the option of online classes is that they are much more logistically efficient than classes taught in person. Firstly, there is no travel time from home to the school. Additionally, transition time in between classes and time for lunch could be saved as well. This saved time could be put to various good uses. Classes could be lengthened, or another class could be added to students' schedules. Students could also get more sleep in the morning; many teenagers are chronically sleep deprived, so this would be a massive benefit. Students could also use the extra time to get a job. One argument against online classes is that they would stop kids from learning to interact in person. However, the time saved through online classes would actually allow students to spend more time out with friends, which would teach them to get along with other people well. Another benefit is that students could attend distant schools that would not be practical to attend in person. Besides the saved travel time, switching to more online classes would eliminate a great deal of paper waste, as many more assignments and materials would probably be online. This would benefit the environment, and it would keep students from having to keep track of both physical and digital assignments and documents. Finally, school systems could save money on a great deal of physical infrastructure, such as school buildings, classroom materials, and buses. The funds saved could be redirected towards giving students computers, paying teachers more, or investing in better learning resources. Overall, the saved time and money from switching to more online classes would significantly benefit students and teachers.

As technology advances, the classroom should advance as well. By embracing the opportunities created by technology, students can learn in ways never before possible and receive a higher quality education. Through more efficient use of time made possible by technology, students can spend more time having fun or earning money while still learning just as much. The online learning environment can make it easier for some students to get engaged in classes. The money saved because of online classes can be reallocated to improving students' education. These great benefits, among many others, demonstrate why online classes should be an option for every student.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
D9266AAB3A51,"Do you worry about being late to or missing class?

Long distance learning has the answer! Students will benefit from using long distance learning by going at their own pace, and staying on top of their work load. Students will also benefit from not having to drive on i95 and other major interstates and unpredictable weather. Students would not have to worry about missing classes or missing work or homework. Even if students are sick they could still catch up on class without much delay. One of the downsides to long distance learning is, if the student is distracted by social media, then there's no one to tell him to focus on his school work. By far the main advantage to long distance learning is being able to stay at your own pace because; if your a slow learner than you would not feel the rush to catch up with the class, or to beat the fastest person in your class. Also staying at your own pace means that you have more time to soak up information rather, than cramming a lot of information into your brain as possible and hope that it sticks. Also if your a fast learner, then you would not have to wait on the slower learners as much in long distance learning as you would in real life.

One other downside to long distance learning is if a student has a question on a problem or a work sheet it may become difficult for a student to contact the teacher. A possible solution to this is a message board between the students and teacher so one or more of the students has a question the students can get the answer they need. The students could also help their classmates through the message board and FaceTime, if one of the students has a question and the teacher can't be contacted.

The main advange to long distance learning is having the student going at thier own pace because everyone is different, everyone learns differently, some are fast learners, while others are slow learners. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
6AEC3D4895A7,"When I think of school I think of a boring room, a teacher talking too fast during a lesson, a desk thats too uncomfortable, and peers i'm too afraid to talk to. It's hard to keep up in class when the teacher talks 100 words per minute. ""I wish I could learn in my room"". Many students constantly face these problems everyday. I do think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

One big point is that students would be able to learn at their own pace. It's highly frustrating when my peers and I can't keep up with the teacher during the lesson. Students wouldn't feel rushed to understand the topic as they can pause the video as many times as they need to. Feeling rushed gives teenagers more stress and anxiety when they don't fully understand information a teacher is saying. It's a proven fact that students are able to learn better when they take their time with learning and understanding the information presented to them.

Second of all is that they are able to learn in the comfort of their own home. Most students get anxiety when they step into the building because of all the constant stares and looks they get. I hate coming to school because the amount of stares I get at seven forty-five n the morning is a lot on my shoulders. Some of my peers don't have proper socialization skills they need for their future. I had severe shyness up until 9th grade because I was always scared of talking to people I did and didn't know. Plus most students learn better by themselves rather than in a classroom. There are a lot more distractions in a classroom than there are at home.

Third of all no one would have absences. Students would be able to take care of appointments and not having to worry about missing class time. When I miss class time it always stresses me out to the max because I have to learn that information all by myself and hope that one of my classmates can explain it properly to me. Student's wouldn't have an excuse to miss any classwork since it would all be online. Teenagers are experts at using technology so they have no excuses what so ever if they miss work.

There are points to make about how students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home. They could still get distracted. Since most teenagers have a phone it would be inevitable for them to not get distracted by it. They could also forget to watch the lesson. I have forgotten to do classwork at times. It will just slip my mind because I stress about so much that i'll just forget about it at times. The cheating could be a lot worse if students could take classes at home. No one would be watching them so they wouldn't get caught in the act.

I do think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Students would be able to learn at their own time witch would be really beneficial to them and the teacher. They would be able to learn in the comfort of their own home which could improve test scores and their attitudes. There would be no absences. It would be physically impossible to miss something since they would be doing distance learning. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F8F47AD6ACBE,"Generic_Name is a freshman in high school who's a very shy person. He stays to himself and doesn't have many friends he tries to fit in but he gets bullied everyday. So this made Generic_Name to stop enjoying school or even stop wanting to do his work. Students would benefit from taking classes at home because it will give them higher self-esteem, it would give them more responsibility, and it will increase their education.

First reason it will give them higher self-esteem kids in school get bullied daily and its makes students not want to learn or make them scared to come to school. All of this would cause depression and make students feel like they are not worth anything. If they could do their classes online at home they would feel safer in the comfort of their own home and get more work done without having the thought of someone bulling them. Some people might come to the conclusion that kids are joking and it's not that serious however, it is because are committing suicide over bullying.

Second reason is it will give students more responsibility this would make sure students get their work in by a certain time without any excuses. Some teachers may let students make up their work but in reality its not benefiting the students who want to go to college because the college professors are not going to be as nice so this would get help them to be prepared. Other people might think that students couldn't handle doing their work on their own time however, they need to realize without giving them a chance they wouldn't know what would be the result.

Lastly, it will increase students education the internet is a big thing in this generation students would be able to learn more things about the different subjects their taking that year. For example history we weren't here when it happen we just know what they tell us the internet could help us learn things the book couldn't. Some people might conclude that students wouldn't use it for educational purposes however, all students aren't like that and shouldn't have to suffer for others behaviors.

In Conclusion, these reasons all benefits the students future and well-being it will help them get a better understanding in life and what the future holds for them.     ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
3F8CFCF8DF07,"Can a students' education go beyond the institution at which it's at? There are many debates, conflicting arguments, and controversies over distance learning as a beneficial option for learning students. Some will argue, that it allows students easy access towards their class and it betters their time-management skills. Though others debate that the students learn better in a face-to-face environment with traditional learning techniques. While each of those arguments are compelling, the debaters of said arguments, are not a student themselves, and have probably not taken an online or virtual class. As a student who has taken an online class, I know that it may be very difficult and challenging, but it's very beneficial for the student. Distance learning is extremely beneficial for students who are in need of more credits and a better grade point average.

One of the many arguments against distance learning, is that the traditional teaching method, face-to-face learning, is the best way for a student to learn. This debate is old, weak, and repetitive; the subject of traditional learning has been brought up in many similar arguments, but always ends up silenced by new and improved ways of teaching. One of those improved ways of teaching is distance learning; this form of education is shown to help students with their time management skills and learning capacity, while as traditional learning hasn't improved since it's been implemented. Traditional learning may be the norm, but it isn't what's always best for students; every student has different needs and a different learning style. With the option of distance learning there can be a variety of traditional and distance learning for students to pick and choose from, so that they have every chance to succeed.

One of the major benefits of distance education is the chance to earn more credits throughout the year. Many students at the end of their junior year, scramble to collect enough credits to graduate; with only a limited amount of classes they can take per year, the option to add a needed credit might be lost. This is quickly counteracted by the existence of online classes; distance learning allows for students to take several courses without the ""class time"" being enforced, unlike taking a traditional class in a school environment. Meaning, that a students classes during the day can be booked while at school, but they can still take a virtual class while outside of school and earn their credits. This is extremely beneficial for the students that need more credits to graduate and don't have the space in their schedule to fit it in, as well as the students planning on graduating early or planning on becoming valedictorian.

There are several benefits of allowing the option for virtual classes, one being that a student may be in need for a higher grade point average. Almost all students have had their GPA drop in their freshman year due to their lack of preparedness, with distance learning there are many ways for a students' grade point average to go up. Though a students' GPA might not go up a full number, there is a chance for their GPA to rise up significantly. With the chance to take more classes than what fit into a students' school schedule, the amount of credits you can have rises and along with it, the grade point average. This gives students the chance to fix their mistakes made in freshman year and get back on track, along with the possibility of more options for their future.

Distance learning is extremely beneficial for students who are in need of more credits and a better grade point average, in which the student is able to use their time wisely, correct past mistakes and look ahead towards the future. This new, innovative way of teaching and learning can be helpful to all students if allowed, for it is beneficial in every possible way.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
829A1FD8A7EF,"Is it a good idea for schools to use online learning for students that can't make it to class? for many reasons their are many students that can't make it to class,like if a student gets sick or has a loss in the famliy. There should be a way for the student not to fall behind, and there is online schooling. online schooling and video conferencing are great thing for the students and the school.

One of my friends Generic_Name recently had an injury while play lacrosse. Generic_Name is now not allowed to leave his bedroom beacuse of the injury was very serious. But beacuse of online schooling Generic_Name is not going to be behind on school he will just complete the work at his home with no stress. Generic_Name can rest assured once he can get back at it he will be right there with the rest of the students. Thats only part of the help online schooling does to help students learn

The other thing it online school isnt just for students teachers get sick too. My algebra teacher Generic_Name was sick with the flu and was not able to make it to school. So Generic_Name loged on to her computer and sent out all of the task they were gonna do that day. Now not only is that class still caught up with all the other classes Generic_Name was able to take a break and relax at home while not haveing her students fall behind.

Some people might say online school and video conferencing is just a waste of money its not the schools fault. But any amount of money isnt a waste if its for the wellbeing of our students and staff. if a student can make it to school good on them but lets not punish the kids that can't.

75727BE9749A,"Allowing student's to take classes from home should be a crime! Students would fail to complete assignments on a greater scale than at school. There is a greater variety of things that can occur when a student is at home rather than at school. It just calls for more opportunities the student has to avoid doing school work. students would not benefit from the opportunity to attend classes from home as it would make students more likely to procrastinate, get distracted, and skip valuable classes.

As a student myself, it has been an uphill battle against procrastination. It's an ongoing problem that hasn't gotten any easier as the years go by. Considering the workload that is given throughout the later years of high school, it definitely makes it a lot more challenging to manage. This is an issue that not only affects myself, but also many other fellow students, which can make the problem a lot more severe. Most students have parents who work during the day which means there's no adult monitoring them while they're ""taking their classes."" This enables the student to engage in other activities rather than attending their classes.

There are countless distractions a student is exposed to while in the comfort of his or her own home. The cellphone is one of the most distracting of them all. It is a gateway to a variety of social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, and many more. Video game consoles such as Xbox Ones, PlayStations, and personal computers are also an enormous temptation in this day and age. Thus,making it incredibly difficult to focus on what needs to get done especially if there aren't any adults in the household.

Skipping classes has become a normality nowadays, making it one of the major flaws in the school system. This is a problem that needs to be resolved because it's only getting worse with the newer generations. Many Students are using transportation apps such as Uber and Lift to get them from school to their desired destinations. Students would be more prone to this sort of behavior at home for the simple fact that they're allowed more freedom and have greater access to these particular apps. If they don't care enough about their classes whilst there at school they definitely won't care whilst they're at home.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from the opportunity to attend classes from home because it would make it easier to abuse the school provided system in three major ways. It would make it a whole lot easier for students to put off assignments to later dates. It would for sure make it easier for students to get distracted with many things in their households. And it would also make it a lot more easier for students to avoid taking their classes while under little to no adult supervision. While it's clear that there are students who do everything to make their education worthwhile, there are many students who choose to abuse the school system and it's only getting worse.                                 ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B5FF33681C22,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending a school can get you ready in the real world then just attending classes from home.

Those who say attending classes from home say that because teacher cant teach the way they want. They have to follow the way the schools wants you to learn. For example, the teacher does not want to teach some of the stuff hes given but he has to because at the end of the day this is his job and he does not want to lose his job. When your attending classes from home you have more sleep and you wont be tired because it will be at your own time. And also you dont have to be in a class that the teacher dont really like to teach because over time some teachers lose that feeling that they loved.

However, people believe that attending schools is way better then just staying home. Some reasons you should attend school then stay home is that you will have more fun in a class room then just home all the time. For example, you will make friends and do stuff together the will make your time more joy able then just at home. you wake up and go to school you see your friends and you make jokes and help each other and it is limitless.

Another reason you should attend school then classes at home. Schools have field trips,sports,after school activities that you will probably love to do. Because you have the chance to try all of them at school. For example, there are filed trips to the art museum that have great at works like the monalisa. And filed trips to New York and other places that you will love to see. Sport teams are like family, you watch each others back and help improve you game together and thats something you cant get from home or video conferencing. Other reason why you should attend school with others is that someday you will find a bond with someone or a group that will last and you will be grateful for. For example, There were couples in high school that later on got married and there were these groups that became friends actually the became family.

In conclusion, Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending school is better for your kids in the long run. You can learn more in school then you could ever at home and you will make friend and maybe family.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
65D771A9D1FD,"School is a requirement for all children and young adults in the country, so distance learning would be beneficial to any students who are unable to attend. Reasons for this include mental and physical disabilities that may inhibit a child from experiencing a normal and comforting education, allows those who are sick or unable to attend certain days the opportunity to not fall behind, and would make attending class easier by not requiring students to wake up as early as they do and prepare for school.

As all humans and creatures on earth do, people will inevitably get sick. Because of this, students could miss crucial education and fall behind, creating a lull in their schedule as well as lowering their grades. By creating a system where students are able to work from home, unforeseen events such as an illness or injury will not be as great of a setback as before. From personal experience, only missing two days made a scenario where I had missed multiple tests, a plethora of notes and information, and in class assignments that I would end up turning in late, all while trying to complete the current work as well. While it does seem like a benefit to just skip the day to get better, walking to a computer and working from home does not require much work at all and would serve to be much more beneficial than missing a day of school.

Online learning can be either part time or full time, and thus if a full time online attendance is set in place, it would make attending class that much easier. By attending class online, students do not have to deal with the daily chores of waking up early, preparing for school, and in many cases rushing to leave in order to not be late. Being tardy for a class can be severely punished even if it was not directly the students fault, which could lower productivity and motivation. It is widely known that students complain about this dilemma already, and with online learning, it can be solved in a simple and cost effective way. Opposition to this idea might say that the social aspect of school is as important as education itself, yet this is not the reason for attending school, for it is to learn and prepare for college, adult life, and work.

Mental and physical disabilities are far spread greatly varied, and create situations where it is harder to preform physical tasks, learn, or even communicate with others in society. This causes a problem where it becomes difficult to attend school effectively, either due to the stress or confusion created by other students, or the literal inability to preform satisfactory and participate in certain activities. Certain students with autism, asbergers syndrome, etc, may find it extremely stressful to forcefully attend an environment where they are exposed to peer pressure, bullying, and sometimes harassment. Individuals with certain physical limitations such as being crippled or wheelchair bound may find it hard if not impossible to engage in activities such as sports, or even any activity that requires a major amount of movement. As somebody who has a family member with autism, I see the effects of going through this environment, and hear the many complaints and ways it upsets him every day. While it might be possible for physically handicapped people to find a way to work around their problem, people with mental disabilities will almost always attend some kind of specialized learning in school, which even then has flaws from being in school. Through online learning, these students can be given the opportunity to flourish in society through a comfortable environment.

The previously stated reasons reflect upon the need for online and distance learning to be more widely spread in this country. In doing so, many new opportunities will be created while making solutions to many challenges in every day life. All aspects and corners of life will be able to cope with school and their own education plans to make a future that benefits them and the rest of the world. Stress would most likely be lower than its current average in the student age group, and national grade averages would see a rise. This change could make the United States a more economically successful country due to higher education rates and success in schools, and make it look better as a whole.    ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.

Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school can't be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. For example in today's society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.

Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
985FC4A0FAE2,"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school that's a lot of benefit for people that don't work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school.

Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason.

Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you that's helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home.

Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they don't have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the don't have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they don't have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online that's going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
2E5A5418F173,"Easy,convent,and relaxing. These three words describe the benefits of students attending classes from home. Although some students would say they would benefit from attending classes from home, nevertheless, other students would disagree because not every student would benefit attending classes online. It would mean no teacher assistance and it would increase the chances of students cheating on their assignments.

To begin, students attending online courses would have no assistance with their assignments and if they have any questions they would have to rely on themselves or the information that has been given to them. For example, if a student has to take a test online and doesn't understand the question usually they can ask the teacher for help,but in this situation they can't because the computer is the teacher. The student would have to use the information that is given to them as their resources and they would have to use their knowledge of what they have learned without the help of the teacher. This shows, that by the student attending classes online they are more likely to struggle which would likely lead to the student to picking the incorrect answer during the test because if they have a question their is no teacher their to assist them. clearly, students attending class online will struggle with tests or assignments because their is no teachers their to answer their questions.

Furthermore, students attending classes online are more likely to cheat on exams because they are home alone and their is no adult supervision. For instance, if a student were not to understand a question on a exam for one of their online classes they will most likely look it up on the internet for the answer and when they find the answer it. It will later become very easy for them to cheat on their exams or assignments because their is no adult supervision to make sure they are not cheating. This shows, that students are more likely to cheat on exams or assignments with no adult supervision. Obviously, Students who are attending classes online will more likely cheat in their courses because their is no adult supervision and they can always access another device other than their computers.

Some students say they would benefit from online courses and being able to be home while attending school from online, but others students would disagree and say they would not benefit from attending online school. Students say if they are to do online classes they would have no teacher assistance and some students would likely cheat on their assignments just to pass the course. In conclusion, schools that offer online school for students will not benefit them in any way like a classroom environment would if they were.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Also Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way online or video conferencing. I think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home.

Some students take class in home because they do not have time to go to the school. For example, this e students need to take class from online because they work at night or at day . Clearly, they do not have time to go the school because they time is short and they need to organize their day for take a class so, some students take a class from online because their have many reason . In summary, some students need time for study , and they need this position from online for study and they can finish their class.

To day in the world exist many disease, and we need to get precautions with this dangerous disease. So for this problem some students can't go to the school for this big problem. Relating, this problem with school because the students health is so important. For example, the corona virus is so dangerous, students need a protection, because this illness inflict many death. Is so easy to get sick. For this reason, is important to students to get class from online or video conferencing, is better study at home and also a good place, is the best way for students not get sick from this dangerous disease. However, this disease not have medication, but students we cant to prevent get to sick also, studying at home. In summary, is important to caring students they are the future for the world. For this reason some school need to get dis option, learning from online or video conferencing.

In another hand , i think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home, and other people belief, this not a good idea , students would benefits from being able to attend class from home for this issue, students not leaning in one video conference but, some students don't want to go to the school because they have more than 17 years old or they can't enter to school for their age. Because, for you can enter to school minimal you need to have 15 to 17. Also, you have 18 you can't not to enter at school and is a problem because you can't find a good work if you dont have a graduation certificate from school. For example, some students want to study , but they can't because they can't enter to school for their age, I think is so important to exist a program when the people older the age can study line or video conferencing. However, many people need to get a certification but they can't for this problem, also the best solution is studying online is more accessible for them. They can have more opportunities in their life , they can get a better job. For instance students can learning online , is a big benefit for this students was can't enter at school. In definition everybody need a opportunity for study, for get a certificate from school. obviously the students are responsible with their class at home.

The benefit was school online or video conference represent is the student get more concentration at home , they do not have distraction for any other students, they do not suffer by bulling and they can get a good grade studying a lone in home. For example, sometime students get bad grade for this reason , distraction , they can't sleep at night also, they need to wake up to early for this reason they sleep in class,and they not put attention because they are tired. Also, the students have the opportunity to studying online they can organize their time and pass their class easy because they are focus with their class online also they not have distraction and its for that reason they get a good grades, students need class online or video conferencing , this program help many studying or many young girl are pregnant. Some young girl want to finish her high school but she can't because her are pregnant. However, some school get a program studying online is to much better for this students are pregnant is more easy, to studying at home because she can eating when she hungry and carrying her health for her baby. The program studying online is important to exist help to many students with different problems situations or health problems. In summary learning as action for students who wants to study online or video conferencing. I think is a good program for many students who want to study. Clearly, everybody has the opportunity to study obviously the students who get study online has a responsible to attend every day their class and get their certification high school.

In conclusion, class online or video conferencing have many option to study, just is question of time for the students , they need to organize time for study online and can graduate , this program no have many different then the school just, the student need to stay alone and the benefit of that is you can concentrate better alone by your self. Also is better studying at home for this many disease dangerous is more comfortable state at home. However students no need age for study, what they need is inspiration and intelligent for study not need age.

4413099767EB,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This could be beneficial to some students depending on the situation. This opportunity could allow for the learner to flourish rater than drown by being overwhelmed. This could also be beneficial for those who struggle with being still for eight hours at school to be able to take a break every so often. It would be a good opportunity to those who are: being bullied, having trouble with mental health, and struggling with a unsuitable learning environment.

Students often say that school is enjoyable because their friends are there. However, there are some students who struggle to find those friends, which could lead to the development of bullying. These bullies could be completely ruining a student's life and more often than not the teachers never do anything about it. This type of situation could be toxic and decrease in the development of the student. These students often begin to slowly distance themselves further from school progressively, which could lead to a down spiral in grades. Allowing for these struggling learners to work from home would allow them to be in a familiar environment with no one there to influence them as a person.

1 out of 10 students struggle with some sort of mental health issue whether it be anxiety or depression; everyone has something going on in their head. These students with this issue could have severe social anxiety. For example, if a student struggling with anxiety is in a school with 1,000 other kids it might cause the student to have an anxiety attack. This could cause them to slowly dislike the setting and they will begin to take days off from school because they want to avoid the chance of the attack entirely. The grades will plummet due to the absences, which is in the end not fair to these students struggling with the issue. The opportunity for these students to work in a peaceful environment will allow for them to flourish as a learner.

Students all have their own ways to retain information, some prefer visual, and others could prefer audible. This meaning that, everyone has some setting that works best for them. Some individuals could thrive in the school environment, while others could not. Given the opportunity, some students would take the chance to take the courses they regularly take at home. It could allow for these struggling students to take a break when needed and retain information better. This opportunity would be beneficial to the educational development of the student.

However, some students could abuse this opportunity as a way for them to stay home and do nothing. This could become unsuitable for those who need the extra push to do their work. These students could end up having too much free time on their hands and it could lead to the development of an unhealthy situation. This being said it understandable why the opportunity would not be given. But, the students who genuinely need this opportunity will not take advantage of it, they will use it to their benefit.

This opportunity that these struggling students would be offered would be extremely beneficial to their future. This option would be more beneficial than not as long as those who are given the option are monitored. This chance could allow them to reach their goals and accomplish achievements they never thought they could. The setting and the people in the school could be holding these learners back from achieving greatness. Not all people are in the same situation, not all struggle with the same things, people are victim to bullying, go though anxiety, and could not flourish in the environment their in. This chance would allow for the growth and development of the student mentally, physically, and emotionally.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
807EB6CA95EB,"Students will benefit from attending classes at home via online and/or video conferencing because of the level of flexibility for students, the betterment of their mental health, and its availability.

For students who play sports and are constantly going away for competitions, games, etc, the flexibility of online school and video conferencing is extremely beneficial. Having the ability to use this tool is a great and convenient way of learning for those students. Not only is it convenient but as a result of attending classes online students will not have to miss any important assignments, which if missed, could result in a student getting behind on school work and may even cause lower grades for them in the long term.

Taking classes online can aid students on sport teams as well as those that have jobs. Many high school students have jobs and work whether to help out at home, have some disposable funds, or for many other reasons across the board and for those when they can work being physically present in schools can be very limiting on the hours they work. Depending on when their school dismisses them. With some schools letting out at as late as 4:30 P.M., students are left to working hours after 5:00pm which for some can result in them working until as late as 8 or 9 P.M. on school nights. This leaves the student little to no time to socialize, complete homework, and most importantly get the proper amount of sleep needed for the students ever growing brains. For students who work, online schooling is very helpful because it allows for them to have more options in terms of working hours.

Although attending classes from home by the use of online or video conferencing may seem as though it would negatively affect the student because of a lower level of interaction with others, it can do quite the opposite. For many students bullying in school is a harsh reality that they have to deal with everyday when in attendance, which can affect their health and school work very poorly. But in the cases of those who have had bullying be a constant occurrence for them while being in a school environment, this lower level of interaction with others through the use of online schooling can be very helpful and can have a positive impact not only their grades but their well being.

Lastly taking classes online is benefital because of the availability. Often times for students who may not fully know and comprehend the material being taught to them because of many reasons such as the distraction from others in the classroom, or poor teaching style for example can make it almost impossible to work on and finish assignments that are given in school. Once the bell rings at the end of the day students are left to their own efforts to figure the unit because many teachers do not provide practice before or after school and stduents can not always go to outside online sources as a result of the lack of reliability, etc.

Whereas in they were take classes online through the school from the very beginning the student would always have access to learning targets, and with less distraction from others there is no one to take their focus from their work which can cause students to finish quicker, and turn in better quality assignments. Now with that all being said there are many benefital reasons for students to take online classes.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
45775C79FA64,"Over the years, the use of technology in schools has become more and more normalized, Sites, such as Blackboard and Google Classroom are used throughout the school year by teachers, students, as well as parents. There are many people that are skeptical about these changes, but especially the idea of schooling through online programs. Some feel as through it isn't in the best interest of students, and shouldn't replace a traditional education. Although some disagree, students would benefit from attending classes at home because it'll improve mental health and allow more flexibility.

Students would benefit from enrolling in courses at home because it'll simply be easier for some. Mental illness can be very debilitating and can significantly affect a student's performance in school. A lot of the time, this is overlooked, or simply ignored, as it is often stigmatized. Conditions such as anxiety and depression are common examples, and stress will simply exacerbate one's symptoms. Such things would make attending school extremely difficult for some students. Being able to do coursework at home would likely alleviate the problems they were having before, allow for improvement, and later success. Other things that people don't always think about, or may even look down upon, is treatment and recovery. Relapse, tragedy, etc would be common examples as well. Being able to do courses online might be the best option for someone that wants to take time off to get better, and return to school once they're ready. In conclusion, people face situations that others might not even think about, and so they shouldn't be stripped of an option that would ultimately be best for them.

Students would benefit from enrolling in courses at home because it allows for more options. Some may do better by planning out their day based on what works for them. For example, school is typically an 8 hour day, from 9am-3pm, 5 days a week. This is probably fine for most, but others simply can't operate like that. For example, some people might feel more attentive in the evening, and therefore can be more productive then. Some might have a hard time focusing for long amounts of time, and do better with breaks throughout the day. The list goes on. Traditional education is usually very restrictive and doesn't accommodate for people that don't do well with said issues. Another reason this would be a better option for students, is so that one would be able to plan out their day and fulfill responsibilities. This might be work, taking care of siblings, or parents, and so on. But, it might also include other activities, like sports, music, travel, etc. Online schooling would be convenient for those with different lifestyles. In conclusion, all of these things would be made possible while allowing a student to receive adequate education.

Many people make the argument that doing courses from home isn't an appropriate way of learning, and should be done in the classroom. Reasons will include things like, ""it's an excuse for students to continue bad habits and remain irresponsible"", ""it was good enough for us back then"", or ""they should be able to do it like everyone else"", etc. Some may hold such opinions because it's simply an unconventional way of learning, or allows students the freedom to do things their own way. But it stems from the belief that a student's reasoning behind it are unacceptable. There's also an assumption that homeschooling is a new concept, when it's not. The only thing that's changed is one's ability to access resources from home, through their computer. Adults essentially do the exact same thing when they do their own work from home. This is known as teleworking . For example, my mom, an economist, gets to do this several times a week because it gives her a flexible schedule. Certain occupations, such as computer asssistance allow for this too. If reasons that include mental health, or individual preferences applies to both adults and students, why should there be a double standard?

In conclusion, the most important thing is that all of us have an opportunity for success, and whether one gets there online or on-site shouldn't matter. Everyone's situations aren't the same, and so each individual one should always be considered, not compared to others. Advancement of technology has helped many people all over the world, regarding education. The ability to receive an adequate one is essential for one's success and benefits the many people who don't have access to it. This not only includes K-12, but post-secondary education as well, as online degrees and certifcations are continously being introduced.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
149E8C278863,"Going to school and learning can benefit students in a lot of ways. You get to see your friends and be with them while you learn. It's a lot better than being at home and learning from there. Being present in a school is one of many reasons why learning at school is better than learning online or via webcam. A big part of education is being face to face with your teacher and taking in all the knowledge their providing you. Learning online can be a struggle for some students. Having a teacher present and helping you learn in person is something many students benefit from. For example, math is a subject that involves a lot of problem solving and can be very challenging to one learning. You have to workout problems and write things down in order to solve the problem. Some students aren't skilled enough to hear how to solve and then do it themselves. Less skilled students need the teacher in person showing them how to complete the problem rather than telling them how to solve it. That's how it is with all subjects, not just math. Students can benefit way more from a teacher showing them how to do something instead of telling them how to do something.

A conference over the phone or a webcam and online education can be very tricky. Phones and computers don't always work. At times they can stop working and shut down. If that happens then you won't be able to learn at all. On the other hand, going to an actual school and learning is way easier than that. All it requires is a chalkboard or a white board and a marker and your good to go. Teachers don't have to rely on a computer or phone when their teaching in a classroom. In some cases teachers will you use a computer to show a video or a program for students to learn from. but that doesn't mean they have to stop teaching at that point. Meanwhile, if a student is at home learning or on a conference with a teacher and your phone and computer stops working then you have no other choice then to stop working. It could happen once and have a student miss out on a lot of education. Online education or a video conference isn't a reliable way of learning. However, a student can always rely on going to school and having a teacher ready and prepared to teach.

There's visual learners and there's learners who can succeed by hearing. A visual learner wouldn't be able to learn if they did online education. They would be setup for failure because the school didn't organize the education around the student. Making an option for a student to learn from a video conference or online is a risk schools would have to take. Some students could choose that option but end up failing because they didn't know how well they learn online or from a video conference. Another risk with that option is some students might take advantage of it and choose it so they can stay home and not participate. Some students may choose the option of learning online but instead of doing that they could do other things. However, if they go to school then they have no other choice but to learn. They also wouldn't be allowed to do anything but learn because their is a teacher present and can monitor everything they do. Offering those ways of learning as an option is a huge risk. Students could take advantage of it and fail the whole purpose of allowing those options. Schools could get a lot of hate for it if the students use them and don't follow the rules. No school should ever want that happening to them. That's why there are many risks in allowing students to learn through an online or a video conference.

Going to school and learning is a much safer option than learning online or through a conference. There's a lot more benefits and many great things that come with it. Students are setup for success by attending school rather than learning online. They also have a higher chance of succeeding. Some students may do better learning online than others but it's still better going to school and learning. It's also a much safer option. I know I would do better going to school and learning. I would get distracted by my phone or video games or tv and then I wouldn't get any work done. If I'm at school I know I would get way more work done than I would if I was at home. Teachers are able to help me with my work and also keep off my phone. I often procrastinate while I'm working at home and it's hard to focus in that type of work enviroment. Meanwhile, if I'm at school teachers are there to keep me on track and help me on my path to finishing all of my work. I think I can speak for most students when I say that. We all love doing other things rather working on our work and if we can find any opportunities to get out of doing work then we will. Online education and a video conference are very easy to get out of if your not at school with a teacher watching.

Some might say that if your learning online from home your parents can watch you or supervise. Yes that's true but some students may go to their room and work or say their working when they're really not. For example, one may be doing their work one moment and the next moment their doing something completely different. Once again that's another reason why going to school is a much safer option than learning online. Even though some students can succeed learning online others can't. Teachers shouldn't have to waste their time only teaching a couple students in class when others are at home learning. Having to go to school and being face to face with a teacher learning from them can benefit students way more than learning online or through a video conference can.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
3A9561759383,"Benefits of Online Conferences in Schools

Let's make a change that all schools in the United States have to follow. All schools should allow students the option for video conferences. Some schools offer distance learning such as video conferences as a way for students to attend class at their home. Having the option to attend class at home is very beneficial. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they will get more sleep, have more comfort and will be safer.

Firstly, students will be able to sleep longer by being able to attend classes by video conferences. Many students take the bus and have to wake up early for school because they have to shower, eat breakfast, and get dressed for school. By giving the option for video conferences students wouldn't be stressed to complete their morning routine in time. Also, studies have shown that students who are well rested, with the recommended eight hours of sleep tend to receive higher grades. As one can see, students will be less stressed and will receive higher grades just be receiving more sleep.

Secondly, students are more comfortable in their own home than at school. With having video conferences as an option students will be able focus more and have less distractions. At school there is plenty of distractions such as fellow students and many background noises. These distractions can lead to lower grades since students can't concentrate and do their best work. When a student is at home they can go to the bathroom, get food, and get drinks whenever necessary which is more efficient than having to wait for lunch and follow different classroom rules.

Also, studies have proven that students tend to learn more when they are in a place where they are comfortable and can relax. By the reasons stated above people can see that being comfortable can be more beneficial.

Thirdly, being able to have video conference classes at home, students will be safer. Many students drive to and from school everyday. By having classes at home students wouldn't have to drive as much causing the vehicular accident rate to decline. Also students wouldn't have as many bad influences surrounding them. For example, if Generic_Name was at school for class he would be surrounded by other students that do alcohol and drugs. By not being around them Generic_Name can prevent being per pressured to use those illegal substances. By the evidenced stated above students will be safer by having the option for video conference classes.

In conclusion, having video conference classes is very beneficial. Many people argue that not everyone has technology at their homes but schools don't require students to use the online conferences, they can still come to school for their education. By being able to get more sleep, have more comfort, and be safer students are more benefited by having the option for video conferences. If schools didn't offer online conferences their would be more accidents and less educated people. If that were to happen the US economy would decline and the US would slowly crumble. Do you want that to happen? Hopefully not. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
961BFAA21188,"In today's society, advancements in technology are changing the world everyday. Applying these advancements of technology in learning could be the next major advancement. Some schools are already starting to take advantage of these new technologies by applying them to learning and in the classrooms. Some schools now offer distance learning by way of online or video conferencing from home. This could be very beneficial for students because distance learining from home could provide less distractions, teach responsibility, and learning from home is far more convient.

To begin with, limiting distractions from learning could make a large difference in how effecient students are in their learning; that is why distance learning is so beneficial to students. With students being in the comfort of their own home they can just simply focus on their education, they dont have to worry about distractions like other students conversing with them. There are so many distractions in the classroom that students could avoid if they were learning from home such as: social status or being popular, bullying, disciplinary action, and trying to fit in. All of these distractions could effortlessly be avoided through distance learning.

Another reason why distance learning could be beneficial to students is because of how convient distance learning is for students. The convience of distance learning can save students a lot of time and help them focus more on learning so that that they can completely grasp and master all of the concepts being taught to them. The convience of distance learning can allow students to learn from the comfort of students own home, in effect allowing them to focus more. The convience of distance learning from home gives students the freedom to pause a video to get a better understanding or take notes, or maybe even take a short break if needed. In contrast to student's who learn at school in this situation they dont have the freedom to pause a video they would just miss key information or fall asleep. With the convience of distance learning student's also dont have to worry or stress about a teacher teaching to fast. Distance learning is so convient that students dont even have to worry about a bus getting them to school late, causing them to miss importat information. The convience of distance learning could be extremely beneficial to helping students learn more effeciently.

The final reason why distance learning could be more beneficial to students is because it teaches students a sense of responsibility. Distance learning could teach students responsibility because it makes them stay on top of their own assignments and be responsible for their own assignments. While in contrast to school teachers are always forcing students to do their assignments, that is why distance learning could make students more reponsible. The only benefit students get at learning at school is real life interaction with real people. Although since students who are learning at home dont have a teacher giving them assignments and a bell to tell them when to leave and go to class, students learning at home have to teach them themselves a liitle bit of time management to help them stay ahead of all thier assignments. Time management is a very effecient way to complete any task given in an orederly fashioned; allowing students to work more effeciently. Time management is also a skill that you will need in life so puts you at an advantage to learn it early. Distance leaning gives students a lot of benefits and teaches a lot skills such as time management and reponsiblity, but these of are just a few of them many skills that you can learn from distance learning.

In conclusion distance learning from home is a far better way to learn, rather than learning in school. Learning at home puts you at a lot of advantages on other students, which will bring significant benefits once completed. Distance learning teaches you skills you wont learn at home and limits distraction. Distance learning also enables students to learn more effeciently. With all of these reasons why distance learing is so much more efficent than learning at school, more students should definetly consider swittching to distance learning from home. Just to wrap this up more students should try distance learning and take advantage of the opportunity while it is at hand.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Although some may believe home-schooling is a superior alternative, the motivation and socialization that would be present in a classroom would be nonexistent at home.

Motivation is a trait that many young adults need more of, whether it is waking up on time for class, or not procrastinating on a school project. Waking up early is something nearly everyone will have to do in their lifetime, so it is better to get used to it while you're still young. If a student has been home-schooled their whole adolescent life, waking up early will be something that they struggle with as an adult. Procrastination is something that many students have a hard time avoiding during the school year. The root of procrastination is a lack of motivation. Part of a teacher's job is to keep the students on task and make sure that they are completing everything in a timely manner. Home-schooled students do not have the availability of a teacher to motivate them and make sure that they are doing their work. It is all up to them if they want to stay on task or fall behind. If no one is there telling the students what to do, they will struggle to find the motivation within themselves. As well as teachers, peers also help to encourage their fellow classmates to stay focused. This leads into the next topic of socialization.

High school is a period in one's life where they should enjoy their youthfulness while still working hard in school. It is important to balance the two out as they are equally as important. A school is the central point of socialization, whether it is working together to complete an assignment, or just conversing during your lunch break. Many long lasting relationships are established within a school environment. Home-schooled students cannot relate to in-school students in this sense. Not only is it important to form friendships, but it is also important to get comfortable around large crowds of people. Talking to people is an inevitable fate in everyone's life, this might be giving a presentation at work or publicly speaking in college. While it is a burden to most, starting earlier in life will provide more confidence for when you need it later in life.

There are many valid reasons that support the practice of home-schooling. For example, students with social anxiety will be better off in the comforts of home. Students might get anxious around a large crowd for many reasons. For one, self conscious people might get anxious because they think that people are judging them for their appearance. Others might have a hard time building up enough confidence to voice their opinion in front of numerous people. While home-schooling would eliminate the fear of social anxiety, I believe that it is better to face it and get used to it, rather than hide from it. Another reason to argue for home-schooling is because of reduced stress. Some may say that the levels of stress will be greatly reduced in the comfort of home without the constant distraction of other students and the demands placed on students by teachers. While this partially might be true, more stress is caused when a student does not know how to manage their time wisely. Home-schooled students are at a greater risk for this because their are also many distractions at home such as cell phones and social media.

Many things are taught in school other than just math, science, history, and language arts. School teaches many important life values that teens will need for when they are an independent adult. Some of these values are impossible for home-schooled students to learn, simply because it is a different environment. Although the idea of home-schooling sounds like the most beneficial option, many people do not realize that home-schooled students have to face their own type of challenges that they will have to overcome. For these reasons I cannot stand for home-schooling. In this case, I will admit that old school beats new school.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
5593451440F8,"The majority of students have to walk the dreadful halls of one's school everyday for seven hours to receive an education, but some schools offer students the option to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from this because students would potentially gaining more free time, avoid social conflicts, be more successful in the classroom, and have a healthier lifestyle.

By the time students arrive at school and by the time students departure, morning has passed into late afternoon. One reason why students would benefit from classes at home would be the potential extra free time students would gain. If classes were attended at the comfort of home, students could work at one's own pace which means each student could design what time class starts and finishes which would allow students to be more active in ones community, make more time for relationships, and have more time to find ones passions.

The classroom can be negative space filled with hate and social conflicts. Although school classrooms touch on these negative topics, which can relate to real world problems that can help a student cope with hate, students would overall still benefit from class at home. Not all students have the same values or personalities which can lead to students exchanging hateful words to one another which could put ones mental state and self confidence at risk. If classes were attended at home, students lives would benefit by avoiding unnecessary hate and potentially have a more stable mindset and happier life.

A majority of students lives in a school's classroom is a 25:1 ratio, which means students do not receive as much attention from teachers as one should. If classes were online or through video conferencing, it would benefit student's academic life because the student would directly contact the teacher and not have to fight for the teacher's attention, which would result in being more successful in the classroom.

Since the school day begins so early, it has effected the sleeping schedules of students which is effecting students efficiency in and outside the classroom. Another reason why students lives would benefit from class at home would be that since the student could design ones schedule, that extra time could not only benefit students social lives but, also their sleep schedule, which would result in a healthier life style. Alongside sleep, what is put into ones body also effects ones mood and work efficiency. Some students simply do not have time in the morning to pack ones lunch, which results in those students purchasing school lunch which majority of the time consists of chips and french fries which does to give the body the right energy or those students do not eat at all. If classes were attended at home students would be able to eat healthy lunches which benefit the health of students allowing students to have more energy to focus on ones schoolwork and passions.

In conclusion, schools should offer students the option to attend class at home because it will benefit the lives of the students by potentially gaining free time, avoiding social conflicts, being more successful in the classroom, and having a healthier style which will potentially make students lives improve while still receiving an education.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
07414A338814,"Should students being to able to attend classes from home.? I think students shouldn't being able to attend classes from home. This is not a good benefit for students for three reasons; students can make some tricks for pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing the homeworks on online and the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online. I believe if students being able to attend online classes from home, they can make some tricks only for pass the classes on online and they will not really learn anything of the classes. however, other people say this is a good benefit because is more easy for the students take and pass the classes. I think those people are wrong because take online classes is looks like easy but it's not, this would be difficut for many students. Furthermore, some students can have trouble doing the homeworks on online because the online classes can be unsuccessful since some computer issues or the computer ruin when the student is in the middle of the half hour of the online class. some people may be think students can not have this type of problems if they buy the high price of computer mark. I think they're wrong because it doesn't matter the price mark of the computers, some times the computer just ruin for some broken tools inside of the compuers or others electronic programs and the people doesn't know about it. In addition, teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online because the teachers have to find many ways about, how they can teach the class for the students understand really well. Teachers have to learn how to make homework, how to show informations that the students need to know and other things. Some people say the teachers already know how to work on the internet and the students will understand better the teacher, but this isn't true because the teachers some times have trouble too, they need to learn many programs for making successful work and the teachers are not 100% sure that students understand the class. In conclusion, students shouln't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they're smart for making tricks for pass the classes from online or video conferencing, some students can have trouble doing the homework on online and the teachers will have more work to do for teaching the class on online.

1294A6CEEAC5,"A wise men once said,""

That schools offer distance learning as a option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferesing.

First of all online schools will benefit all students. because,this way they won't have excuses to be tardy,they will also have more energy to complete their asignments. This way they will have more time for all of their subjects and no excuses because they had enouph time to gain energy to work on all of their subjects.

Second If students go to online schools their will be less trafic on the roads,People will be able to get on time to their jobs since they will be no buses causing traffic,online schools may be beneficial to all those who are always late to work and they will be less accidents.

Some my argue that online schools will not be beneficial because teachers,bus drivers and janators may loose their jobs online schools migth benefit students but it won't benefit schools staff's.

Finally although Students might benefit from online schools it may be better, If they still attend to regular schools so that way they will know how to sociolaize and interract with others. online schools should apply when they're snow days or problems with the weather so that way students will not get behind and always be caugth up in all of their subjects.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
9165D265E932,"Everyone loves the idea of being able to stay home and complete all of their work from home. Sounds good right? Well it might not be as good as you think it would. Being home schooled, as some would call it, is not as beneficial as someone would think. Yes, the idea of having to wake up in the morning and go to school is hard for most people, but in reality going to an actual physical school can help you in many ways. Some people argue that even though this might be true it's still better for kids to do their work at home. I believe that students will not benefit from attending classes from home; in fact, it will probably hurt the students more than it should by not helping them prepare for the real world.

Most students dislike the idea of waking up in the morning and going to school, but they don't realize that school will eventually help them prepare for the real world. In every single class offered at school, from math to art, each class is able to teach their students something valuable that will help them succeed in the future. For example, it's very important that everyone no matter their age has good communication skills and is able to work well with others. If kids don't attend school then how are they going to be able to strengthen these important skills if they're at home. It's very important for someone to have these skills in order for them to function in the real world. Imagine getting a part time job at your favorite cafe and then getting fired because you can't communicate well and work with your fellow employees. That would be horrible and could potentially happen again because of the lack of basic skills. By going to school we can assure that kids learn these skills and will be able to do well on: job interviews, be able to communicate with others, and work well with anyone they meet. Time goes by fast and sooner than later kids will grow up and venture out into the real world we must make sure they are ready; and this can only be done if they attend school regularly.

We all have that one subject that stresses us so much our heads feel like they're going to explode any minute. Well by attending a physical school it may help you get some of the stress off. Schools have a day where both teachers and students can meet in order to do missing work or get the extra help they need. My school for example offers a specific class called lancer time where kids get a pass from their teachers and go to them for any reason possible. If you still need help then you can stay after school on a specific day and there is transportation provided. This is very convenient because if at any given moment a student needs help with something they can go and get it. Home schooled students don't have this option because they are being taught at home and arent' attending a school. This is very inconvenient because what would happen if a student needs help with something, they won't be able to get the help they need. If you attend a physical school then it's going to be very easy for you to get the help you need whenever you need it. Another way is by going to a class full of people you can get someone, like a friend, to help you and then you can both compare work to see if you are doing it right. If you're home schooled then you don't really have the option to have your friend help you or have any way of making sure your work is correct. That being said it's better for students to go to an actual physical school, so that they are able to get the help they need in order to succeed.

Just like every person is different every teacher will also be different. Some take their time explaining things while other teach so fast you don't get the chance to take notes. That being said if students are able to attend classes from home then they will be able to self pace themselves especially in classes that are hard for them. Let's say they're not that good at math, if they're at home they can take their time in order for them to fully understand the concept. By allowing them to do the work at home we are helping them more, than by sending them to school and watching as they don't understand anything because of how fast the class pace is. Another thing being, if they're at home they will focus much better unlike school where one can barely focus due to how loud some people can be. This will have a big impact on how they function, at school they might not focus due to all of the noise,and fail, but at home it's quiet and they will be able to focus way better. We all want our students to do well in school and the only way to ensure that is if we allow students to attend classes from home.

In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending classes from home because they aren't going to be well prepared to venture out into the real world. Everyone needs an important set of skills in order for them to function and this can only be done by attending an actual physical school. We should all make sure that every single students is well prepared for the world. We want them to accomplish great things and be able to feel happy about what they accomplished. That being said the only way for students to feel that way is by sending them to school. Even though the idea of being able to attend classes from home sounds really good it will not help you prepare. It's more important to go to an actual school to learn the necessary things you will need than by doing classes from home and not be prepare for the real world.    ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
FD0061B1786E,"Do you like waking up early everyday to go to school? Do you like the school environment? Do you sometimes wish that you could learn at home instead of at school? Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would have less distractions and less stress on them.

To begin with, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would have less distractions. The environment of school is usually distracting because the students usually distract each other. They start drama with each other. If students come to school to give their attention to drama instead of actively learning in a classroom, there is no point in going to school. Also, all the rules and limitations that schools have tend to be a distraction as well. Students are focused on things like what they should wear that won't get them dress coded or how they aren't allowed to use the restroom at certain times. If students are focused on things like this, they won't focus on learning.

Secondly, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it could minimize stress. One stress that students have is waking up early everyday. Most students don't get enough sleep and it isn't even their fault. Some have extracurricular activities and get home late. Then, they have homework to do so they end up going to sleep late. To add on, home is a more comfortable environment. There is always so much going on in school that stresses students. When you are at home, most of the stresses go away. Also, it is a safe place. For example, most bullying happens in school. Bullying is one of the worst stress causes and people are always trying to find a solution for it or to minimize it. If we can attend classes at home, many students wouldn't have to suffer from it and that would be one less stress.

People with the opposite opinion may say that at home students will be easily distracted and will have so much more freedom that they won't get any learning or work done. Although that could be a possibility, studies show that when you give someone many limitations and rules, they tend to break the rules more than the usual. On the other hand, people with more freedom tend to break the rules less. They also might say that at home classes could affect their social skills, but school isn't the only place or way to develop social skills. Students could go out into the real world and talk to older people with different mentalities or get a job and start getting experience with finances.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it would be less distracting and less stressful. Education in school today is not taken as seriously as back then. Students don't come to learn anymore and end up distracting others who do. Students taking classes from home could benefit them in so many ways. Do you believe that students could benefit from this? If so, in what other ways could it benefit them?",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
292E4A40F481,"The world today is drastically different than it was a 100 years ago. We have vehicles that can fly over over continents in hours; communicators that lets you talk with whoever you want, whenever you want; and machines that produce moving images just for our entertainment. Almost everything is different, everything except our education system. That is the one part of our society with little to no change since the 1920s. Students are still excepted to sit in rows, are still overloaded with information, and still go home and slave away for a passing grade, just so that they can receive a piece of paper. They're treated as nothing more than information processing system that can be shipped away after their time is up. It's time for a change, and distance learning, and the benefits that come with it, is a step in the right direction. Distance learning will not only let students manage their time, but also lets them have more options and a better understanding.

One of the main problems plaguing students today is the fact that they simply do not have enough time. Most students have clubs, sports, or even jobs to go to after school. Then they have to work on a seemingly endless piles of assignments and study for upcoming tests. Between these activities and wasting seven hours at school, students rarely have time for themselves. They almost never get to spend time with their friends and family, relax in front of a TV, or even sleep. Distance learning would help them with this. They would be able to take classes leisurely, be able to choose their own schedule, and learn how to manage their time. Students, with this new found free time, could finally get the eight hours of sleep that they are supposed to, discover new interests, and might even give back by putting time into volunteering. Distance learning would help them in the long run, by teaching them time management skills, as well as letting them take care of themselves.

Another reason why distance learning is better is because of the amount of choices. Online classes typically offer more courses, or more advanced courses that schools normally don't. These classes let students expand their knowledge and explore new subjects that they might be interested in. Additionally, some students may not have enough space in their school schedule to fit in all the classes they want take. For example, even though Astronomy has always interested me, my school doesn't offer the course, and I didn't have space in my schedule. Thankfully, a local online college offers the course, So, next year, I'm taking Astronomy online, a class that I'm really excited about. Now I get to pursue my interest while still being able to take all my required classes.

Finally, contrary to popular belief, distance learning would not deter learning, but instead improve it. The fact is, in 2020, learning is vastly easier with technology. One could simply look up a difficult vocabulary word, watch a video to understand a concept, or graph a complicated polynomial. Learning from home, you have access to resources that lets you do all these and more. Additionally, students will not have to rely on their teachers to understand the material. Teachers are extremely vital to a student's education and success, but can also hold them back from achieving their full potential. Some teachers spoon feed concepts to their students, insisting on only doing the problem their way, while others don't care what their students do as long as they get the correct answer. While just examples, both versions of these teachers exist in virtually every student's learning experience. Online learning will remove this problem and will force students to think for themselves instead of mindlessly repeating information or putting something random on the paper. With distance learning, the student's ability to understand and process information is heightened, not hindered.

With distance learning, students' minds could be opened; they could have more options and more flexibility. Distance learning will not only benefit students right now, but also in the long run, in the real world. America is the gold standard when it comes to almost everything: we have the best movies, the best songs, the best jobs, but what about the country's future? What about the new generation that needs change in order for improvement? When it comes to the education system, distance learning is a change in the right direction in order for the future of America to succeed. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8F23D8E6AC8B,"Education is vital, which is why children are required to attend school. Schools are meant for students to prepare themselves for college and learn essential skills for the workplace. However, sometimes, students are unable to be physically present at school. A couple of schools offer distance learning, which allows students to attend classes from home through online or video conferencing. I believe that students would benefit from having the option to attend classes from home, because they could keep up with classwork even when sick or away and students who live in remote locations could still have an education.

The first reason for my argument is students could stay on track even when they are not present. Nearly all students have dealt with having illness, leaving for a family trip, or having other personal issues that resulted in missing class time. Because of that lost class time, a student may find upon returning that they missed out on a critical lesson. This can result in frustration for the student if they can't be caught up on the lesson quickly. With the use of distance learning, students can view lectures through online conferencing and ask their teacher questions while away, which would be much more beneficial than simply reading a textbook. Additionally, because of the growing use of applications like Google Classroom in schools, students can complete their in-class assignments alongside their classmates. I have used a similar online learning system that was greatly beneficial for me. While I was on vacation with my family, I used my computer from the house I was staying at to receive assignments, notes, and messages from my class. Because of this, I was able to return to school a week later and perform well on the material.

The second reason for my argument is students who live in remote locations or have inflexible schedules can still attend school. By allowing distance learning for these students, like my previous argument, they can keep up with their education despite their circumstances. A similar concept in the workplace is VoIP, which stands for Voice over Internet Protocol. If an employee is in a remote location but still needs to keep up with their company, they use VoIP calling to meet with coworkers over the internet and collaborate on whatever work needs to be completed. Likewise, a student who lives in an area that may be too far away from any schools can use online conferencing to stay connected. It may even be cheaper than having to pay for transportation and supplies at a school they can't attend easily.

Some may argue that providing students with the option of distance learning may allow them to be lazy. Because the student is not actually present in the classroom, the teacher has little control over what the student does. I agree that there are likely to be several students that would not make efficient use of the online learning system, which is why it should not be employed for every student that asks for it. Rather, distance learning should be used for the students who need it. They will understand that distance learning is their way of attending class and will take their work seriously because of it.

In conclusion, the inclusion of distance learning in the education system will greatly benefit many students. For students that normally attend school but must miss days for whatever reason, they can stay on track from home. For students that can't attend school because of where they live or what they do, they can still have an education with their peers. It is because of these reasons that I hope additional schools implement the option for distance learning. No matter what circumstances arise, students will still have access to their education, an important asset.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
E0326A44EAA7,"Benefits of Distance Learning?

While technology is increasing as well as improving throughout school systems, it has given students more opportunities to have classes outside of school. Although this is not a bad thing, there are not many good outcomes to students working outside of the school environment. Students would have no behavioral skills, social skills, or work ethic.

In school, students learn how to behave in public and around others. However, students taking online courses will be in the comfort of their own home and their demeanor will not change. Due to the fact that they are at home, the only way they can receive any form of discipline is from their parents. Students will not receive the discipline that schools give which teach students how to act around other people as well as out in public. Students need to be taught code switching, to learn what behavior is right and wrong. Schools are one of the most important places to learn behavioral discipline.

Having online courses for school would not give students the opportunity to become social and interactive with others. Throughout a students' life, elementary through high school, they are learning social skills as well as interacting with other students. Without being around others to interact with, they will lack skills that will be needed for the rest of their lives. Having social skills will help them in the work force. To be able to have a job, students will have to speak to customers, coworkers, and bosses. Without social skills, they will not be prepared for life outside of school as well as talking with new people. Online schools do not give them the opportunity to be able to communicate with others and have the skills needed to survive as an adult.

It is important for students to have a schedule and due dates for work. This creates good work ethic and time management skills. Having classes outside of school makes for bad student work ethic and most importantly, laziness. Although online schools have due dates and schedules, students will not take it as seriously as they would in school. Students will not only work at their own pace but, they will do their work when they feel like working. Online school gives students freedom to do what they want, when they want. Therefore, they will continue to work this way and will not have any kind of good work ethic.

As online schools are increasing through out school systems and classrooms, it is not beneficial to students.

Not having students in a school will not give them all the requirements they will need for prepare them for their adult lives. Students need to be able to work well with others, have good work ethic, and be able to code switch when needed.     ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Online class are not easy not anybody can pass thats why they not meant for everyone. Being home schooled is nothing like regular school you don't have to wake early, you get to choose what time you do your work.

Not having to wake up early everyday is nice but knowing you have to get something done right after you start is not fun and specially if you not getting the help you need not being able to ask the questions you have makes it a lot harder, you also have to try and do your best because if you fail you can't talk to your teacher about helping you make it up and helping you pass it like regular school.

If you are home schooled you missing out the fun in regular schools not talking about class meaning all the fights, all the fire drills, all the dances and friends sometimes having trouble in regular school i always tell myself i need to drop out or take online classes but home schooled is not just for everybody and probably at least 60% of home schooled students either don't finish or go back to regular school.

66259133A8BF,"Through the use of technology, remotely anything is possible. Everything is at our fingertips, providing comfort and complete bliss. It is easier than ever to get things done from remotely anywhere in the world. All areas of the globe are adapting to this ever growing phenomenon. It only makes sense that the question of whether or not technology should be incorporated into schools, and to what extent, arises. There are many benefits to adding technology in the classroom that can help make the teachers' as well as the student's lives easier, such as the use of online classes. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to learn at their own pace, easily make up work on classes they missed, and give them more independence.

Allowing students to take online classes would tremendously benefit them since they will have the opportunity to learn at their own pace. Not all kids learn the same way and at the same pace, which is why alternative methods of teaching and learning need to be provided to cater for everyone. Distance learning with permit kids to take charge of their learning and learn when they feel most comfortable. Getting up early at ungodly hours to get ready for school wastes a lot of precious sleep time for full time students. The weight of staying up to study the night before before plus the dread of getting to class early in the morning does not result in a pleasant and healthy form of leaning. Rather, it creates problems for both the students as well as the teachers. Because of online learning, students will also have the opportunity to pause and listen to the lessons provided over and over again until they understand what is being taught. This allows for the students to go over parts of the lessons they are having trouble with and make sure they really understand. In addition, the kids will be able to take notes at their own pace without having to worry about scrambling to get everything down. This eliminates the stress and anxiety that comes with balancing getting everything down and paying full attention to the lesson being taught.

With the help of online classes, students wouldn't lose as much class time on days that they have to miss school. Everyone has some off days. Whether it be because of a sickness, a family emergency, or simply a mental health day, students tend to miss a decent among of school when it comes to unforeseen situations. However, with online classes, students would be able to tune in to what they missed while they were away. The classes offered online would allow the students to stay up to date with what is happening in their classes and would ensure that they don't fall behind simply because of circumstances that were out of their control. If someone is diagnosed with a serious health issue, resulting in them misses tons of classes, they would still have the chance of making up all their work and catching up through the help of online classes. Online classes are able to limit students' stress of making it to class during difficult times in their lives and able to focus on themselves while simultaneously getting their schoolwork done as well. It is crucial that the school system understands and provides for students that wish to learn but are not able to because of life problems. Lastly, online classes would also increase the attendance rates for the school since the kids would be able to tune in through the comfort of their homes, any time during the day. Online classes would assist kids by making sure they don't miss too much of school and are still at the same level as their peers.

Some may argue that allowing kids to learn on their own through the use of online classes would remove the structure they need in their lives and cause them to become lazy. However, offering online school to students can actually make them more independent and self sufficient. Students would be able to create their own schedule and hold themselves accountable to it. This creates a realistic environment for them since this is what happens in the workforce. They would be able to learn wherever and whenever they deem fit, allowing them to incorporate more school into their lives. Having so much structure in students' lives creates an unrealistic perception of how the rest of the world functions. After school ends, there are no more set schedules in people's lives anymore. So it would only make sense for students to get ready for that now. People also tend to counter that online classes would not have the same effect as regular classes and therefore would not benefit students. However, online classes would be incredibly beneficial for kids who simply cannot go to school due to life problems. In addition, some online classes are way cheaper than classes offered on campus. This gives students a chance to obtain a more affordable education and still stay on track.

Allowing kids to take online classes provides many benefits for everyone. Student are able to learn at their own pace, they don't have to worry about missing work due to missing classes, and they are able to gain more independence all thanks to online classes. Being able to adapt to the technological advances is important if we all want to continue moving forward.

0A821CBEEBB1,"Ever been too sick to be at school and you miss a lot of work or you feel that sitting in school hours a day wastes too much of your time? Imagine being able to do all your school work from home. Some schools offer distance learning for students online or on a video chat, which I think would be very convenient.

There are times when students get too sick to even leave the house; reasons could be they are contagious and don't want anyone else getting sick or not even being able to leave their own bed. One thing about being sick at home is students will definitely miss work from school, grades might even drop and they will not even be ready to take any exams or tests because they have not learned the material yet. Being on a video chat with the teacher could feel like the student is there and actually able to see what new lessons they need to learn. The student could ask the teacher any questions he or she might have and participate in the classroom. Video chats would also save sick students from a bunch of extra work stacking up and they will be less likely to have their grades drop from an A to a C.

What about students who just don't want to go to school because seven or more hours a day just feels like its too much or have other important responsibilities?

They might work two jobs or have to stay home with their sick mother and going to school will just crunch up their day making it harder to breathe and take a break. Online classes could save the student time and money, so that he or she could get more done in one day. They could get a break from having to be transported to and from school, which takes time out of their day as well. But having online classes could mean that there are times when the student might just give up because there isn't any teacher that could collect the work which could lead to slacking off and becoming lazy. There could be an easy solution to that problem too, having online due dates will keep the student from not getting their work done and not learning.

In the end, students go to school to learn but the same could be done at home. For whatever reason any student might have they will still be picking up new information and have more convenience in their life with video chatting or online classes. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5B7839D9261F,"No, i think students wouldn't benefit from taking online classes at home because, taking from classes at home maybe good for people who have social issues, for some people they are more comfortable at home, and some people doing school at home might be easy for them to start a job.

I think classes are good for people who have really bad social issues to the point where they dont like talking in public or to new people, there are other options for that like sports or clubs or just spending time with family for the most part,and for people who have social issues shouldn't be rushed into a school with people because that could be terrifying for them could make them freak out so let them do school and slowly work on their social issues.

So, people sometimes arent comfortable at school but, if you did online classes where your by yourself or with family your more comfortable. Sometimes school can stress you out with test, classwork, participation, lack of sleep if you have a job while being at a public school, time, missing the bus if you ride one, its just the responsibilities that people have while in public school, if you did online school you could work at your own time and get it done, you might not have a teacher around but thats why you have an adult or someone that can help you.

For some people in high school mostly it hard to keep a job because, it's tiring, stressed out and even though you can tell them what days you work and the days you can't it's still hard going to school straight to work Because you can't be focused on one and ruin the other one, here to make it more clear if you have a job right after school and your grades are decent but sense your focused on your job more then school your going to start failing and thats really hard to do for some people but not a lot of them it might just be me but trying to good at multiple things is difficult but, if you did online classes it wouldnt be as bad you could have a full time job and do school at your own speed, it's good for young people to have jobs so when their ready to go out in the world to see what it's like they will be ready because, they'll have experience, then for people who didn't and they'll have a better chance of getting a job if you have experience then some with none.

Therefore, students wouldn't benefit from taking online classes, i think they would take the chance while they could and do online school with their own reasons, maybe not exactly like like but maybe similar to mine, like if i had a choice of doing online school I would most certainly take that chance while i could.      ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
6ABC44A06B02,"Do students get benefits from being able to attend classes from home?

In my opinion being able to attend classes from home is a great idea, by let students take classes from their homes, they could get extra time to help their families in different ways, one of those ways to help their families would be; get a job. Students who decides to work and help their families; porting money, somehow they get more opportunities and experiences in life. Those students that help their families with money, somehow they are learning how to be independent.

By providing classes online, somehow we are helping the parents to keep their sons and daughters in the right path, because sometimes students choice to be with the wrong people, by let students attend classes from home, their parents could be aware of what kind of people they are meeting with. By accepting the rules, students will learn responsibility and discipline as well.

As a matter of facts, students have the opportunity to spend time with their families, as we all know the support of your family is the most important thing a student can have. Somehow your family have a great influence in your future, and spending time with them would get you in the right path. However, some students don't have the support from their families, which means those students got to work and sometimes they don't have the opportunity to come to school, give them the opportunity to take classes online would help them to get prepare for their life and most important;their future.

In facts, online classes would help those students that are interest in continue their studies in the University or College, by give them time to prepare themselves in an specific area, and get knowledge in that area. For example, if a student is interesting in human services, he/she could get a job related with that area, specializing her/himself with what she/he wants for her/him life. Making it easier for her/him in the College or University because she/he would be prepare for whats coming in the future.

On the other hand, some students don't have any support from their families and they don't speak enough English, which means the can't come to school because of their jobs. Online classes would be a great start for those students to learn English and prepare themselves. Somehow this will show the students that they are capable of so much more, the only thing they need to do is work hard, and they will accomplish all their goals. Hope is a great thing we all should have, and have hope that everybody could become or accomplish all their goals, and all those people can change the world; it means a lot to me.

As a result of online classes; not only students will get benefit, but the country as well. By giving online classes, somehow we are preparing students, students who will make a different in the future, students who will make a better U.S.A for our kids. Therefore, we should give this opportunities to students who wants to become better, day by day.

79CDFD13AE8D,"Per the use of technology, the world has been evolving like never before. With the use of interfaces such as Skype, Facebook, and WhatsApp, the modern world is capable of communicating ideas with each other from across the globe. Another field that technology is starting to affect is the education system. Day by day, schools start to become more technologically advanced, switching chalkboards for the intelligent Promethean, and ditching notebooks for savvy and versatile laptops. Technology even allows students to take classes that would normally be taught in the classroom, online. People who are not familiar with this technology may think that online classes are not good for society, but they are wrong. Students benefit from online classes because they allow students to learn with extenuating circumstances, they allow students to have more classes as well as flexibility, and online students still get the same accomplishments as other students in the regular system.

Though they don't necessarily get the everyday experience, online students still acquire the same accomplishments while not experiencing too many differences from the regular school system. If online students were to take the mandatory classes required to graduate such as math, science, english and history, then there would be no reason for them not to graduate with the same high school diploma as everybody else. If students really wanted to, they could also take classes that interest them or apply to a more specialized career, such as the automotive or medical fields. Online students still learn the same curriculum as everybody else, with the four basic subjects. Obviously, online students are not allowed to take Advanced Placement and other college level classes online, but it is possible to graduate without taking any college level classes. Having the same diploma and credits as everyone else means that online students have the same eligibility for college or other higher level education courses as students in the regular school system. People may say that online students don't get the same experiences, but that's wrong. Online students interact with their teacher and fellow online students in exchanging ideas via live class on microphone. This exchanging of ideas and live interactions are relatively similar to those of an everyday classroom in the school system.

Online classes give more everyday flexibility to students as well, and are capable of fitting into the schedule of any kind of person. Since there is no set schedule for online classes, online students are able to choose any class they want at any time they want. This is important for students taking these classes, as their lives no longer revolve around the school schedule, but rather their online classes fit their needs. Online classes can even be helpful for students that are in the regular school system that don't have enough classes open to fit in a necessary subject in order to graduate. For example, many students take Physical Education over the summer or online as it does not seem necessary to them or they have other classes to replace it with that are more important to them. Finally, if a student were to be incredibly behind on their journey to graduating, they could take online classes so that they could catch up with their peers. This would allow the student to graduate with their friends, and complete a high school education.

Finally, online classes allow students to continue to educate themselves, even with extenuating circumstances. Online classes cost a lot less money. Since all you need for online classes are a laptop and a good mindset, without the expenses of school supplies, textbooks, and possibly fees needed to pay for an extracurricular of some sort, online classes are a viable option, especially for low income families. Speaking of low income families, if a student has to work a job in order to support his own family, online classes are able to fit right into their schedule so that they can educate themselves and support their family at the same time. If a student is suffering from a medical condition, then online classes would be a solid alternative for them. Through online classes, they would be able to learn from the comfort of their home.

Online classes benefit students because they allow for students to learn in situations beyond their control, allow for students to take more classes, and still gain the same experience, accomplishments, and education as students in the regular school system. Everybody in the world deserves a chance at learning, and technology has the power to provide education to those that think they are not able to learn. If everyone was able to learn through whatever way, it would make the world a much better place. Graduation rates would become higher, and education would become accessible to everyone. Websites such as Khan Academy, College Board, and Quizlet provide interactive learning websites for those that need that extra push towards education. Technology continues to improve the world, and it our job as the current generation to preserve the power and influence of technology for the future generations that will experience it.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
B9871E7972A3,"Educating the youth and next generation may take a drastic change. Distance learning, learning from home, should be a new way of education for students. In online learning, students would learn from home by taking courses online and using videos to educated themselves. Students would no longer be going to classrooms to learn which would actually be a good thing. Using online learning for a teaching method would be very useful as it would stop social issues at school, allow students to go at their own pace, and allow students to learn more information and use other sources.

Online learning would out right stop most social issues at school. Bullying would be reduced for students since they're not forced to sit next to or even see a rude kid every day. Kids could only hang out and surround themselves with who they want to be around and don't have random seats or random partners and table mates. Having students not go into a classroom and all come together would also stop the spread of diseases and colds. Several schools have began online learning since the corona outbreak started to try and reduce the spread of that highly infectious disease. Another big social benefit, would be that kids can't be disruptive during classes and talk when the teacher is talking or talking to other kids and disrupt their learning envierment. Online learning would fix many have the social problems we have at school today.

Having students do online learning would allow for students to go at their own pace. In classrooms, the teacher chooses the pace at which they go at, and students have to follow it even if it's to fast for them and they get left behind. With online learning tho, it allows students to pause and rewind videos or even go back and understand something they didn't fully understand. Students could play videos again and again and review the videos as many times as they need to so they can understand, something that can't be done in a classroom. In classrooms, the teacher will just say things once, review it a little and explain, then move on. Online learning would allow all students to be able to fully understand and grasp a concept.

Online learning would allow students to learn more information and uses other sources to learn. Some kids who enjoy a concept, or just want to learn as much information about something as possible, are limited to how much the teach talks about it. With online learning students can explore the internet and other sources to find all sorts of information on a topic. In classrooms, teachers have a teaching method they use and just have to hope it works for everybody. In online learning, there is several ways of learning like watching a video, reading notes, and using a review game. Online learning would allow students to use each method and whatever they think helps them best they can use.

In conclusion, online learning should be an available option for students since would stop social issues at schools, allow students to go at their own pace and understand, and options to learn more information and use other sources. Some people fear that having online learning would result in kids not learning and just sitting at home playing games instead of school work at home. This would not be a big effect of online learning however, kids who are in school typically skip classes and walk around or don't pay attention. No matter what they will be kids who won't learn and try but online learning would not add to this factor. Online learning would prove very beneficial to the youth in education and making the next generations smarter. This is a new age, and we must use our new technical advances to our advantage, and then technology will keep getting better.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
67984D18D30D,"If you were able to take online classes wouldn't you take them. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Distance learning is a program that allows you to take classes by way of online instead of physically attending a class. Taking online classes has many benefits that contribute to your personal life and also your student life. Online classes allows you to work at your own pace, have more time for yourself, and be able to work without any distractions. I believe that distance learning is a great option for schools to offer students.

Physically attending a class can sometimes be stressful. Teachers only have a certain amount of time to teach you what they have plan for that day and they tend to rush you. But what some teachers don't understand is that everybody doesn't learn at the same speed. It takes some students longer to understand what they are teaching. If you take online classes you wouldn't have to worry about anyone rushing you, because you can work at your own pace.

When you attend a class you really don't have time to take care of yourself, especially if you have multiple classes in one day. When its time to leave school you probably have to go straight home because you have to write an essay or have other homework to do. Also if you play a sport that makes it harder, because you have to balance your life, school, and the sport that you play. With online classes it makes it so mush easier because you can get your work done early in the morning instead of waiting for school to start for you can go to class. Just think about the extra time that you could have.

Having classes with other people can be very distracting. In all your classes there's always going to be someone or something that is keeping you from focusing. At home you don't have to worry about anyone distracting you. With online classes you can do your work peacefully.

More schools should start offering distance learning to students. I believe that students would do better in school if they had online classes. Online classes gives them the chance to work alone and not be distracted by anything. Schools should allow students to choice if they want to take online classes. Everyone doesn't work at the same pace.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
C75B9C4FFEAD,"Home school is a benefit that anybody could have. Taking school at home would be better if you ask me, but it is not for everybody though.

Being home schooled is better then regular school because you got all day to do your work. Some people don't work as fast as others and need to work at a different pace. If you're home schooled you can watch TV and relax while doing your work at the same time, if you can multi-task. But Sometimes it could be a distraction from you doing all your work.

For an example, If you do home school you dont have to worry bout waking up early in the morning. People like me are not a morning person. Also if you missed the bus to school and got no transportation you're gonna be stuck at home. School could be on the other side of town and walking would take too long.

Attending classes online would give you the benefit of getting through school faster. Doing home school will help you graduate 2x faster then usual if you doing all your work right. My brother was home schooled for 2 years and graduated at six-teen. Another thing is you can look up answers online to your work.

When you get home schooled you dont have to worry about teachers telling you what to do, but until you get that video call on your laptop. You can pull out your phone and talk without somebody saying "" Put your phone up and stop talking"". But sometimes your teacher that assigns your work will have a group conference call with you and a few other people in the online classes you got.

Home school is better there's some downfalls for it. If you dont study and just look up everything online. Also you aint gonna have no friends to talk to nd joke around with while you doin your work. If your attention spand short home school is not for you.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
0640FE8DF9D6,"Imagine your alarm clock goes off and you get out of bed, and after doing your morning routine instead of grabbing your book bag to heading out and catching the bus for school instead you open your laptop and open up a video chat with your teacher to get your lesson of the day instead. This idea isn't and is referred to as distance learning. Distance learning already exists in most colleges such as Generic_School and has started to develop in high schools. Many have the impression that this could be the new way to do school work. Others believe that distance learning won't bring much of a change as it says it is and have a rather niche effect in schools. I strongly believe that distance learning can make a big difference in the learning environment.

Every year students end up missing days due to sickness or other matters. These sickly students almost always come back to loads of work to do that they can could not get done while they where out recovering. Distance learning can help with this near inevitable factor. Instead of students worrying about what work they're missing on their sick days they can open up their device and do the work from home. This same practice could also be used in scenarios such as snow days,tornadoes,floods or other bad weather that causes schools to shut down. This could also be the new way to combat schools having to add more school days to make up for the missed ones.

Focusing on other issues, what if you don't even have schools in your area? There are several kids out in the world that live in rural locations are so far from schools that it'd even be too much to send a bus out to bring them to school. This leaves rural students most of the time only two options:move to another house or be home schooled instead by a parent which doesn't give as good as a education as public schools. Home schooling can put a strain on the parent because most of the time it interferes with their jobs. It's unfair knowing that people fall short on education and opportunities compared to everyone else because of the area they live in. The implementation of distance learning can change this problem almost entirely for these students. Places like Australia already participate in this practice with some outback residents attending schools right form their house. No matter where you your house is, you should still be able to get your education

As great as distance learning sounds it, as with all decisions, does not come without drawbacks. Tackling possibly it's biggest problem, distance learning has a high technological dependency to function efficiently and having tech means spending lots of money.

Some schools just dont have the funds to afford technology to give to students which distance learning heavily relies on.

We should be well aware of the financial problem of this idea and maybe in time someone can find a way to make this method more accessible to the masses

Distance learning is a relatively new method on how people get their education. No matter the outside conditions, distance learning can still give students their assignments for the day. This idea in other countries has proven to go beyond and into remote places and provide education to places without schools. Even with the limitations is has now, I'm sure that the use of it will most likely spread in the future. I believe that within some years that distance learning could be a practical way to do school; in fact, it could even be the primary way to attend school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
00898D9FB10A,"Home school, this is a very popular subject nowadays. This is a program that benefits a lot of children around the world that for different circumstances they can't attend to a school building. But what happens when a child has the physical and mental capacity to attend school but still decides to have home school, are they going to have the same benefits as the rest of students that attend to school?

Every child has the right to be educated. There exists plenty of qualities and values that a student can develop in a classroom such as: honesty, friendship, respect, leadership, etc. These are just some of all the attributes a student can gain by attending to school, but one of the most important qualities that a human can learn is the interaction with others. This is because the world is based on that, every single day people interact with other people and learn form each other, this is the way the world works.

In school, students have to interact with their classmates and teachers day by day. There are group assignments were teachers put you in a group were nobody knows each other so they can work together and hopefully build a good friendship. Sports in school are also a great way to interact with others, teachers encourage students to participate in sport activities after school. If the student doesn't like sports there also are different clubs in school in which students can participate.

In conclusion the home school program can teach all the knowledge a student needs such as sciences or maths but, it doesnt teach the values and attributes a human needs. The future generations that the world need are correct people with good values that will help the progress of the world.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
A523560DD28C,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is a remarkable idea, many teenagers as well as children would benefit from this being put into place. Offering online classes and video conferencing taking place from home would not only have a positive impact on many students but parents as well. This advancement in technology should be installed in schools as soon as remotely possible because of the many responsibilities children already have, the increase in teenagers with part or full time jobs, and the immense amount of preparation for online college classes this would provide.

To begin, in school classes take around eight hours of every child's day, having online classes could potentially cut that number of hours in half. Thus allowing children to preform other responsibilities, such as, helping their parents with childcare of their younger siblings. Already both the parents and students are benefiting from online classes and video conferences made from home. A student has many responsibilities most would say school being the biggest, although that is not always how it is viewed. Past more than present students often had to drop out of school entirely in order to help the family, if this form of technology had existed then many more people would have had a chance to be successful.

Furthermore, there has been an increasing amount of teenagers with part or even full time jobs. All jobs available for full time high school students are night shifts. What this means is that a student would get out of school around approximately three in the afternoon, go straight to work, and get off around eleven or twelve at night. That process would be repeated many times throughout the week, leaving the student exhausted. In multiple cases school systems see a drop in grades from the students that are employed. Although, grades may suffer some students do not have a choice in whether they have a job or not. Not all parents are able to provide fro their children like they should, resulting in teenage employment. With online classes the student would be able to complete school work faster providing extra time to study, and allowing him or her to work earlier shifts in the day.

Lastly, the entire roll of high school is to prepare young adults for college. Many students decide to do general studies online through community colleges. They may find themselves struggling to maintain good grades without sitting inside a classroom. With the preparation they would receive from the distance learning program, they would not have to sweat it. Students would also learn important skills such as time management and an advanced acknowledgment of computers that would benefit them in future college classes.

On the other hand, distance learning could be seen as an easy way out. There would be without a doubt students that would neglect the system. Immature young adults would not even bother to do the work themselves, instead they would use sites such as Kahoot and Quizlet to complete their assignments. Another issue that would diminish at home learning would be the students without access to internet. In every plan there are flaws, but without a doubt the positives outweigh the negatives in this scenario .

In conclusion, distance learning programs should be offered and encouraged in every school nationwide. With these being installed and used properly, young students will flourish in the education department as well as the real world. Online schooling allows for students to take on more responsibilities such as family devotion and jobs. Before students were unaware of what online college courses threw at them, but with this being implemented they will be given a taste before making a decision. This advancement on technology has been on the rise fro many years now, it is well over time to demonstrate its effectiveness.                                 ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
946AC22B5C6E,"Going to school is a big part of everyones life, thats where most find their passion and decide what they want to do in the future, that where people find their life long friends. Most people have grown up going to school everyday, wouldnt it be weird if that just suddenly changed? Some schools are starting to offer distance school, this is where the students can learn from home online. While most think this is a good idea, the students would not benefit from learning at home. The students might have a hard time learning and can easily get distracted, not to mention all the experience they would miss out on. It would be hard to change this setting, all the work that was put into a school to make it better would all go to waste.

Students learn better when a teacher is there to help them learn. Some students need to have that one on one contact. They learn visually, the teacher needs to show them how to solve a problem. In math, its all writing and solving new equations, it can be hard to learn math without a teacher there to show you the right way. Some people will disagree and will say that online videos are the same thing, but they are not. When watching online videos, no one is there to check your work, making sure that everything is right. If a student doesnt understand the topic, they would have to search it up and they could find the wrong answer or it could be very confusing. One of my friends did online school for a year, and she told me that it was harder for her to learn at home and took her a while to learn certain topics without a teacher there to help her. Say a student wants to become a chemist, to learn in school, you do labs to help understand chemistry. At home, you can't do certain labs because you need special equipment and chemicals to complete the lab that you dont have at home. It is harder for me to learn online, I always need a teacher to help and show me what to do when I first learn a topic, its easier for me to understand. Students need a teacher to help them learn and understand a topic in school.

At school, students can get distracted, but in their mind, they know school is a place to learn. The environment that they are set in from the beginning helps them get put in the right mind set to learn. Changing that environment can effect how the student learns. At home, you can get distracted very easily because you have no one there to tell you to do your work or put your phone away. The student can do whatever they want at home, no one is there to stop them. Not only can they easily get distracted, they can cheat on tests and quizes. Searching up an answer is so easy because they have their phones and computers to help them. They aren't using their own knowledge to help them learn, which could effect them in the future when they actually need that knowledge for a job. Texting friends for the answers is one click away too. The student will never gain the knowledge by themselves and be able to retain it.

Sometimes kids have a hard time learning social skills or interacting with others, if they are at home they can never gain those skills. Being in a school environment can help kids interact with others everyday to make friends, they are forced to interact with other students. Making friends and keeping friends can be hard too with online school. Referring back to my friend who did online school, we started to drift because I stopped seeing her everyday and we didnt have time to hang out. She told me that she missed seeing her friends everyday and got very bored throughout the day at home. She also missed out on a lot of high school experience, missing pep rallies, homecoming, sports games, and even just sitting at lunch with her friends everyday. Those little things can make a big difference. Adults always say that high school was the best time of their lives, having so much fun, but if you physically dont go to school, you can miss out on a lot, or even experiencing the best time of your life.

Taking away the physical aspect of going to school can change a lot of things. Students can have a harder time learning and they can miss out on those special parts of life. What would be the point of the building then if everyone decided to do online school. The teachers would not be needed anymore. This is why offering online school can be challenging. Going to school helps the students a lot and would not be a good idea to take that away from them. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
E0C638AF8B52,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Many would argue online school or video conferencing would not be beneficial because their social skills may be declining due to not being with other students as much, however online school or video conferencing would be very beneficial because home is a quiet, comfortable space for students, obstacles for attending a school building would not effect online school such as traveling or sickness, and finally some students are victims of bullying that takes place.

All school buildings start school in the early morning and dismissal is in the late afternoon, and waking up can be difficult for many students, teenagers especially. Getting enough sleep is vital especially for growing young adults, and if students attended online school waking up would not be an obstacle they would have to face every morning. At home, students feel more comfortable because of the environment they have grown up in. Not only is being at home more comfortable for the student, typically these students guardians attend work therefore when they leave home, the student is left with a quiet place to do their school work properly. Of course a couple more factors play into the burning question; Why is online school and video conferencing exceptionally more beneficial than attending an actual school building for education?

Parents and guardians of students have jobs for a source of income to support their family. Some jobs require lots of traveling whether it might be across the world or a different state. Some families do not have the option to leave children at home while they travel, meaning the students would travel with them. The job does not wait for when the employee is ready, but only when the boss is ready. By saying this, a good percentage of students cannot make it to school due to family issues. When traveling, taking the device students use to complete school work with would help with getting work done on time. On the other hand if they attended school, students would have to learn all the material, get make-up work, and in general be behind all the other students that made it to class on time. Being behind would only cause major stress for the student. But family issues is not all; Sickness is a large factor in why online school and video conferencing is more beneficial too. Some teenagers happen to have a low immune systems, therefore they get sick many times throughout the year. Online school or video conferencing is an easy solution to this problem. If the child is sick and is participating in online/video conferencing school they would have all materials to catch up on their own with already with them.

Last but not least component is bullying. Bullying has been a very difficult problem for as long as people can remember. Sadly, a handful of students that attend a school building are victim to bullies. Bullies are made because some kids do not have a safe home to go to after school or they are starving and have no where to obtain food from. These students have anger and hate built up inside of them and devastatingly take it out on their own classmates and teammates. However, because online/video conferencing school is completed at home, there would be no worry of bullies. Students of online schools would not have to doubt for a second that they will get made fun of for what they wear or how they act. This would take a burden of stress that students should not have to have off of many of their shoulders.

Online school or video conferencing would be very beneficial because home is a quiet, comfortable space for students, obstacles for attending a school building would not effect online school such as traveling or sickness, and finally some students are victims of bullying that goes on. While ignoring the reasons above, there is still a variety of factors that play in why online school is more beneficial than attending a school facility. After reading this, show your parents or guardians would love and support you! Maybe they would ponder that online school might be a better route of success for you!",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
991D146A2AC0,"When students get sick, coming to school is never their first choice. In some cases, people can contract a sickness and become contaigous without feeling completely under the weather, and they may have enough energy to sit face to face with a teacher and learn. Lives can be unpredictable, so when a student misses a class, it may not be at the most ideal time. Students would benefit from the option of distance learning because it would be a good option for when they get sick and can't come to school, if they had some sort of injury or surgery that prevents them from coming to school for a period of time, or if they have a conflict with sports (such as traveling to a tournament intereferes with their classes) so that they can still hear the information being taught and see the activity occuring in class without actually being present in class.

Distance learning would be a great option for a student who tends to get sick often. With this option, the student can access the materials and information being provided in class without being there in person. In some circumstances, illness can make people extremly tired, or they may feel just fine and be bouncing off the walls with energy and they may need to expell some of it and put it towards school instead. With distance learning being provided, the student has access to resources that they normally wouldn't, while also getting to communicate with their teachers from the comfort of their own home. Also, many students could possibly feel stressed that they are missing assignments in their classes from having sick days, so this form of learning will help to allieviate the stress so that they can fully recover.

As well as the sickness, imapctful injuries and surgeries may happen during the school year, forcing the student to adapt to those circumstances. With the helpful tool of distance learning, students can be productive while stuck in bed resting up. Similarly to having illness, injuries can get to the point of being so severe that students may need to stay in bed and rest themselves. One contradicting example would be a student with a concussion, since some students may end up returning to school soon after it occurs. One may experience pain different from another, so if expectations are set differently by different students, teachers may get upset if a student doesn't utilize the distance learning feature.

And lastly, the distance learning resource would be extremely helpful to the student athletes who have to miss school due to a tournament or traveling to a tournamnet. As an athlete speaking from experience of having to make up a lot of schoolwork due to missing classes because of traveling, this option of distance learning would be greatly appreciated, as during many long carrides, I usually finish my homework in a matter of a few short hours, and play on my phone for the rest. Normally, I would have to go into school early or waste my studyhall making up work that I had missed. Now with the distance learning and option of video conferencing, my teachers can see why I am unable to be in school so that they wont potentially get mad that I am not present in class.

This option of distance learning would be an absolute game changer for students who tend to get sick, injured, have to get surgeries, play travel sports, or are involved in anything else that applies to missing school for an activity. Many students would benefit from being able to take their classes from the comfort of their bed, and would appreciate having this as an option. Many parents would be delighted to know about this feature and learn that the schools do, in fact, care about the well being of their children. Not only will the students benefit from being able to utilize this feature, but the school system will be praised for allowing this to become and option. With distance learning, the students will feel valued and respected that the school has given them another option to recieve their learning, and it will be greatly appreciated.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9EB7D09C785B,"Take classes Online can help busy students, but is you are interested in take this classes can help you too. Take classes online is a good opcion for busy people because some times they do not have enough time to make food, do the homework and go to school, sometimes they need money so they need to work, and they look at this like an obstacle that keep them away from school. By taken classes online they can make a better sketch, eat at home, do the homework, have more time to do the things that they need to do at home. For example if you have a baby, you can take care of you baby, and they the classes olnine at home. Also, if you need to go to work, you can go to work and in your free time take the classes online. Another reason is that some students live far away from the school, and they do not have a car or transportation, is more easy for them to take the classes online in the comfort of their home. Also, if they are in a normal school and they want to keep learning by the summer they easily can take the classes online or the video conferencing. In my opinion I think that the classes online or the video conferencing can a lot of students, if they are busy or if they are interented in this classes they can take it too.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
60B64507D3BD,"The most important goal for a student is to complete their academic studies, but for many of them this is a challenge, becuase they came from others contries, some of them have children or a job and can not complete all the classes at school. For these reasons many schools decides to start doing online classes, and this is a great desicion for students, because in that way they can be organizing their time, be increasing their academic education and also this help them with the school credits, and in that way be able to graduate.

Online classes are a good opportunity, since they can be able to take the classes at home, and they can be organize, concentrate, paying attention to the online teacher designed, also they have to be doing assigments, quizzes and a test each Unit,but in a flexible way. They can been more responsible with their homework's and research important information that can help them be more sucessful in classes. Online teacher are always disponible to help each students, and that is great, because they are learning as a class.

The idea of make this dream true for these special students was to beneffict them in a academic way, so students can continue their studies and they have the help of the teacher's, they explain the class and make groups that introduce them to others students, in that way each of them are learning and increassing the ability of interact with others that are doing the same challenge and feel that they are not the only ones who are making this dream true. Every student can show their strengts and love of studies by doing everything that is posible to complete all their requirements.

This strategy apports a unique facility for these students that are doing they last school year, and are needing to complete to many classes and credits. For this metho students can be compleating all the required classes and with the same value of a regular class taking at a school. This not make students less than others, or doesn't means that they are not learning in a right way, because is not true, they are equal to the others students and are learning the same information as the others. Onlines classes are part of a school.

In my personal opinion, I conclude that students who attent classes from home by way of online or video conferencing are taking a great desicion, because this make feel students that is not anything in this world that we as students can not make, we have a lot of good options to continue been succesful in life and be seeing as student's.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could lay in bed all day and still get and education?

Why should people be allowed to take web classes at home; Because it could help the family, it could make it easier for some people and what about the people who have a mental problem or a disability they could even get an education.

I think people should be allowed to attend classes from home. For some families it is hard to make money, and instead of sending their children to school, they have to work. It would help the family if the kids could go to school and still help out at home. They could for example: wake up, go to work or help out the family, come home and do school, that way they could still help out the family, but at the same time get and education so they at one point can stand on their own two feet.

People should also be allowed to take online classes if they are having trouble with the family or something at school isn't working for them.

It could make it easier for some families if they could keep their kids at home, where they can keep an eye on them. Some kids finds school a joke, and therefore they don't care about during any work or show up to classes. If the parents would be so lucky, that they could stay home and help the kid to do school work. That would be a great solution for some people that are having problems with their children getting into trouble at school.

There is other ways it could help kids to have online school. Lets say that it is a single parent with two kids, maybe the parent have to work a lot and is therefor not home a lot to drive the kids. There are no buses for the kids to go to school, so they miss school a lot of days. What if instead of putting stress on the parent and not having the kids go to school, they could just do their classes at home, and that way the parent could work, the kids could go to school and everyone would be happy.

But what if there is something else wrong? a mental problem, an injury or a disability that is forcing the person to stay home?

Well that is one way, you could use the online classes too. Let's say I am in high school, senior year, and I break my leg during a soccer game. I need an operation and Im supposed to lay still for 5 weeks, well i can't really miss school for that long. So i talk to my guidenscounsler and we figure out that I could actually still attend my classes and take care of my injury at the same time. By during the online school and not missing 5 weeks of senior year I could still get the credit i need to graduate.

But what if it is not an injury but I have a mental health problem or disability that is making it hard for me to go to school?

Now a days a lot of kids in school get bullied for having a mental health problem or a disability, and sometimes it gets to much for the kid, so their parents take them out of school.

Instead of giving up and just letting your kid sit at home and think they are not worth anything. You could enroll them in online school and that way they could still get an education and figure out what is out in the world for them.

But I do see that is not really the same as school, i see the point, that it would be lonely for some people to just do school at home and not really have the social life that school gives them. School make a lot of memories for people, for some people that is their time of their lives, they experience prom, go to homecoming, drive around, do fun things with their friends, have ups and downs and even figure out who they want to be as people in the world. So if you just took online classes all of your school years, you wouldn't have made those memories and had the opportunity to experience prom, homecoming or the fun by driving around with your friends singing your heart out to Justin Bieber or having a any of those ups and downs school sometimes gives you.

So should online school from home be allowed?

I believe that school from home should be allowed. It could help a lot of families that are having issues.

Why not help the people that need it, and it would help the country too, by giving them the space and time to get an education, more people can take a job and help out in the workplaces. Even if you are having a disability or a problem there should always be a space for anyone that wants to make a life for themselves.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D925E8553B9D,"I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This the modern way of studying in the majority of the world, so that can give more chance to all students who don't have time to be in school everyday. That would by very easy way for all special students who are disable or sick.

Every student has a different life from another, so at this time most students are working and studying at the same time. The online classes are benefit all students who dont have the time to be in school on time, work far of the schools' building, and has family. For example, in my school their are around thirty girls are marred , and have family or kid need to take care of. I knew some of them are using the online studying program with some classes, so they make their work way better than other who are missing their classes at lees once a week. in addition this would be helpful to all students planing to go to the College, For 60% of the College and University classes and exams should be taking online.

Also,the most benefit's people are the disable people. That will be the biggest gift in the life to have their education like every kid. They would study with other kids from home and share their life with them, so that will be so useful to make our kids, sister, and brothers are equal with other students and get the knowledge and skills from their schools' life. Moreover, that will take off a lot of expenses for the counties and families they spend on the private schools, so that is become a great benefit to the society. That will benefit all families, to keep their work, in staid of driving their kids for to long time twice in the day. Also, we the students are going to have the opportunity to make up the classes or take them from home, when we sick , late or have no way to be in school. I think this what will be the most common study way in the next ten year later.

Some ideas and people think that is not the right way to study or be educate, because they think most of student will use this to not be in school and being out of the school weather of teaching. With all my respect to all people and ideas rejected the online study' program, and in polite way, that online program for the kids who were not graduated from all schools level, from Elementary to High school, cannot take these online classes with out showing up their acceptable purpose and family agreement, so that how would schools be control the way of education for students.

These were some of to many benefits of the online studying and some of the good affection to the students' life and education. We should be use all the technology, that we have to make our life easier, but we need to control every device and plan the right way to our kids to use it with.

4C60FE6BE07C,"In this time of day there are a lot of different ways students can get their education. For most students education is a big part of their future and for others not so much. This means they will choose the best way that works for them. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it is not ideal.

The first main reason classes from home are not ideal is because they are less comprehensive. For some students to understand what is going on they need to be in the same class as the teacher. Being in the same class makes it easier for them to ask any questions they may have. But in this case of students being at home and not in the class, they are not getting hands on education or in other words proper education. This makes it harder for the students because then they have to go back and teach themselves and still may not understand. This also makes it harder for the teacher because if the whole class is caught up but one student then that would take time out of his/her lesson. Another reason is because students may have more work. When students get more work they get very stressed out at times and it makes it difficult for them to focus during video conferences.

The second main reason classes from home are not ideal is because a number of things could go wrong. Simple mistakes could be made during the lesson that the teacher didn't see. This could cause the students to make the same mistake during an assignment. Also, there could be some malfunctions during the video conference. An example of a malfunction happening is the video freezing during the lesson. A student's wifi could also stop working, which could cause them to disconnect from the rest of the class and lesson. Additionally, students could easily get distracted. While in a video conference they could get barged in on by a family member. Another example of a distraction is a loud background. This causes the student to not hear what's going on during the lesson.

Students can get a educational experience in many different ways. One way they can learn is by going to school and being in a classroom. Another way is by staying home and attending class from a computer. It is less beneficial for students to get their education from home because it is less comprehensive and anything could go wrong.            ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5B225CED16B5,"In recent weeks, news of new, life threatening viruses (such as the Corona virus) has gone up at a rapid rate, causing a large amount of disarray and discomfort within the educational system; between the staff members, the students, and the parents, it seems inevitable that schools will close to keep the students and the staff members as safe as possible. Once they understood the circumstances, parents and students started to have questions; ""how will the students continue getting their education?"", ""what format will it be in?"", and ""how will it be administered?"" The response that most school counties developed for these questions was long distance learning. Distance learning is a new format of teaching where students stay at their homes while completing assignments; but, this method of learning has gotten somewhat controversial. Many teachers argue that distance learning is not effective and that it allows for students to copy, cheat, or flat out be lazy. This is a true judgment, but misled; when distance learning is applied to hard working students, it allows for significantly better results more consecutively, making it way more effective than the current system set in place. The reason for its better performance is because of two aspects: number one, it allows for students to learn and practice taking initiative, and number two, its allows for students to learn to identify what their individual work process is, learn to adapt to it, and apply it to the real world.

The controversial part about distance learning is one of its fundamental aspects; the distance. The system of learning that was in actions for decades was based on a word to mouth learning process, where you had to be instructed in multiple different classrooms, on multiple different subjects, by multiple different instructors; it's quite tiresome, I must admit, but the degree of work is not the issue. The issue lies within the ""spoon fed"" mentality that develops in a work space such as this; a work space entirely devoid of any personal initiative. Never mind don't, when adolescents can't take the initiative for things that deeply benefits them, they will inevitably feel as if they are just a hamster running on a wheel, or just another gear in a clock, causing for a lot of procrastination or laziness; the stripping of self initiative develops a feeling of diminished importance in ones self leading to less attentiveness and over all less care for the subjects being learned. Quite frankly, the students that perform the best in school are the ones that are taught from an extracurricular source, whether its from their parents or someone else, about the importance of education, allowing that child to decide for themselves that they want to pursue it wholesomely i e. they took initiative to learn. With distance learning, students can be in the comfort of their own homes and decide for themselves when they feel best to engage in a new topic.

Regardless of what educational system is in place, whether traditional learning or distance learning, there will be the students that wont study, will copy their friend's homework, and will cheat on test, its unavoidable; this is still true for distance learning, and with common sense, the side effects of it can be determined quite easily. When given the option to to stay at home to complete school, in opposition to going to school to complete school, nine out of ten students would agree in an instant to stay home. When further asking them their reasoning, the responses your most likely to receive consists of this : ""Im going to go out and chill with my friends"", ""Im going to sleep in everyday"", ""im going to go out shopping"", or flat out ""Im not going to do any work."" The distance aspect of distance learning, when in the hands of people who initially didn't chose to go to school, will be full of procrastination and laziness. There can be measures applied to attempt to weed out the students that are straggling and try to help them develop better work habits, such as retake policies and extra help, but if a student doesn't care for what he or she is being told to work on, inevitably they will figure out a way around that work.

Work is of key importance to success; with out working, you can't attain a great majority of success. Evidently though, work comes in many different forms and styles, usually deriving from how that person had grown up and been raised; so, a work process that may come as natural to one person, may be foreign to another. Learning what a person's work process consists of is fundamental to attaining consecutively good results; distance learning allows for students to be able to distinctly figure out what schedules and work patterns works for them. While still in the traditional educational system, the process of work during that educational period is at the will of the instructor, if the instructor isnt going at a speed you can comfortably retain knowledge, then a lot of information that is being taught will not be remembered; when this process is repeated, it can lead to a development of stress or a numerous slew of issues.

In conclusion, if distance learning were to be put into action nationwide, the outcome would be very beneficial. Students that take initiative for themselves will become more prosperous and successful then the ones that don't; even then, the students that don't take the initiative are given the opportunity to learn how to and apply it to their lives. With the ability to stay at home, students can get the time to learn their work habits, adapt, and improve upon them so they can preform to the best of their ability, regardless of what they are tasked with. And yes, Although there are students who are not compelled to complete school, the amount will be greatly reduced because of the encouraging nature of distance learning, which allows for students to take their own initiative in learning something beneficial to them. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

The program of education for schools, had develop a way for the students to attend classes from home. Distance Learning , is a program that allows students from an specific region, that has approved this method to assits class by home. They required the students to have access to internet and a computer, because the assignment for the class will be provided in a file with instructions by the teacher in charge of it. I desagree with the distance learning program that would not benefit the students, becuase the better method for learning is seeing the person and oral explenation about the topic giving examples and interaction in the classroom.

First, the distance learning program, can create communication barries. As all the assignmemt are post it online, the student will be most of the time working and doing activities alone. Taking the program at home, he or she won't have the opportunity to demostrate the abillity to work as a team. In result, the issolation of communication can cause conflict in future jobs, as certain jobs assign to work with a partner to find a soluton or to interact with the different ideas that each one has.

Second, distraction in the learning process. Distraction can happen any time while the student is working in the class material. The computer is the essential tool for the work field, and an eassy method for distractions. As the computer have access to internet the student can open many windows at once as, video games, facebook, and many other social media apps with out being notice by the teacher making the learning process longer to complete. No having an educator that supervise his/hers process in work can lead the accumulation of work and the grade might decrease.

Lastly, distance learning program, can cause unscrupulous work. As the assignment are online, and the teacher can not monitor the correct procedure that the students are applying in their assignemts it can cause consecuences. The understament and knowledgemet can be questionable by the teacher, when the student is presenting a well knowledge in homework, but not in thes test of every unit. All this can result in an alegation by the teacher to the student in the way of he/she is not using the rule of plygiarism.

In conclusion, there is not benefit from the students in attending class from from home, becuase it is not productive for the students in certain ways. The correct process of doing class material, is not garanty to a hundred percent. the students can cheat and forget the use plagarize easely.

89C191C7957C,"What if you didn't have to drag yourself out of bed and haul yourself to school every morning? What if you could still learn, but stay in a comfortable space? With distance learning, both of these are possible. Distance learning is a way of online or video conferencing to attend classes. This method of teaching is beneficial because it allows for people who are disabled to participate in class and it allows for less money to be spent on school construction; although it is said that online classes make people more anti-social, it actually makes people more safe.

Traditional schools and classrooms do not accommodate those who are disabled; but, if classes were online, everyone would be able to participate. Many students have disabilities that prevent them from being able to walk and speak to their peers. If these students were to attend traditional schools, they would have difficulty navigating narrow, crowded hallways. They would not be able to participate in class or express their opinions. If classes were conducted online, however, these students would be able to stay in the comfort of their homes and type their thoughts out to have a productive conversation with others. They would not have to worry about getting to class physically, and could remain in a comfortable space while still communicating and learning. In addition to those with physical disabilities, online classrooms also help those with mental health issues. Many teenagers have social anxiety, and entering a classroom with a lot of people can bring panic and discomfort. If schools were online however, these teens would not have to experience discomfort in classrooms. They would be able to talk more freely and learn better if they had more control over their surroundings and their communication style. Students benefit from attending classes at home because those with physical disabilities are able to participate in class, and those with mental health limitations would feel more comfortable.

Online classes decrease the amount of money spent on constructing physical schools, resulting in decreased taxes and increased public utilities that students can benefit from. The funding for school construction comes directly from the taxpayer. If schools were conducted online, the cost of construction of a school would be completely eliminated, resulting in less money paid in taxes. This increase in net income for families could allow for students to have better access to resources such as test preparation and online subscriptions to textbooks. As families spend less money on the construction of the school, they are able to spend more on the education itself. In addition to more money dedicated solely to education, online classes also allow for better public amenities. Instead of reserving space for a physical school, state governments can instead construct utilities, such as libraries or gyms. This would give students more resources to use; in the long run, online schools could be a more effective use of space, resulting in more available resources for other utilities. Online schools allow for more spending on education rather than construction, and allow for public amenities that students can benefit from.

It can be argued that online school will result in students not having face to face conversations, therefore creating anti-social students. But, the lack of physical confrontation can actually be beneficial. Although it is less common today, bullying still occurs in schools. Students cannot escape their bullies in person if they have classes with them every day. But, with online classes, students are able to control who can speak to them simply by blocking people who are harmful. For example, a student who is being bullied in all their classes is less likely to learn due to stress and worry about how they will be treated; if this student were to take classes online, they could simply block their bully and stop worrying as much. Online school does not make anti-social students; instead, it creates a better environment for students to effectively communicate in and allows for less bullying. When people feel safe, they are more likely to speak to others and collaborate. Without the constant teasing that often comes with bullying, students will feel more comfortable to discuss their ideas freely. Online school would result in less bullying and therefore would prompt students to have more participation.

Online schools are beneficial to students as they increase participation in class and increase the amount of money spent on education rather than construction; they make students less susceptible by bullying, making students more comfortable and allowing for the flow of discussions easily. Overall, the benefits of online school outweigh the potential drawbacks.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

And make a teachers job a little bit easier. It could possibly solve issues that students have in schools. Distant learning can also help the students that dont like school. Being successful would be a lot easier, do to the fact more learning exercises would be put to use.

Working at home would be a good idea for the the people that dislike school. If a student is more comfortable at home, they would perform better on the work their doing. Some students get distracted easily and can't focus around a large amount of people. Being at home would eliminate some of the distractions that occur while at school. To do school work at home is a big responsibility. Although, high school student are mature enough to handle the responsibility of working at home. The students that think they would do a better job at home should be granted the opportunity to do so. If students feels they would do better learning a different way i dont see why they should be stopped.

It'll be less stressful for teachers as well. They would have smaller classes to teach. Which means they can be more available to the students in their classrooms. Teachers would be able to accomplish more if their class has a full understanding on whats being taught to them. Therefore they can teach a consistent pace that everybody comfortable with. There will also be more room to help the students that learn at a slower pace than others. Students could be more confident knowing they have help when needed when they feel like their struggling.

The students that get bullied and picked on may not want to go to school. If they feel as if school is not safe for them, that can mentally mess them up. Bullying is a big issue for schools in the United States. If the students that are getting bullied dont have to go to school, they would feel more safe. If those same students worked at home, they would feel safe and still receive an education. I would rather for my kids to do school work at home if they was constantly being bullied.

In conclusion, distant learning has it's ways of helping students. It would solve majority of the issues at school. It can boost the confidence in the people that dont like school. Options are expanded by introducing more ways to get you education. Having that in place could make more teenagers successful. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
24BA92F852DF,"Should students learn online or home?

I disagree I think that students should attend classes from school instead of home. A lot of times when you take classes at home you get distracted and you are not motivated to do your work. When you are in a working environment you are motivated and ready to learn and do work. For example I took an online class and I realized I did better in a classroom than online. It was so much stress for me, I say this because I did not get most of the material, I was not spacing out my time nor planning out my time.

The benefits of attending school is the interaction. You get to be around your peers and even new people that you might not know. With interaction we build up the courage to talk and be in certain situations like teamwork or having a new partner. It even helps us with the real world and knowing how to deal with people. When you are online you don't have the same interaction than you do in person, with online you don't really know or understand the person or get the feel of that person.

One of the harder things can be being not able to not understand what you are learning. With learning online you have a harder time processing what you are learning than in a classroom. Online is more speeding than really learning the material while going to a school you have a face to face person that can guide you and lead you on the right direction. Now with online you have a person talking and looking at you and it can sometimes be confusing and not beneficial. Yes, you could ask questions to your online teacher but it may confuse you more or still might not get it.

In conclusion I would recommended students to attend school than to do online school. There are more benefits going to a classroom than online. You have more of a hands on experience and more of a reality of the world. Also you can get to engage and have a better knowledge for yourself and experience different things. Being in school can help for are well-being and are personal growth, sometimes being in school we get put into certain things but it helps us as we get older and make us realize how to do things when we are in uncomfortable settings.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

FB07AD956C87,"Every student has dreamed about the idea of attending classes at home. Unconditionally, this very thought has already been emphasized ever since the invention of homework. Now, with the advancement in computers and technology, homework can be transformed into classwork that students can do throughout the day from the bed they sleep on. Many benefits are offered to both students and teachers when using online videos and conferencing for students at home. Almost every student has online access, encouraging sick and injured students to still do work at home without missing class time. Though a few problems exist with attending class from home, the benefits ultimately outweigh the negatives.

With current day technology, students have access to the internet almost everywhere they go. With the introduction of

Google's Chromebook more than 5 years ago ,

students are able to use their schools laptop for completing online work at their house. This encourages the idea that students don't need to have a phone or a home computer in order to complete work online. Even with no internet at home, students have the ability to go to the library to get free public WiFi. Thanks to another Google based website;

Google Classroom is a website where teachers can create private online classes where they upload classwork and other useful information students can view via an invitation code to the class. With a site like

Google Classroom, students have an extremely high chance of doing online work without much hassle, such as needing hard copies of the missed classwork and lessons. Theoretically speaking, hundreds of millions of students around the world already do this. This enchances the idea of ""Online Classwork"" instead of just ""Online homework, which many of us are already familiar with.

Additionally, the incredible online accessiblity grants students who are sick, injured, or missed school because of snow days, the option to do work online. When students are sick or injured, they are highly advised to stay at home. This brings up the still occuring problem of missing assignments and lessons. By offering online lessons and assignments, these students are able to complete their classwork without being behind and having F's put in for assignments, even with an excused absence. Furthermore, if school is cancelled because of snow or even the spreading of the Coronavirus, teachers have the ability to assign online work to their students. Teachers also have the ability to post videos of the lessons, which may help the students in need. With that added benefit, both students and teachers have less work to worry about. This introduces the idea of saving time. With the addition of online lessons and classwork, students and teachers are being granted the ability to not miss a certain unit or lesson, limiting many students from falling behind on classwork and other assignments.

However, there are a few negatives that come to play when it comes to online conferencing and classwork. As many adults are aware of by now, laziness is common amongst many teens. Students who don't feel like completing their online work will instead: play video games, hang out with friends, or do non-educational activities. While this is completely up to the student, online assignments can be brushed off and seen as useless if given many opportunities to fix that mistake. Along with laziness, students are more capable of cheating by looking up answers or asking friends whether or not they have completed certain online assignments. This limits students from learning and not taking classwork seriously, which possibly limits their potential of passing future tests. If a student does not understand an assignment they are doing even if their teacher uploaded a video of a lesson, the student will need to schedule a time to have a video conference with their teacher. This can be a problem due to the teacher being unavailable until a certain time, or unvailable the whole day.

Even with the few added negatives of attending online classes from home, students are offered the ability to keep their grades up by doing school work online at home. Teachers can also save their time chasing down a student for missing assignments as long as the student is able to complete their work online. In conclusion, attending classes from home is a great idea for students in need, as they get the opportunity to complete their assignments without hassle, stay on top of class lessons, and save both their and their teachers time.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D7D4F8C7FDFD,"Have you ever thought of taking classes online? Do you think you have good time management and could finish all of your assignments on time? Lastly, do you believe that students who attend online classes at home benefits them? Online classes have become more frequent over the years do due students being home schooled, don't have time during the day to go to school, or because they want to take extra classes; Whatever the reason may be, there are many students who attend online classes but is it benefiting them? I believe that students being able to attend online class won't benefit them because there are more cons than pros to this issue in a student's perspective.

One con is time management; it is a key factor, especially when taking online classes from home. This could be a problem for some students because taking online courses is nothing like taking them at school. The reason why I say that is because that I believe that in school there are teachers that make it their priority to keep students on task and make sure they finish their assignments on time. At home, there may not be someone there to encourage a student to do their school work or even finish it on time. Not having someone to help a student physically can cause the student to slack off. Even giving too many assignments in one day everyday can cause a student to become overwhelmed and not finish their work because of it. Some students have terrible time management skills and if they cannot find the time to put themselves on task, then they can end up failing school which can take a toll on their mental health.

Another reason why I believe online courses do not benefit students is because it can affect their social life. At school students are with each almost everyday, they talk, help each other, and experience all kinds of students with different cultural backgrounds. Meanwhile at home, a student is just on their laptop everyday by themselves. This can cause a student become distant with others, not wanting to leave their house, also not being open minded to other students with differences. It could even cause the student to become uncomfortable around others and become antisocial because they are so use to being by themselves.

Lack of resources in another problem. Some students cannot afford taking online classes; sometimes, students have to pay to take a certain course. They also may not have internet access at home or where ever they may be. Another one would be probably not having a laptop unless a school does provides one. Also, not having a teacher helping you right then and there. Usually, the most common way to communicate a school teacher is through emails. Teachers receive a huge amount of emails daily and some days, they cannot get to everyone and that can become a problem for students, they may become frustrated or stressed. Having lack of resources can make a student slack in school and have no motivation to finish it due to being stressed.

The pros of taking online classes I would say is being at home. A home makes a student comfortable, they don't have to wake up early, and they don't have stay at one place full of people for 6 hours. Another reason can be if a harmful virus spreads in the region the students live. Attending online classes while a crisis is going on in the outside world can be good because they won't become behind in school if they can manage their time wisely. It also benefits their safety and health. My third pro would be if a student needs to support their family or need to support themselves but also want to get their education, they can attend online classes that are flexible.

Even though this issue has its pros and cons. I still stand with my opinion that students that are able to attend online classes is not as beneficial as it should be. A student would need to be very dedicated and have good time management skills. Majority of these cons can affect a student's learning ability, social life, and most importantly, their mental health. For the potential problems of attedning online school, they need to be fixed and need effort from both, the school system and the students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
348227886FD6,"With the advancement in technology increasing, many once manual tasks have become digitized, and more and more places are beginning to incorporate technology into their surrounding. Schools have been impacted the most by this surge of technology, and many schools are taking advantage of it. The idea of distance learning has been introduced to some schools, and allows students to learn from home and take courses online via online or video conferencing. Many wonder if distance learning would be beneficial to students, and some even argue against it, claiming that learning should not depend on technology. Distance learning would be beneficial to students, because it allows for fewer distractions and creates a more personalized learning experience.

Firstly, being able to take classes at home provides less room for distraction. Often times, a classroom setting can be difficult to focus in, and many students are unable to complete assignments. Teachers spend a good portion of classes either trying to teach over the noise of students' conversations, or trying to calm the class down. While there are many students that want to hear what the teacher has to say, the sad truth is that there are also many who don't care. Some even go so far as to make unnecessary outbursts, or try to start conversations with individuals around them, without taking into consideration that they might want to learn. In the case of distance learning, students can learn from home, which means that they can learn in a peaceful environment, free of disruptions caused by obnoxious kids. Another example of distractions within the classroom is comfort level. Many students find that it is more difficult to perform in class if they are uncomfortable. Considering how many kids are usually in a school, it is understandable that many students are put in uncomfortable situations. For example, some teachers won't allow more than one student to go to the bathroom at a time. This creates an issue, because some people ask for a bathroom pass and never come back, which in turn means that no one else is allowed to use the restroom, even if they need to. The distraction of discomfort would not be as much of an issue in a home, because students are free to do what they need, to make themselves comfortable without many of the restrictions found in schools. Learning at home eliminates a majority of these distractions, and allows students to learn in an environment where they can focus easier.

In addition, the more personalized learning experience that comes with distance learning would allow students to be taught information more effectively. With distance learning, students can work at their own pace and focus on the areas that they are having trouble with. In class, sometimes students feel embarrassed to ask questions, or ask for help when they need it, because they don't want to seem 'dumb' to others. Learning online may make students more comfortable with asking for help, because they can do so in an environment free of judgment. On the other end of the spectrum, some children do exceptionally well in certain areas, so distance learning can allow them to move on to other areas, without having to wait for a teacher. In both cases, distance learning would be beneficial, because students could work at the pace most comfortable to them. Another aspect of personalized learning is a one-on-one setting. Many classrooms only have one teacher to teach a class with twenty or more students. This means that the teacher has to find a way to communicate that accommodates the most amount of people, and as an effect, a good portion of students do not fully understand the topic, and may not be able to get the teacher's attention in time to clarify. Taking classes online will enable students to make sure that they understand the topic, because they can clarify things that they are confused about, and have however much time that they need to process and retain the information.

In conclusion, many of the issues found in a traditional school environment are mostly, if not entirely, eliminated with distance learning. Students can learn within the comforts of their own homes, free of distraction, and can create the optimal learning environment for themselves. The flexibility of online courses will also allow students to work at their own pace and ensure that they understand the material, because they are free to put extra time in areas they need more help with and not have to allot equal time to all areas, even if they've mastered it. Distance learning would help students learn more efficiently and effectively and should be in place at every school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6C30C0076FAD,"""Knowledge is power,"" the esteemed Francis Bacon once said. Those words, repeated verbatim for ages, are the foundation of education, for as long as education serves to teach and inspire. However, there is an arising problem where students are unable to focus on their schooling due to external factors such as holding jobs or taking care of their families. This phenomenon causes harm to the future academic aspirations of these students and is wholly detrimental to their education. As per federal law, all children in the United States, from the ages of five to eighteen, are legally required to attend school. However, for those students who must serve a purpose other than studying, having to spend hours of their day at a physical school can actually severely affect their ability in both educational and non-educational pursuits. Although this situation may seem dire, there exists a surprisingly simple solution that can adequately meet all the needs of these students: distance learning. Distance learning is a program by which students are afforded the option of doing their coursework from home by taking online courses. By providing a feasible alternative to traditional schooling, distance learning will allow students to do better in all facets of their lives. Distance learning would be a massive benefit to students because it would allow schedule flexibility and encourage student independence, both culminating in a better future for all students.

While a work-life balance seems to be the cornerstone of happiness for any American worker, the same does not seem to be true for American students. In a 2016 study published by Psychology Today, it was found that the stress level of students had risen nearly 15% since 2012. This, in tandem with the fact that many high school students work part-time or even full-time jobs on the side is the exact reason why distance learning must be implemented: schedule flexibility. If students are able to shape their educational schedules to meet their unique independent needs, then the mental health of those students would doubtlessly improve. In fact, in a TED talk about a similar brand of tutelage entitled ""hack schooling"", it was discussed how the alternative method allowed for students to feel more secure about their learning as it was being done on their own terms. This means that if students are allowed the chance to shape their education to suit themselves, they are then able to comprehend the information that they learn rather than simply memorize and regurgitate it. By removing unnecessarily strenuous factors such as the long hours and rigidity of traditional schooling, distance learning provides an avenue by which students of all backgrounds and situations are afforded the opportunity to thrive.

Independence is a trait that empowers all those who possess it as it enables them to function on their own. Between fixed bell schedules and assigned bathroom breaks and a plethora of functional rigidity, independence is rather unfortunately not a trait that is bred well in traditional American schools. However, as students grow to become adults with much more autonomy than is allowed in said schools, this dependency can become malignant to the development of their own psyches. Giving students the ability to attend a distance learning program is something that can, in turn, teach students to become more independent and self-reliant. Between managing their own time, finishing their coursework, and learning to use their online resources wisely, students will gain a learning curve which will lead them to be vastly more independent than they would have been in a traditional school setting. Take, for example, students who complete online courses via the Generic_School program in the Generic_City school district. In the form to apply for courses, students are asked how they demonstrate independence and ability to manage their coursework. As distance learning demands more in terms of organization than traditional schooling does, it is clearly vital for students to be, or at least to learn to be, more independent. Essentially, by taking these courses, students will display an increase in independence and autonomy that they would not necessarily experience in a traditional setting. Clearly, in this regard, distance learning reigns superior.

Despite the many bonuses that distance learning offers, there is something that can be said about the social aspect of traditional public schooling. By forcing students to interact with one another, traditional schools facilitate social interactions between peers. While performing this function does seem to advantage traditional schools, it is not necessarily a bad thing for distance schooling. In fact, students are quite often put in social situations outside of a school setting. Whether interacting with family or speaking to friends, students experience social interaction rather often in their lives. Additionally, as many distance learning programs use video conferences as a means to teach, they can provide a means to teach further social and emotional interaction as well. Schools are not the only means by which students may develop social skills, and distance learning would genuinely not hinder any sort of societal interaction or ability that traditional schools seemingly provide.

In summation, schools should implement distance learning as it serves as a vital benefit to students who genuinely cannot gain from traditional forms of education. By allowing for flexible schedules, distance learning provides a feasible alternative to students who cannot perform their tasks within the confines of traditional schools. By encouraging independence, distance learning empowers students to learn discipline and organization in addition to traditional academia. Knowledge is indeed power, and with the knowledge that educators have about distance learning, they must now enable students to experience first hand how distance learning can benefit them.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
9D05C9239608,"I think students have benefits while they are attend thier clases in online because it helps them to learn more and to growth themselves.

Students will have more time to learn while, they are attendin their classes in home because they wil get enough time to study , to finish their homework or assignment because the have time that helps them to have to get good grade. For instance, I attended some clasese in online like; Computer Intro that helped me to hearn more about computer and helps to get some some information about how to write fast and the teacher gives me information about typing club that helps me to write quickly. Attending online classes gives alot of information like: how to research, what to look, and how to take notes it's helps to get more enough time to learn.

Also, it helps to save your time because many young teeneger works while they are in school. For-example, my friends start working while she is sixteen because she wants to save many to collage and to help herself. If, students taking online classes that helps to save their time because students who is working while in high school some students working after school and they going sleep late that distarcted to not give attension to the classes , but if students are taking online classes that would help to have time to review and it helps pay atttension well. It helps them to do well in skills by learning also it helps to by finiacal.

Aluthough, many of said taking online classes in home has disadantage because students get easly distarcted and can't improve themselves.

Students will get easy distarcted if, they are taking online or video while they are in home beacuse they can get ealy distarcted by social media like: Facebook, Indtagram or Snapchat because of most teeneger spend time to socia media that doesn't help them to do well in classes also, they can't get improve themselves because they can get alot of free time that doesn't help students to be succseful , however the teacher will give the students assignment, test, and homework while they attend the classes the teacher know how the students doing that helps the students to keep the track. Also, the teachers have the students parenting email when students first register that helps to keep students by paranting eyes. The teachers will send email to parents when they have test result , so parents will see how his/her children doing in the classes.

In summary, students can get good grades and they can improve knowledge while they are home taking by online classes.                                                                                                              ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
1129201DC11C,"Distance learning is a learning process that can be made online providing students with an alternative way to learn. Furthermore, you will be able to attend class from home or any place of your choosing outside of a classroom. Learning from home is a less productive way to learn, considering the different adjustments students have to make that can affect their grades.

Being lazy is a strong gesture for humans noticing the fact procrastination and long breaks take an action on laziness. Working from home creates laziness. For an example, you get an assignment on your laptop that involves handwork and time, your first instinct is, ""I will work on that later."" It defeats the purpose of working online where once you get an assignment, your main priority is to work on that assignment until it's finished. However, working in the classroom gets work done immediately when its due because it is a higher chance that it will get forgotten about or incomplete. Laziness could take control of grades if working from home became an option for all students.

Listening to a teacher online than in person can differ with learning skills, meaning it will be easier to day dream while trying to perceive information through a screen. For instance, if you're on a computer staring at a screen with no interaction with the teacher, your mind will wonder simply because there will be no activities involved nor discussion with classmates. Working with a teacher online is not he best option pertaining to bad learning skills and maintaining information.

Working with others brings in new ideas. In addition, you may learn off of other people and obtain information from classmates rather than from a teacher. However, learning online prevents interaction with classmates because there is no option for face to face conversation with classmates online. Different assignments like public speaking is a huge aspect when going to school. Say you have an interview for a job, you have to speak to the boss in order to get the job. Though, you have no experience, so it may be difficult to exchange conversation with one another. Whereas going to school you have speaking assignments to prepare you for public speaking anywhere including higher education like college. Interacting with people is important as school experiences relate and connects with real life situations

Some people argue, online schooling is beneficial because it excludes distraction from friends. However, distance learning can cause a decrease in grades and be a less productive way to learn. Think about how students lives will be different if their only experience of learning was through a computer, their mindset would be different knowing their responsibilities differ from someone that goes to school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
B5CBE846C3F7,"In this day and age, everything is always changing. New technologies and innovations bring about more efficient ways of completing tasks that were once tedious. One thing that hasn't changed in a long time, however, is the education system. Students commute to school, sit in class for eight hours, and then go home and do homework. Schools should offer fully online learning to students because learning at home would save time, and would allow students to learn at their own pace.

Most students take a bus to school, and for some, this trip is very time consuming. I, for example, live thirty minutes away from my school. This means that I spend five hours or more each week just traveling to and from school. Online learning would eliminate this issue, and would eliminate most of a school's transportation costs. Online learning would save students time because it can be done in the comfort of one's home.

Online classes are typically completed whenever the student wants to, so online learning would work for learners of all speeds. For some students, sitting in class for eight hours straight with little time between classes is grueling, and yet others have no trouble focusing for the whole day. Online learning could let learn at their own pace, wether it be taking breaks throughout the day, or completing all of their work in one sitting. Online learning would also prevent the spread of certain diseases, because students are no longer crouded in the same building together.

While some may argue that online learning takes away the one-on-one time between students and teachers that is necessary for learning, there is an easy solution to this. If online learning is proposed in schools, students should be able to request video conferences with their teachers if they require additional instruction. If classes are held live online with all of the students instead of done at the students pace, the students could ""raise their hand"" by clicking something on their screen that makes something pop up on the teacher's screen, and the teacher would then call on them.

Overall, online learning would be very beneficial for students and teachers because it gets rid of commuting time and, in some cases, lets students learn at their own pace. New technologies are made to improve efficiency, and we need to use them to their fullest. The ability to communicate with people from long distanced through calls has existed for decades, and it is about time we use this technology in our school system.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4212518DAD4F,"In recent years, many schools have begun to offer programs for online learning through video lectures and online assignments.

Many colleges provide this as an option for students enrolled at their schools.

Although it hasn't been as widespread among elementary, middle, and high schools, school boards have started to discuss this option due to the coronavirus outbreak.

This option allows teachers to continue instruction while not having direct contact with the students and hopefully limiting the spread of the virus.

This method also reduces the security risk of schools where there is the possibility of a fire, natural disaster, or active shooter.

In some cases, this method of learning can be beneficial for students, but overall distance learning is not an appropriate substitute for in class learning.

One reason that distance learning isn't as effective is the lack of control that it offers.

In online courses, many students are able to cheat on tests, quizzes, and other assignments.

Without a teacher their to monitor them, there is no way to verify that students are acting honorably.

This can lead to problems, especially if students make a habit of recieving unauthorized aid on assignments.

When students make that a habit, they do not always learn the skills that the assignment is testing them on.

Additionally, it instills a belief that they do not have to work hard to do their work.

Without a better way to monitor cheating, distance learning can not be as effective as in class learning.

Another issue with distance learning is the inability to do hands on assignments.

Many courses such as Physical Education, Chemistry, Biology, and other science courses require hands on assignments like labs.

Distance learning eliminates the ability of students to complete these assignments that are key elements of these courses.

Even with courses that do not require such assignments, some students learn and retain knowledge better when they have hands on assignments.

Without hands on learning, these students may not achieve the same level of understanding that they would through in class learning.

Distance learning limits the ability of students and teachers to perform hands on assignments which can be deterimental to certain courses and students.

Distance learning can also be expensive as it requires students to have a computer or electronic device and a stable internet connection.

This is not a problem for many students, but for some this is very difficult.

This system puts poorer students who may not have the best technology at a disadvantage.

In order to avoid this inequality, schools would have to find a way to ensure that all students would recieve the same educational experience.

This would mean spending even more money to provide students with internet and electronic devices, as well as any additional materials that they might need.

Distance learning could be helpful as a short-term alternative if students are unable to come to school because of something like sickness or snow.

This system would allow them to continue learning even if they are unable to be physically present at school.

While this option is appealing, it would not work well as a long-term system because of it could cause inequality among students of different financial situations, it lacks oversight that could prevent cheating, and it can cause students to lose certain educational opportunities that can be crucial to their understanding of certain topics.          ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4D4683449914,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But the good option for students is to attend at school because if they take the option to attend school online classes at home. students will not benefit from online classes, students will just spent time on video games, and students will not be successful.

The first reason is that students will not benefit from online classes because it is not the same when they attend at school. Student can learn more there, in other words students pay attention to teachers. For example, in my case I can not learn more in online classes at my home because when I open the computer to do the class work or activities, I just get stress and I do not focus on them because there is no teacher who can tell me to pay attention. And because it is not the same when I am attend at school classes. In school I learn more things because when I do not understand something I ask for help to my teachers. I can say that I benefit more there than attending to school online classes at my home and also students can get more benefit by attending at school.

The second reason is that students will just spend time on video games instead of doing their class work or activities of school online class. For example, when I open my computer the first thing I like to do: is watch video games, play games, or watch movies like Disney. For these reasons I spent a lot of my time there, it is something difficult to me to focus on the online classes. Do online classes is hard for students because there are things that can distract students and they will not focus to learn or to the activities. They will just spend time on other things, as a result they will not be prepared for the next level of learning. Attending to school is something different because school has rules for students and teachers who can teach us personally, there is no excuse to learn, and there is no thing that can distract us from class work because teachers will be there watching us if we do our class work or activities.

Additionally, some people says that students will be more success by attending school online classes because they think technology has more advances in the word and that can help students to find answers to respond the questions and they can learn more. However they are incorrect, because in this case they considerate students less intelligent. Students can be successful by attending at school and not by attending online classes at home. As a students we can learn more at school classes, our teacher will always advise us to study to get a great grade and also they advise us to read books because there are lessons that can teach us: about life, about failure, and about success and that make students more smart. On that way we will progress on our life to achieve our goals.

In conclusion, it is better to attend at school because students will be prepared for the exterior world. If students attend to school online classes at home they will not have the desire to learn or to study. They can think "" there is no teacher who can tell us to do our class work so we can go outside with our friend.""

It is the sad reality and I am the first one who ca do the same. That the reasons that students can not benefit from online classes, students will just spend time on video games, and they will not be successful. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
CAC42EC32F44,"Have you ever forgotten to do your homework because of distractions at home? These same distractions apply to online classes. If students attended classes online, it would not be beneficial because it is difficult to focus, it is difficult to afford, and it will make you dependent.

Taking classes at home is very distracting. Everybody has distractions at home, whether it is electronics, family or your pets. Electronics are distracting to students in many ways, for instance: your phone is a great example because it can be used to communicate with anybody. It can also be used as a gaming device which can be pretty addicting to some people. Family is distracting to students also. Many students in high school have a younger sibling who can be very distracting because they require so much attention. Some students may have a bad relationship with their family. This can lead to stress and anxiety which will make it hard to work at home. Pets can be distracting for example: if you are a student taking an online course and your dog needs to be walked, this will take away valuable learning time that you most likely paid for. This leads to my next topic which is money.

Students who are less fortunate can not attend these classes. Online courses usually cost money to maintain. These courses can be very expensive and students who are less fortunate would not be able to afford to take a class. Students should not have to sacrifice their own education due to low income. Schools can provide students with laptops but they can not provide students with internet. Although it may be easier to work on a computer, many students can not afford them. Laptops can be easy to lose or to have stolen and are very expensive to replace. Schools should keep teaching on paper because it is affordable.

It will make you dependent on electronics in the future. Students who grow up using a computer their whole life to learn will become dependent on it. A computer can teach you many things and can also do your work for you, but the best way to learn is to have a hands-on experience. The easiest way to figure out something you do not know is to search it up on Google. This will make learning much harder because you have a computer that can give the answers to you. Nothing teaches you better than your mistakes and you will not see advancement if you have something doing your work for you. These online courses take away the opportunity to work with others in person.

Schools should not introduce online courses because they can be distracting, expensive and dependent. As a student who has grown up in poverty I find online courses harmful to society. Schools should definitely use computers in school, but not out of school. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1016199DA6FD,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option from home by way of online or video conferencing. Allowing students to have an alternative option to distance learning is beneficial in many ways. Not only does it allow students to learn in a familiar friendly environment, it also allows them to form and adjust to their own schedule, and develop better sleeping habits and a healthy lifestyle.

Offering distance learning as an option for students allows them to learn in a familiar, safe, and amble environment. This can benefit students with issues in mental or physical health. It can also benefit students who want to experience learning outside of a traditional classroom. For example, Generic_Name, a third year high school student, has gone to public school for the majority of her school life. She has decided to take classes online at home for one year just to gain the experience. At home, Generic_Name feels like she is able to learn better because she is familiar with the atmosphere. Occasionally, she is able to go for a walk during her break which is something she wasn't able to do when she was in a regular classroom. Having her parents during the day, enables her to ask questions, discuss assignments, and other things they might want to discuss that day. Giving students an out of classroom learning experience allows them to gain better insight on the world around them, and gives solace and understanding of their atmosphere and surroundings. Similarly, Generic_Name is a fifth grader in primary school. His parents decided to enroll him in a video conferencing class with a one-on-one teacher. Generic_Name suffers from ADHD which limits his performance in the classroom because of his short attention span. Having a one-one one teacher allows Generic_Name to feel safe in his own home which can help prevent distractions and outside noise often produced in a noisy classroom. Students deserve to feel safe in any learning environment they choose to be in. Giving students the opportunity to learn at home can give them a sense of security and assurance.

Distance learning can also benefit students by giving them the opportunity to adjust to their own schedule. Students are occupied with numerous things outside assignments and tests. Allowing students to form their own schedule allows them to have time for sports, extracurricular activities, and self-care. For example, Generic_Name is a high school student who is involved with the band, debate team, and track. Normal school hours often tire her out because of the fast-paced, non-stop hustle. She decides to take online classes so that she can alleviate some stress. Her online classes allow her to have time for her assignments, while also giving her spare time to practice basketball and attend her extracurricular activities. Similarly, Generic_Name is a middle school student who is involved with a lot of activities outside of school. For one semester, she decides to take video conference classes that would last for about an hour three times a day during the school week. She is able to schedule her events around the time she needs to appear for classes. Students are taught responsibility and good time-management skills when they are giving the ability to form and adjust their own schedule.

Finally, another reason why distance learning can benefit students is it helps students develop a better lifestyle. Many students suffer from sleep deprivation and other health issues as a result of overworking and vigorous classroom expectations. Although working online doesn't deplete the consequences of overworking and challenging assignments, it gives students the ability to take breaks which can resolve burn-out and mental stress. Generic_Name, a high school freshmen, is involved with basketball and hockey. He often comes home late at night after practice and games. When he arrives, he is flustered with the amount of homework and studying he still needs to complete. Often, he finds himself getting a minimum of four hours of sleep before he needs to wake up and go to school. Giving him the ability to take classes from home allows him to develop a sleep schedule and finish assignments on time without the stress of worrying about his other activities. In addition, Generic_Name is also a a high school student who is involved with the music program at her school. She often finds herself coming home late after rehearsals and barely has the time to complete her studying and assignments. She's anxious and stressed about her school work which slowly begins damaging her performance in school and her mental health. If Generic_Name decides to take online courses as an alternative, she will be able to fit in school work around her schedule and also maintain her time for her music program. For some students, learning at home can benefit them by altering their sleep habits, and improving their overall lifestyle and well being.

While some may argue that distance learning by way of online or video conferencing doesn't benefit students, there are ways that it can help students improve their lifestyle and performance in their academics. Giving students the ability to attend school online can be beneficial to people with medical conditions that prohibit them from functioning in a regular classroom environment, can improve sense of responsibility, and can give students the ability to develop better liiving habits that can improve their overall well being. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
672D0F5241A4,"The traditional school setting is a busy building with many classrooms full of students, but whether or not that is the ideal school setting depends on the student. For a student to reach their full potential, he/she need their ideal classroom setting. For some, that is the traditional public school setting. However, for some others, classes taken in the comfort of home is best. Now with brand new technology, students are able to take classes at home and many have taken advantage of this opportunity. Public schooling, however, remains the dominant setting of education. Despite this, taking online classes at home can provide significant benefits such as providing an escape from distractions, allowing introverts to reach their full potential, and a more flexible schedule.

The home offers students the opportunity to learn far away from the distractions present in a public school. Classrooms in public schools can become very distracting due to talking or being near friends. This can seriously hamper some students' abilities to concentrate and take in information. A home setting, so long as there is a quiet place in at least one area of the house, completely eliminates this distraction and allows students to listen clearly to their teacher. Public schools, along with having distractions,are also a place where gossip can spread like wildfire and there is nothing anyone can do to prevent it. Particularly interesting gossip can leak into a classroom and not just disable a single student but the entire classroom and prevent all the students from being able to concentrate. Not only that, but gossip can also be a form of bullying, which not only distracts the victim but may severely damage their mental or emotional health. No gossip can have such an impact on a family, allowing the student to get all work done in peace. Home is often seen as a place to go for peace and tranquility, and that is what makes it an excellent learning setting for some students.

Being alone at home away from others can be a huge benefit for those who are introverted. Introverts do best when they are alone and being around many other people can have a significant effect on some of them. Introverts often have just as much potential as everyone else, if not more, but they would be unable to shine in a packed classroom. Classes from home might just be what introverts are looking for since they can truly do their best due to the lack of strangers around. The public school setting can induce high feelings of dread or anxiety in introverts due to the aforementioned reasons. Though students shouldn't necessarily have to be happy about school, no student should experience daily feelings of dread or anxiety because if these feelings persist long enough, a massive stress buildup can harm mental health. A home setting ensures that those who choose it feel comfortable and can wake up in the morning feeling ready for school. A home classroom setting can ensure that introverts both reach their full potential and stay mentally healthy.

Students who opt for home classrooms can afford to be much more flexible in their daily routines and make room for more errands or activities. The public school setting shows little to no concern towards the daily routines of their students, and students must change their schedule to accommodate school. Online courses, on the other hand, allow students to go at their own pace on the content and makes working ahead much easier. Students with tight schedules will find that they can easily work online schooling into their schedule. The ability of online schooling to allow students to choose when to learn rewards efficient students or motivated students with more free time on their hands. Online schooling understands the importance of time management and by rewarding those who work ahead of time, the behavior of working ahead is encouraged as it should be. Those who get their work done early in public schools are not rewarded as much since there isn't much to do other than sit in the classroom, and so the habit of working ahead is less prevalent. Online schooling not only allows students to go at their own pace but also rewards those who move at a fast pace.

Although public schools are still much more accepted, Online schooling has proved its success by minimizing distraction, providing benefits for introverts, and allowing for more flexibility in day to day life. The noisy, gossip filled classrooms in public schools no longer have to be where a student gets his or her education. Instead, it can be in the peace of their room. Introverts no longer must be suppressed by the strangers surrounding them and can really give it their all when alone at home. The ability of students to pace themselves on online courses means that students who are very busy with sports or activities can now make time for everything. Without the option of schooling from home, there are many students who would suffer from increased stress due to distractions, being around others, or just not having enough time for everything. For those students, home is the ideal educational setting for them. What the world would be like if everyone had their ideal educational setting is up to imagination, but it is safe to assume that it would be more advanced than the world today.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
B0F3FA7DE6CE,"Students hate the fact they have to get up for school. Some students can get work done better if it was more quiet. They wouldn't be as stressed out from all the work they get they can go at there own pace. They would also be more dedicated to do there work. Students should take classes at home because they can be more comfortable at home and there would be less distractions.

When students take classes at home they can feel more comfortable. Students don't have to worry about getting up so early in the morning to come to school when they get up at a good time they had enough rest to be focused enough to do there work. Online classes can actually be better for the students because they move at there own pace even though there teacher might give them a do date but they wouldn't be as rushed as they would be in a public school. The students also can be more organized and keep up with there work better. However,being at home can take stress off the students because they don't have to worry about rushing to class or getting involved in situations that they should't be in. Some students concentrate more when they listen to music while they are doing there work,they can do whatever makes them feel more focused because they are at home. Video conferencing can help the student more because they are getting the teachers full attention and can get more help.

Online classes can make learning easier for the students because there would be less distractions around them. Being in a classroom full of other students can be difficult at times because of noises,constant talking,and bad influences,but being at home can be a little better because they can move away from the distractions. Students tend to get side track and the mind focuses on something else thats not important. They can get there work done more because they wouldn't be as talkative with other that will throw them off track. Consequently,students actions effect everything if they be around people that are bad influences they are going to fall into peer pressure and that can effect the students grades and schooling. Being at home taking classes can be less peer pressure for them that means better grades.

Finally,students taking online classes can be good for there mental health. The less distractions they get the more they will succeed. Being uncomfortable can be a bad thing for the student because there grades will fall and they wouldn't be as focused as they need to be. When at home they can find a place they can relax and get there work done. Less stress will be on them the more organize they will be no more crumbled up work in the locker or book bags because everything would be organized for them online. So students should take online class for the better of there grades and for there selves.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students.

People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids don't learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids.

Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why

I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it .

Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition.

First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. That's why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable.

Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. That's why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too.

Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and it's hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them that's why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless.

in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it.

When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isn't going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the don't listen to the rest of the people.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1649A2246587,"Benefits of being home school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility.

One of the reason why home school it's good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies.

Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program.

I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life it's really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, it's the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family.

In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important it's to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home. This is going to bring a big change in our community and more professional, responsible people. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
CE2EC298670A,"I think that it a good that some schools offer distance learning for the students because some of them can't go to the regular schools and some of them are not able to finished one school and the distance learning offer a good idea for them. and is a very good experience. If can be a good apportunity for does who can't fiinish the school for example

Some of the students have kids and have to take care of them.

Another reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self.

Also the family of the students can not affords the students education.

The person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job.

I think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up.

First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes.

Next another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesn't have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education.

Also another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. And with that they prepare for the future.

The last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now they're trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids. Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that want to overcome. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families. With that the people who is trying to finished the school can be prepare to have better opportunities of work. And also finished the school he or she can get a better job and be able to be with their kids. And don't leave their kids with another person many time. And spend more time with them.

In conclusion the distance learning education is a very good idea in my opinion. because the people that can not go to school because they have kids or the teenager that have a pregnancy when they were on the school. That give opportunity for the people with low income. The people that can afford their school. And also the people that does not have their family in this country. The people who work and study and does not have the time to go to a regular school. Classes in online is good for does that need to finish the school. For does that when they were in the school have some problems. Also is a good benefit for those that there time is not long as they want. The people of the distance learning have good opportunity for their future. And can be productive for the people who does not have a work because they did not finish the school. because have an education is important for this country and for all the people that want a good life and better opportunities of work. Finally the distance education is a good ideas because help people with the things they want and that they need too.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
74F07823BCB9,"I beleive that students will benefit in many ways from more schools offering distance learning as an option to attand class from home. It gives students, at home sick, the opportunity to keep up with the pace of the class, instead of missing a day. Many schools are currently integrating technology into learning wherever possible, with adding this option other perks come with it such as extra help from teachers after hours and the ability to partake in discussion. Distance learning also benefits students that may suffer from social anxiety or bullying, they would now have the option to learn from a very comfortable and familiar environment. Distance learning increases the opportunities students have to learn and improve upon their knowledge.

When students miss school due to illness, they miss out on the lessons taught that day and are put in a position where their education is rushed and this affects how well the content is learned. However, with distance learning students who are out sick can still learn what they need for the day, and participate in class as normal. Some students who are very dedicated to their learning, may go to school when they are sick so they wont miss out on anything important. This can be dangerous to the health and well being of their classmates. With the introduction of distance learning, the sick student's classmates are safe and the student can continue with their education.

Many schools recently have prioritized integrating technology in the classroom wherever possible, and have seen the benefits from doing so. Distance learning is yet another beneficial example of technology integration in the classroom. Without distance learning as an option students who miss a day have to catch up with the rest of the class by either talking to their teacher individually or getting the materials beforehand for planned absences. This puts extra stress on the students as well as the teachers who have to spend time worrying about individual students. With distance learning, however, teachers can spend more time focusing on the class as a whole and the standards of learning for all of their students.

Students who suffer from social anxiety, or are bullied in school may also benefit from distance learning. Social anxiety may hinder a students ability to learn, especially in loud and very social settings like the classroom. being able to attend class from home would allow these students to learn in comfortable and familiar environments with less distraction form the learning that needs to be done. When students are bullied, often times they see school and the classroom as a dangerous place to be, and may spend their time there worried about being picked on, instead of focusing on learning. distance learning allows them to learn from the safety of their own home where they can focus on the lessons.

Distance gives students more opportunities to learn from home where they can feel comfortable and safe. Students that miss school days due to health issues or any other reason can stay up to pace on the topics covered in class. When school becomes unbearable to same students they have the option to learn from home if it will improve the quality of their education. With distance learning, teachers can teach more affectively and efficiently.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
088CB85E5B7A,"Often time, students will have to stay home from school for various reasons. This can cause them to get behind in their classes. They may get sick and not be able to go to school for one or more days; or, they may not have a way to get to school. Beacuse of staying home, students miss out on lessons and fall behind. If classes were available online this would not be an issue. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because there would be no sick days, they can work at their own pace, and there would be no wasted time.

Online classes would eliminate sick days almost entirely. Most of the time, the only reason students have to stay home from school is to prevent spreading the sickness they obtained. They would be able to safely get work done without having to leave his or her home. Other times, students stay home simply because they couldn't find a way to get to school. It would benefit them greatly if they could acess their classes online, in case they can't physically attend those classes. So, they would not have to miss out on lessons or fall behind.

Another reason students would benefit from attending classes online is that they would be able to work at their own pace. Frequently, students will feel overwhelmed in a classroom because the teacher or professor is teaching at a fast pace. Also, at home, they would be able to go to the restroom, get a drink of water, or something to eat while in a classroom they would not usually be able to do so. In addition, students would be able to listen to music while they work. Silence in a classroom can cause someone to get distracted more easily than they would listening to music.

Lastly, students would benefit from online classes because there is no wasted time. In school, a lot of time is wasted because of study hall or exploratory classes that are not needed. Time can even be wasted in core classes due to finishing work early and having nothing else to do. If a student were to work at home, time could be managed better for them personally. For example, a student could spend more time working on math than history, instead of spending the same amount of time on both. They could also do their work out of order to get assignments they see more important done first. This way, they would not have to wait around for the teacher to give the next assignment or wait for their next class to begin. Although, it is true some students may waste more time at home due to all the distrations, it would still be more benefical to take classes online because the students who waste time at home are the same students who waste time at school.

In conclusion, students would benefit from classes being available online. They would not miss out on anything from staying home and they could work at their own pace. Also, they would not be wasting valulable time. Every year, many students start getting bad grades due to missing new lessons or reviews. Attending classes at home would decrease the amount of students falling behind. Overall, making classes available online would be a very smart decision.         ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
6C83EED20357,"Online Education can Lead to Success!

Some students have trouble focusing, interacting with others, and/or have distance problems from attending physical schools. Our communities and government have found a way for students to be able to attend classes from home. I believe online education can be beneficial for many students that have problems attending their local schools. Online education can help students concentrate and attain better knowledge than in a classroom.

When students start online education from home, they dont have to worry about their peers distracting them. In other words, they are able to complete all tasks that have been assigned because they're focusing on their education without disruptions. This shows some of the obstacles that are overcame when taking online classes, rather than going to school. In addition, when I was younger, I was able to complete all my homework and assignments from home. I was able to concentrate better at home without having any unwanted noises and my peers trying to distract me. Further more, my friend Generic_Name, who now takes online classes from home, told me that her grades increased because she has someone teach her individually, rather than having a teacher teaching 25 students. Online education can help students in need of extra help and for those who can't complete assignments at school.

Secondly, online classes can help students gain a better understanding and knowledge on what is being taught to them. When students are in a comfortable environment, they seem to pay better attention to what is being taught. This can lead to our communities having brighter generations that could improve our technologies, medicines, and our world in general. For example, online education has a variety of classes offered that some schools don't have. With more classes offered to students, they are able to master professions in their early lives. This will lead to smarter generations in the near future. Another example to add to this reason is that students accomplish more from home, and I can prove this from previous personal experience. During my sophomore year of high school I was able to complete most of my school assignments from home; furthermore, I felt comfortable with completing assignments at my own pace. This shows how completing assignments online and out of school can still lead us to success.

Many may believe that online school doesn't teach students what is required. I understand why some might think this because students who learn from home usually have a lot of free time. These students manage to have a lot of free time because they're able to achieve more things in a shorter amount of time. This is due to the fact that people achieve things faster without distractions. Online classes offer more free time when students finish the required assignments quicker than in a classroom. An example to prove that online school does teach a lot comes from my cousin's personal experience. She was able to have a kid and take online classes from Generic_School. After she graduated with online classes, she managed to get a well paying job. Humans always find ways around obstacles to achieve greatness. Online school is one way to achieve success.

In conclusion, online education is a great way for students to graduate from school without attending physical schools. With personal experience and experience from people around me, online classes have helped us get to the next level of education. Online classes at home help students concentrate better and gain more knowledge on what is taught to them. Is online school a great step for you?",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
98D257987FDE,"To the non-morning students, don't you hate having to be awoken so early every morning only to have to get dressed and ready to go to a place where students dread of going, school? Well, you are in luck because there are classes where you do not have to go through all that trouble and just take your time waking up. The alternative to going to school is online classes are classes, classes that you can take online and from anywhere at all. One no longer has to go to the trouble of waking up early and panicking about what to where for the day and just relax at home in their pajamas. Taking online classes will benefit students who want to take the classes by giving them more freedom to decide their own time tables or day schedules and be able to work at their own productive speeds.

Online classes are different from normal classes where you sit in a classroom all day. Students can take these classes at home or out anywhere they feel comfortable working. Classes are usually one-on-one with just you and the instructor of the class, so it is a bit lonely for those who like to work in groups with other people, but is perfect for students who prefer to work alone and do not like to work with they noisy sounds of other people. There are no more distractions from other noisy students trying to disrupt the class anymore, and this will allow you to work more efficiently. Having no distractions and a good working environment helps with a the student's working condition and let's them work faster then if they have peers talking and distracting them getting less work done.

Benefits of not having to go to a school are not having up so early in the morning. Students can choose whenever they want to start their class in the day or during the evening. There is more freedom in getting to choose your class schedules and it let's you build in your own free time when the student needs to because only yourself knows when a break is need for yourself. Other upsides to not having to go to a school is not having to carry those heavy backpacks with bulky binders everywhere. Online class teachers can not give you physical handouts to hold, unless you print them out yourself, so there is no need for binders and all that trouble. The online classes have more writing assignments and less projects than in school, so if you do not like writing then the online classes maybe aren't the best mach for you.

Working in online classes is a more productive and beneficial class for student who prefer working alone and working from home. The classes aren't for everyone, but there definitely are those who would benefit more from taking these online classes to taking normal school classes and would also want to take these classes more. Being able to choose and control your schedule and work from home lets students work at their own speeds and better benefit their growth in learning. Online classes should definitely be in a student's choices when deciding new classes.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
91377BE7D4ED,"Imagine if you could do school from home and have time to relax or do more stuff. I would love to be studying from my house because I would never have any distractions, and I can just stay comfortable the whole time. People say online school is better than online school, but online school is more comfortable and nicer for students because they don't have to get dressed and ready just for school, they can take their time with the school work, and they have more time to do more stuff like get a job or play a sport.

A lot of students get stressed in the morning because they don't know what to wear for school. What if they didn't have to worry about that anymore? I don't like to get up just to dress and get ready for school. Online school, the type of school that students don't have to worry about what you wear or how people think of you because no one will ever see you. We all get lazy at some point in life, and we just want somethinh that will make us feel comfortable while studying.

All students get rushed because they have too much work to do, and sometimes, they don't do it on time because it's too stressful for them to finish it all. Online school gives you a long time to finish all your work and maybe a little extra time to relax. My friends and I are always stressed because of how much school work we have to do, but if we could do online school, it would all be so easy and less stressful. Online school is the best way to get time for all your work.

Everyone that goes to a school knows how hard it is to keep up with the work and what they do outside of school. Maybe it's a sport or a job or it could be both. It would be great if we all had that extra time to do all that without stressing. I rarely have time for school and work , but my friend, Generic_Name, does online school, and she has all time she needs to finish her school work, go to her job, and play lacrosse.

Some might say that going to a normal school is the best way to study; however, online school is a better and safer for students because they are able to take their time with the school work. they don't need to get up and stress themselves about what they should wear or how they look, and they have more time for other stuffthat aren't related to school like sports or jobs. How nice would it be if we didn't have to worry about any of these problems? Online school will have you relaxed most of the time.             ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F23D76828AF1,"Some schools are trying to offer distance learning as an option for students, that means that students have the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students find it less stressful, students get their work done on time and students have more time to do extracurricular activities outside or inside of school.

The majority of students find it less stressful to attend classes from home, for example: Around the schools people talk about how great would it be to take classes online instead of going to school because they have a job and attending classes online is the best choice for them since the majority of students don't have time to go to school because of their jobs, another example is that students overthink about the classes that are taking in school, which classes are going next and that stresses them out, but if they take classes online they would not stress too much about since online is easy for students. The last example is that the majority of students have anxiety for seeing a lot of people, that stresses them out too, when they go to school there is a lot of students, they are loud and push each other, the schools are overpopulated, and that gives students anxiety and it is much better to take classes online then go to school.

Students get their work done on time if they choose to attend classes online. For example: At my school, Generic_School, students try to do their work but other students instead of working they don't because they are playing around with their friends, sleep in class and even worse, they horseplay in class and that distracts the people that are doing their work or trying to finish it during or in class and that is disturbing for them so that makes them want to attend classes online from home and get their work done on time then going to school and distract themselves and not get their work done on time and get bad grades becuase of the distraction they have in school.

Students have more time for activities if they attend classes from home by way of online. For example: My friends do sports and clubs, but school makes them have less time for them to attend because of the amount of work that the school gives, but they heard that in online it is not like that because they can work easely in the computer instead of writing in a piece of paper like schools do all the time and that makes them have more time to do extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, taking classes online from home is the best choice for students. If they prefer this option, it would benefit them because they find it less stressful, they get their work done on time and they have more time to do extracurricular activities outside or inside school. Students should choose this option because it brings them many positive reasons and with this option they can achieve their goal and have fun at the same time, this choice is not going to waste their time at all.     ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6292FA7E5BD1,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe that is a good option, and students would benefit being able to attend classes from home .Many teenager can have good benefits from taking classes from home. Today many students can not assist to the school because the transportation,or they have appointment that they have to assist.

First, I think that is good option for students to attend classes from home, because some students do not have transportation .For example, i have a friend that she can not study because her way to the school is very long and she do not have transportation and she do not have someone who came take her to the school because her family do not have a car .If she could have the opportunity to have class from home will be a good benefit for her,because she would like to finish her high school.

Also, many student miss classes because they have to work ,or they have appointments and they can not assist to their classes. When students miss classes ,they will be affected latter for their test or quiz .For example, last week i did not went to the school because i have a doctor appointment ,and when i went the next day i was affected because i took a quiz and i did not recover the class that i missed .But if students could take classes online the day that they can not assist to the school will be good because they will be not affected because they will have the opportunity to recover the class.

In conclusion, offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home online or video conference is a good option,because it will give a lot of benefits to many students who can no attend schools. It will be more easy to students who can not assist to their classes and they will no be affected on their grades,because students who miss one day can be affected a lot on their grades.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
2CCFB8C0BAF7,"Would students learn more at home rather than at school? This is a highly debated question in the educational world as many schools are considering adopting ""distance learning"" for their students. Some students who are sick or injured may benefit from a home environment. However, the majority would struggle due to distractions, distance between student and teacher, and the lack of an authoritative figure to keep them on task.

Many students are easily distracted in school, so in a room full of things much more interesting than classwork, there is an even greater chance for distraction. Along with this, for those students who's parents work outside of the home, there is no one to help keep them on task. That is a lot to ask for a young adolescent with distractions such as video games, pets, etc. Throughout the development of my education, I have discovered staying focused and on track to be one of the most difficult things to do, especially while in one's own room. Therefore, the addition of distance learning would create an epidemic of kids who are unfocused, adding to the already skyrocketing amount. In the past 10 to 20 years the quantity of kids and teenagers claiming or being diagnosed with ADD and ADHD has reached unprecedented heights. Adding these students or others to a home environment with toys, games, and a bed is just asking for problems.

One main issue with learning from home is the absence of the teacher. For, the only way for the teacher to reach his or her student would be through a computer screen. Video calls are a very useful piece of technology; however, from a teaching standpoint, they provide very little gratification, nor do they achieve the same goals compared to a face to face encounter. Depending on the time of classes and calls, the teacher and student may not always be available at the same time. This would expand the distance between the student and the teacher. Such a gap can cause a student to feel stranded in an ocean of equations, since there is no teacher to help save him or her. While most teachers hate to believe it, most students cheat. And in a room all by themselves, with internet access, there is no doubt many would cheat on tests and quizzes with ease. From personal experience, it is way to easy to find a classwork or homework assignment on a pdf document through Google.

Shying away from the learning portion of the debate, a school is a cultural hub where long lasting lessons and friendships are made. While many students feel they could go the rest of their lives without stepping foot in school again, the loss of such an important place would leave students with a weaker connection to friends and a poor social development. The lessons learned in school, don't always happen in the classroom; they can occur in the halls, the gym, or even the locker room. These lessons become part of who we are and how we continue to grow as students and humans.

Now, of course there are benefits to learning at home. A great portion of students today are sleep deprived and also through personal experience, the lack of sleep greatly affects student's grades. So, with the idea of learning from home, many kids may be able to sleep in and gain some much needed rest. This alone could boost grades for lots of students. However, there is no guarantee students will obtain an increase in sleep through the change. As the amount of sleep a student gets, directly correlates to the amount of homework that is assigned. In other words, without a decrease in the amount of homework assigned, there will continue to be tired students who fall asleep during class and struggle to stay awake during long, boring lectures.

Overall, the incorporation of a distance learning option for students is not a good idea. With students who are still tired, cheating, and struggling to stay focused there seems to be little to no gain from the plan. However, an experiment could be done with a few schools to determine the true effectiveness of the program. But, until then the evidence and the conclusion is against the addition of long distance learning. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
A23B2225BBCD,"Students all have benefits in and out of school some may struggle, while others school comes easy to them. Others my even have a hard time getting to school. This may lead some students to question themselves about even going to school. Students would benefit from being able to attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing because it helps them to stay on task and get work done, more flexible with students personal life, finally students may feel more comfortable and safe at home. These are reasons why students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Students tend to get distracted and go off task leading them not getting there work done. for an example Generic_Name and his friends are working on a group project together in English class, Generic_Name and Generic_Name start to get distracted by talking to other students about video games. Generic_Name and Generic_Name don't realize they wasted 25 talking to other students and the rest of the students turned their assignment in except for Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Therefore This lead to them getting a bad grade on a big assignment in class. Students sometimes dont even notice there getting distracted or caught off guard but it seems to happen frequently in school environments. Getting distracted is a very easy thing when students are around people that they know or even sometimes they dont know. Students will even consider going home schooled to keep focused and stay on task. Students would benefit from online or even video conferencing just to get the grades they want and not getting distracted and to stay on task.

Scholars have a big and busy life on and off school campus. Some we have no idea about. For an example Generic_Name is a D1 athlete in Virginia and attends high school. Generic_Name has a hard time planning trips and college meetings due to his classes in school. Therefore Generic_Name got emails from colleges saying there are no longer interested in him anymore due to lack of appearance. After everything happened Generic_Name lost his scholarship to Generic_School from not showing up and lack of interest. In the long run it was his high school work and classes that ruined his chance. If Generic_Name would have had the option to attend class from home or even online, Generic_Name would have benefited from that opportunity and would have accomplished his high school classes and his D1 scholarship to Generic_School. Students have a lot of responsibilities and goals in life and sometimes school can play a huge role in students lifestyle.

Although majority of students feel like there school environment is a free safe place others may feel a whole lot different. For an example Generic_Name has been going to high school in Generic_City for 2 years now. Him and his buddies decide to go eat lunch outside that evening and enjoy the beautiful day. 10 minutes go past until all of a sudden they hear gunshots coming from inside the building and people are running, screaming, and shouting. The school was evacuated and police and firemen showed up moments later. Eventually they got news that no one was hurt or injured. Generic_Name has still not been able to go back to school because of this horrible scenery. Student have possibly witnessed terrible things in their school environments and not feel safe or comfortable leaving there homes. Having the option of online or staying at home to do classwork would gradually benefit students that dont feel safe.

Finally, attending classes online from home or even video conferencing would benefit students tremendously throughout all there hardships they come across from the time there in school. School is a great place for learning, socializing, and meeting new people everyday. For others they might feel a different way from others and online or staying at home while attending school opens a new door for all students and parents to choose from. Overall student would succeed more in school by having the option of online or home because every student has a different home life, may feel safer at home, and finally to stay on task and focused. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7DD12D888212,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Most of students attend classes came from houses and we were be tired always because woke up the morning ,so I don't think way of online is not fair ,also I have other reason.

First, the online don't have to wake up early. Get up the morning is important that it one of the basic habit, so If is not use to wake up, It's going to get bad habit in the further. I said is online is not fair because we were suffering at schools and can't get out of schools until finish school but the online don't need to be suffering at school then they don't have to go school.

Seconds, schools is beginning of society or community. All of people get knowledge by people then combine to team and work together that is important, but online just study alone ,also no body around there and they can't work with someone. Most of schools have sports that help makes friend ,then other sports need to communicate to team like football team ,therefore is not just sport team that possibly is Work place, so online is opposite side because alone is not going to be happen to communication.

Finally, how to make friends in the online. Most of students don't like to go schools but when we go school with friends,schools is enjoyable little bit and If we have serious problems, we can share with friends ,also can consult about that ,but the online can't make friends easily. Honestly, how they are make friends in the online? However, Online is just bad choice in our life.

In conclusion, I can understand wake up the morning is hard and some people is difficult to make friends in the school, but way of online is beneficial. We should be join the community and when you got something hard to solve problem, ask teacher because teacher know life. Do not just sit down the chair at house. Get up from chair and just go attend the schools. Online is never helpful to life experience.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

Also being able to learn at home doesnt mean you have to walk,ride a bus and having to go to another loaction while your class room can be in down your hall. Getting to learn something at your pace would best ideal for your education.

Learning at home would give you a better way of learing things of not havng those class room's distractions. the student can go at there own speed and not having to be back tracked by other students. Timeing is also a benifit for the student because waking up go over to the computer and just taking a corse for the day is much easier than having to walk to a bus wait out side all sort's of weather is not the best way to get your education. Having the advantage of talking to a teacher one on one and asking questions and having time to walk through differnt ways to learn the subject.

Getting your educatione at a faster rate than evryone els than being in school should be be a option for those who cant make it to school anyways. Just over all getting the education is imortant is just the the way you learn it is how it counts.

77D210B9EC7E,"Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they don't need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people don't think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But i will say that people don't need to care what other people is saying to them.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
6956113E95B7,"With technology growing at a rapid rate, many things are being used through online like bank information, communication, and even education. In education there are new way of teaching students. One of them is able to teach from a distance, in which students can attend classes from their homes. Many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from their home, because they can learn anywhere in the world, students would not have to worry about getting ready to go to school, and they can learn at their own pace that lets them understand the topic or subject.

However, many people would not agree with this position, Some might argue that students can get distracted by being at home or that they might not have the same feeling of studying at their home then at school. Some students have difficult challenges in their life that let them not concentrate at their homes like physical or verbal abuse. Some people say that some students that learn through online will not even try to study at home and would get distracted by video games or other forms of entertainment. The idea that a student will learn at school the same as distance learning is thought as something that will never happen. Nevertheless their are other ideas

To begin with, students can learn anywhere in the world. They can travel to other countries or states and still learn as if he or she was still in the class. For example, In my school their are some students that travel to other countries like Guatemala, El Salvador, or Honduras and stay their for a long period of time. One of my friends went to Guatemala for a month because of his family. He knew that he was going to be behind in his classes when he would come back. When he came back, we already did two test and learned two units. He was so behind that it took him quite a long time for him to catch up. If he would have the opportunity of distance learning for the time he was in Guatemala, he would have benefited from it and still been caught up.

In addition, students would not have to worry about getting ready to go to school. Students would not have to worry of waking up early to get to the school bus or to walk to school. They would just have to wake up, eat breakfast, take a shower and go to their computer to start learning. For example, a student lives 45 minutes away from his school and has to wake up at 6 am so he can make it to his first class in the morning. It takes him 30 to 45 minutes to take a shower, eat breakfast, and choose what he will wear. In total it takes him a little bit over an hour to get ready and walk to school. If he would have done distance learning, he would have used that time to complete his homework, study, or to relax a little bit more before his class started.

Finally, Student can learn at their own pace that lets them understand the topic or subject. Many students feel that when they are at school, that the class is going to fast or that the class is going to slow. They could feel more comfortable to either go fast or slow when they learn through online. For example, Many students feel that they learn better when they are outside of school, because their is no distraction that affect them when they are at a library or their home. Distance learning can make many students learn at their own pace and practice to understand for their tests.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. They would be able to learn from anywhere in the world, students would not have to worry about getting ready to go to school, and students can learn at their own pace that lets them understand the topic or subject. Many might not agree with these ideas, but they have to realize that distance learning is an option for students to understand at their pace and feel more comfortable when they learn at their homes. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
A6FCBC1C476D,"In this day and age whether you like it or not, theres no lie when saying technology has come incredibly far. So its no wonder why people are really asking the question; "" are students better off taking online classes from home and/or video chatting with teachers"" In more than one way, No, there are plenty of valid reasons to why student should take online classes, but they dont stack up to why students are better off taking classes in regular public/privet schools.

To start it off, there are a lot of things socially about public schools that are very important for rising adults. Yes, you could say there are students that just want a chance to learn and dont care for the social aspect of school.

That may be true in some ways, but that is such a smaller percentage of people wanting be home schooled than those who dont. public school gives students a chance to build character and make possible life long friends. while being home schooled your stuck with whoever is at your house and whoever you know outside of your household when your not trying to get work done.

there is no argument that public schools are full of distractions. Especially with the technological advancement of phones. But the level of distractions at home are much higher than at public schools and thats while not trying to work. Think of how students around the work perform on there homework or whether they even do it. Now think of that but with the normal amount of school work. There is no denying there would be a decrease in performance if most students around the world were home schooled.

To give credit where credit is due. I can see why primarily home schooling most students is a good idea. It allows students to be in a possibly more comforting environment. students are able to work at there own pace, whatever that may be. But honesty there are so many more positives to public schooling, its hard to really make a argument between the two.

In conclusion, Its hard to take away from the advancements of technology seeing as home schooling is as possible as ever. there are just too many aspects of public schools that compensate for the easy laziness of of homeschooling. home schooling of course isnt all bad. there are some people that have not choice but to be home schooled for a wide range of reasons.

49F934497799,"As technology has advanced in the last 20 years, more and more opportunities are being given to students with different needs than others. Students who must stay in hospitals, or have physical disabilities have the option to take online classes. Now that online classes have become accepted by public school systems, many kids believe that these classes will fit them best. However, these distance learning options may not be as effective as regular classes. Online classes create an environment of distractions, can lead to poor work ethics, and have little to no interaction between students.

Students who take online classes at home are very susceptible to distraction. In normal school classes, students are required to put their cellphones away. At home, there is no such regulation. No matter how much attention a student places on their lessons, their cellphone will be a constant presence, with notifications going off every few minutes. Distractions can also come in the form of parents who do not have work, or siblings who do not have school. Students who take online classes can simply walk away from their lessons, and go hang out with their siblings. Overbearing parents who check to make sure their child is continuing their lessons can disrupt the flow of learning that many students enter. While taking classes at home might appear to benefit some students, the distractions that being at home provides can hurt the intake of knowledge that students require.

Online classes can also lead to poor work ethics by students taking them. In regular classes, the looming presence of a teacher motivates many students to try their best. For students who take online classes, there is no physical presence that regulates their classwork. The absence of this pressure can lead to students who willingly put the least amount of effort into their work. Being at home during class can also create a dissociation between the work and it's importance. Taking tests or quizzes in familiar environments can lower stress levels, which can be beneficial, but can also convince students they do not need to try as hard. Students may choose not to study for important tests just because they do not feel as pressured to do well. Online classwork can often be found through the internet, or answers can easily be sent by other classmates. Students who do not use homework to their advantage as a studying tool will often be left unprepared for tests and quizzes because they did not actually do their work. Students of online classes are very susceptible to the deterioration of work ethic, which can harm them in the short-term, as well as long-term.

Interaction between students who take online classes is very low. Collaboration between students is a key part of normal classrooms. Students who feel afraid to ask their teachers can rely on other students sitting near them to answer their questions. With online classes, there is no face-to-face interaction between students at all, and explanations sent through text messages can often be confusing or not helpful at all. Being in a class with other students can also create a competitive environment, which can often be beneficial to the learning space. Students who take online classes feel no pressure to do any better than their classmates, as they have no interaction with them. Their is also a social benefit to being in classes with other people, as it teaches students how to act appropriately with others, and how to handle group interaction in future jobs. Online classes do not allow for students to develop these soft skills that can help their current classwork, and their future careers. While many may argue that the group assignments that some online classes have, the interactions between students that online assignments create are very limited to interaction through text messages, and not face-to-face. Online classes are devoid of the interaction and competition of physical classes.

In conclusion, distance learning options may not be as effective as they appear. Taking classes at home can create distractions, such as cellphones and family members interrupting learning. Online classes can encourage students to develop poor work ethics, feeling little pressure to do well or use their resources to their advantage. The lack of student interaction in online classes creates an environment deprived of collaboration and competition. The ultimate goal of education systems should be to match the needs of each individual student.

Online school is a option for students who are able to access their studies via internet to help with their studies. This is a very advanced and beneficial way of learning because their are students who struggle with understanding certain subjects in the school curriculum. While being in the comfort of a home one might be able to concentrate on the task at hand and complete it with ease. For example, when taking a test the class is stressed out and they cannot focus mainly because they're in a intimidating environment that doesn't allow them to relax and let ideas come to them naturally. Many online school students have much more inspiration around them and freedom to let their ideas flow while also completing school work that is being assigned. Working in a stress-free space is also apart of memorizing work better and thinking a lot clearer. Imagine how many students would actually want to learn the material being taught and doing the work because they can understand it. When working students don't want to be put in a tight bubble they want to be able to breathe and that's why online school gives that opportunity to do that.

When it comes to turning in work on time and doing it at the students own pace it helps them with time management, responsibility, and organization. Having the student do the work on their own time shows independence and gives them a chance to process the information correctly. Not having a teacher lurk around all the time and constantly remind the class they have five minutes to complete the following twenty questions is less stressful. Having rushed papers and work because students feel like if they don't get the work done they'll have to take it home to procrastinate and let the work sit there while they fail isn't good. Giving a student their own time and space to maybe tackle a big project or something tedious is beneficial to their work ethic and creative ideas. This gives them time to also work on their personal problems like procrastination and laziness because students do get unmotivated at times.

Now, another reason why online school might be helpful choice is it could help with social anxiety or mental health. Lots of students suffer each day by leaving their house to go to a crowded and overpopulated school. Not thinking about how much stress they go through and the reason they cannot function properly is a big issue. As a result, students fail and feel like they cannot get any help because they are being put in a situation that's not only scary for them but also for their parents. Learning online might help that student achieve big goals and learn easier without all of the distractions that they might go through. The students could possibly make better relationships and maintain a healthy mindset without being overworked and having anxiety. Now, some students might not experience the ""school"" life and possibly miss out on the culture of attending school event and making lifelong friends. That overall is a big thing that students will miss when they take online school. Subsequently it will be better for them when they are doing better in school and life.

Working while in school is a different kind of ball game, simply because its something you don't do all at once but something that takes time and energy. With online school giving that person time to manage and finish work while having a job is beneficial to that person's everyday life. It gives them an opportunity to focus on task such as, paying bills, saving money, etc. So when they aren't under pressure cramming for a test they can focus on other important things. Jobs typically aren't a easy thing to do and school isn't either, but when students can balance all of the important things like studying for a paper, paying their rent on time, and going to a friend's graduation ceremony, they can juggle all three while being efficient. School from home is a great idea because it can be beneficial with everyday life, relationships and reaching your goals.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6BC2B4F5FC00,"If schools do distance learning, I feel like most kids won't get any work done. If kids don't do homework or work in class, what makes you think giving them distance learning is a good idea? Some people will say ""It'll give them the chance to be more independent, and learn to do things on their own."" However most kids hate to do work, their all about sticking it to the man. So if they do the work it won't be done to their full potential. If no one is contently on them about somthinng they aren't going to get anything done. They want to have fun and be young, they don't want to do boring work. On the other hand, I feel like this could work. All you need is the right students, and you won't have to worry about a thing. This could be great for students, they could get more one on one time with their instructor, and get a better understanding of the assignment. They can get work done without having to worry about getting judged by their peers for getting a question wrong. They don't have to worry about in class distractions so they focus more and get work done more efficiently. They won't have a bell to govern how long they work. They can work at their own paciest, and be comfortable doing it. This could work if you do it the right way. It'll take a lot, getting the right kids to do it, but it could work out fine.  ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

It would be beneficial for many as they wouldn't have to bring themselves to school at 6:30 in the morning. While being able to sleep in they get work done how they want and when they want. This prepares students for the real world when they need to know how to manage there own time for a job. Students would benefit from attending classes at home because they can have a flexible schedule, go at there own pace, and get more time to sleep.

Being able to decide when your classes are and how they will be throughout the day is a benefit of online school. Generic_Name has doctors appointment at 9 am on a Monday, but because he takes online school that won't affect him. He is able to go to the appointment and not miss any work like he would in a regular class. As soon as he gets back he can go right back to where he is and finish what he started. When Generic_Name is doing his classwork he decides that he's hungry at weird hour. He goes to get food/snack without missing any work. Generic_Name will have to get all the work done assigned to him that day but has 24 hours to complete compared to 7 like a normal school day. Having this benefit will increase student scores and avoid missing topics.

Another benefit of school from home is being able to work at your own pace. Generic_Name, an online student who does school from home tends to take more time then the average person on an assignment. She is able to take as much time as she needs on assignments without feeling rushed and worried. Generic_Name's grades will also increase due to the fact that shes able to put in her best work on assignments. People will believe this could hurt the students who try to get everything done faster to have more free time during the day. This can be solved by having a certain amount of time needed spent on a slide/assignment before turning it in. Online teachers will be able to monitor how long students have spent on something and if they don't meet the requirements they can test them. Being able to go at your own pace will really help students succeed.

With online school comes more time for students to sleep in to get there 9 hours of sleep. Generic_Name never gets enough sleep as he has to stay up late finishing his homework and wake right back up bright and early for school. But now with having school from home the day starts whenever he feels like it. If isn't able to fall asleep one night at a normal hour he is able to wake up later then usually to whatever amount of sleep his body needs. Schools always talk about students needing a certain amount of sleep, but schools make it hard to accomplish with all the work they give us. Students are able to raise grades with more sleep. Generic_Name has his hardest class first period every day and fails every test due to lack of sleep. Now having online school as an option he gets more time to sleep in and have the time for knowledge to stick in his brain. While sleeping in is nice the benefits you get from it are better.

The positives for school at home, for students include a flexible schedule, have a pace of their own, and a solid 9 hours of sleep. Flexible schedule allows students to get other daily task done with out interfering with what they need to learn. Also having that flexible time allows you to work on your own pace and get things done with quality work. Sleep is a crucial benefit of online school as it allows your brain to rest and raise your grades. With all the benefits of online school students should start leaning towards online school as its better in every aspect.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
075952A15F65,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Teaching methods have changed a lot over the years. Advances in technology have allowed many new teaching methods and ways. Students can take classes without actually being in a classroom. Opponents incorrectly believe students would not benefit from taking classes at home because of distractions and no social interactions. Although some believe students would not benefit from attending classes at home, it should be known students would benefit taking classes at home.

Furthermore, students would benefit taking classes at home because of time management. A student would benefit from online classes with time management because of a job. A student may have a job while in school. If a student is working during school hours they will not be able to attend school during that time. When taking online courses, the student may be able to fit in a session within the time they are not working. Students would benefit from attending classes at home because of making up work. A student may miss a day and have to make up missed work. If there is an emergency, and a student cannot attend an online lesson or session, the missed session could be recorded and viewed again. A student could view a whole day of lessons they have missed. Students would benefit from classes at home because of more time to practice and study. In a person's spare time, they could study and review online lessons from before. If a student is struggling with a subject and a lesson was recorded, the person can review the lessons associated with the subject. A student can be more successful reviewing lessons.

Next, students benefit from taking classes at home because a student could work more efficiently. One can work at their own pace. A student can work at a sufficient pace they are comfortable with. If a person works at a slow pace, they do not have to be strapped for time as much at home rather than at school. A person can get work done more efficiently. Taking classes at home could allow a student to get more done because of work environment. The atmosphere of an area could affect a student's work. If a student is in a comfortable and familiar environment like in their home, they could get more done. Working at home can benefit a student because there is no peer pressure. A student will not be as pressured as they are while in school. A student may present a project and they are really nervous about it but, while taking online courses the student would not have to worry about peer pressure. A student's confidence and focus could be benefited.

Even though others think students would not benefit taking classes at home, it should be known students benefit from taking classes at home. Opponents wrongly think students do not benefit from taking classes at home because of laziness and lack of organization. However, students benefit from taking classes at home because of managing time like catching up on schoolwork online when occupied with a job, making up work and reviewing lessons during spare time, and reviewing weak subjects in an online session at home. Additionally students benefit from taking classes at home because a student could work more efficiently as a result of working at their own pace, working in a comfortable environment, and no peer pressure. People need try new things they will be comfortable with. People must not hesitate on interests that will benefit them.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
12BA7182FFC7,"The opportunity of being able to learn and go to school from home is a great offer for people who have a busy life and know they do not have time to travel to school and do there daily activities. Students will benefit from this due to the fact of being able to choose when you are going to start your class and know they can do it without any clamor or distractions. For people who choose a video conference as opposed to the online classes, it will be more challenging to maybe the schedule they have to adhere to to make the class. Overall learning from home is a great chance and should be taken advantage of when you have a busy life and do not have time to go to school to take one or two classes in that moment and have to travel a good distance to make it on time. Studying from home and learning from home is the best thing only for the simple fact of being in the comfort of your own home and being able to take it to your own pace and not get lost so easily is a crucial part for when students are trying to learn. For example, in classrooms there are students who do not let the teacher do her job and make a ruckus in the room to the point where the teacher has to stop the learning process and take care of the situation. Then you are left aside wondering how to do a certain problem or not understanding well and need help. It is not easy to be in a noisy disruptive classroom while you are trying to learn and others block that from you as opposed to being able to be home in your room or in your dinning room and take all the information needed in and learn the proper way. There are many advantages as to why learning from home is a better opportunity and why it will have a better effect on people trying to learn a certain subject and being able to learn it to the point of being able to teach it.

Another example of how learning from home is a step up from going to school is if you are a single mother and you work two obs but are trying to progress in life, move on, be a role model, and give a life to your child. When you are a single mother and you have to take care of another life that is not just your own, its hard to find a moment to relax and try to relieve yourself for a moment and do something that interests you. Online courses help these types of people that dont really know whats going to happen in their day and may not know if they will be able to attend class if they go to an actual school for these classes but with these classes they can start or stop whenever they have the time to learn and relax at home with a cup of tea, a note book, and a pencil. This opportunity to take classes at home is great and should be recommended for people who have busier types of lifestyles or have a better underst6anding when it one on one.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
0CDCC84B9EA9,"I am against having school at home, because students wont be able to get help as easily from your teacher if you are struggling. There are some students who can't afford what is needed to learn at home. Some people will take advantage of being at home and decide to not do any work.

If you are struggling with your school work at home it could be really hard to ask questions. If we are doing work from home we won't be able to work with our teachers one on one; therefore, it will make it much harder to bring our grades back up when we return to school. Some students work better in a louder environment, so if they have to work quietly at home they will not be as productive as they would in a classroom, and some students just work better when they get to hang out and talk with their friends instead of working quietly. Grading would be a lot slower and harder to keep track of, since they wouldn't be able to give quizzes or tests because everybody would take advantage and take it open book, and that would take away major grades that would normally help kids catch up.

Not all families will be able to pay for the materials necessary for distance learning, because not all schools supply their students with laptops. The students with free and reduced costs at school might not be able to work at home, because they might not be able to afford the fees or costs of programs for the online classes. How will the people who can't afford to have school at home be helped, so that they don't fall behind in their classes? How would the schools make sure that everyone has the materials that they need to get their work done before making the decision on distance schooling?

There are people who wouldn't do work because they would just wanna be relaxing at home since they would have the chance. Some people would just stay home and sleep and fall further behind, while some people take the time out of their day to get their work done. Some days people just might feel like doing any work, and it would be really hard to keep on top of everyone that decides to not do work. Since everybody will be at home there would be no punishments for the students that are just deciding to skip everything, and that would just make them feel like they can keep doing nothing.

Having distance learning would be a bad idea, because it would be really difficult for everyone to get help with their work while staying on top of their grades as well. It would be extremely difficult for the families and students that cant afford to have school at home. There are some kids who just won't do the work and when we come back to school everyone will be on different units and it would be really difficult to get everyone back on track.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
27A2E22A4634,"Some believe that is better to teach children at home whereas the majority of people believe that it is highly recommended to send them to school for their better development. In my opinion it is more appropriate to send students to school instead of teaching them at home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes because it can be motivated, and distance learning is not good because it would make cheating easier, there would be less social interaction, ad they would need to be highly motivated.

One of the biggest advantages of go to school is to improve their social capacity. Students will develop social skill when they are admitted to school by interacting with their teachers and classmates. Because they come from diverse family background and have different financial statements, students tend to learn a lot from each other and more likely to realize. For example, to name a few, a bout other religions or moral practices of his peers or they can learn the habits of dressing or the way of talking about his peers.

Secondly, the growth and development of the students is assessed on a regularly basis by conducting tests, homework in a school in this area of high competition among schools to gain popularity, this process will have impact on students will make them ready to sustain in the really changeling world. For example in this area they can prove their learning, ability, and dedication.

On the contrary, teaching children at homo also has few advantages. If students are taught at home, with full attention and focus on the child, he is more likely to understand the subject well. Secondly, student can be taught in a more amicable way and be more comfortable when they are accompanied by their family at home. But they not make new friends or socialize with different people. Also some parents do not always have the time to supervise their children for that reason it is better that they go to school to receive better supervise and education.

In conclusion, both approaches have their own advantages, but sending the student to school will make him more successful in his life, while teaching him at home may result lower rates for education, but he will not be competent in the world. Also attend to school make the student stronger with more benefits to share with the world and their improve their social capacity with other people.          ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
C19E458F78DC,"Have you ever just wanted to learn but never step foot inside a school?, Some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend school from home through online or video conferencing. I think students wont be getting any benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students learn more if they go to class, they will get one on one help with a teacher so that the teacher can help the student who is struggling by seeing how well he is doing on the subject and, I believe verbal interaction face to face is better than through a computer or tablet.

Students need education to be able to graduate and pursue a carrer they are interseted in, but some students are taking online classes because they are tired of going to school but I think that learning by going to school and into classes is better because u get to interact with the teacher and she will interact with you too and help you out on what you dont understand. alot of students have trouble with some subjects staying at home behind a computer doesn't help out when your stuck.

Teachers help students on a daily basishelping students in the classroom and teaching at the same time. students who do online learning do not have the same benefit as the ones who go to school. the ones that go to school can understand more of the subject than the one with distance learning because he cannot asks question like a normal kid in school would do he would have to do something else than just ask the teacher for help. Teachers also explain everything more clearly than the computer would.

Verbal interaction face to face is better than listening to somone speak through the computer. sometimes you can't really understand what they are saying in the comuputer because it is an automated voice talking to you. Online learning isn't good because you will need internet for you to be able to use it, and if the power goes out the computer wont be able to talk or show the screen.

This is why I think online learning isn't as good as actually attending school with real teachers and classmates. Some students to this point are stil doing online learning because they have a job and dont have time to come to school and learn. Most students who use online learning is because you can choose what time you want to study because most of them have jobs and cant study at a regular school.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
F2BDB9DFFB57,"Some schools decide attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing, and the students can learning from them homes.

In my personal opinion, I think the option of some schools choose to take some classes online that is not a good idea because not all the students are going to do all the things if they are need to graduated with a good grades of the school, however is a good option because no all the students have the same opportunity to study here in the school or in home but have the possibility to study and do the school with all classes with needed, but is mostly depending of the students who wants take the classes online, because I think is more easy when someone explain the class for you, and you can understand all the things and do a good job.

But in the actuality no all the students have the same opportunity to came to school every day so all the students are going to do benefit because someones needs to work and support yourself, but if can do the classes online that's better for the students who don't have to much time to stay in the school, so now they have the opportunity to learning and watch some video conferencing online and they can finished the school online from home, however I think the students have the last decision to do, or not the classes online. In my opinion I think is better if we came to school and take the classes with us, because when we have some problems or questions, they can explain and help to understand more some things, but if we have the option to do the classes by way online I think no all the students are going to take too much time to do the classes.

For example I have one friend who came to school every single day, he do all of his work and he learn more because he doesn't have a job he have the possibility to study and get a good grades, he have more time to support in school, but if he get a job he is going to be tired most in the days in school, he are was to change is main about the school.

And other example, if a can change my classes and do online, honesty I don't want to do online my classes because I don't like the school a lot, I know I don't came to much to school because I need money to support my self, that's why I don't came to school too much and other thing i don't like the school is the language is difficult but i tried every single day to be better, and this is my last year of school, so I do everything I can to do this year better, and my opinion I never want to do my classes online I think the teachers are for helping and do the best they can for all the students. I am not agree with the schools teachers who have the idea to do the classes online because is more important the education for all the students, therefor the students improve the study in school more when we came to school and do the work.

In my conclusion I think the student have the last decision if they want to do the classes online or not ,I think is better if all the students came to school and they take all the classes with the teachers here in the school and the teachers can helping the students can learn more things that they are know, also thats better because you can distract and do a better job every day, and we can get a more education.         ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
327AAC23CF5D,"On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn.

Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school.

If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job.

And think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot.

Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing.

AC322869C365,"Some students rather attend school from home, but personally, it's notably more beneficial to attend classes from school. It is too big of a responsibility for students to wake up in their very own home and do their work and assignments. Also, It's much more interactive and reliable to be in the school enviornment. It's also much easier to achieve higher grades and expand on learning abilities.

The responsibility of having students wake up early in the morning and learn is enormous. Having to do work from the household is easily distracting to the students. They are surrounded by games, and devices that are not obtainable at school. There is a different mentality of being in a home rather a place built around learning. When at home, students are not used to spending hours upon hours learning and doing their assignments, and when bored or tired have easy access to avoiding their work and abandoning their tasks. Simply going for a drink of water or gaining easy access of electronic use with no monitorization is time subtracted from the required learning.

The enviorment of school is built around thorough plans of keeping students engaged and learning. In school, there is supervision, enforcement by the teachers and administration given to the students to do their work. Not only are students encouraged to do their work in school, but they're given more opportunities to learn their subjects and material. Students having assistance and guidance from their teachers, staff, and peers is beneficial to them because it gives them the chance of asking questions and having one on one help that's not given over a digital screen. This help leads to better grade results and better performance by the student.

There is much more than just learning that students benefit from attending a school rather their home. They're introduced to new people. Students develop social skills and bonds that they don't even know about. . There are many cases of homeschooled students who complain in the future on how awkward they are when they speak to new people, or how they interact with others. Having the chance to socialize with those nearby, speaking with them , and experiencing events with them eliminates this problem and leads to skills and relationships in the future. Attending schools sets up students for the future in not just academic or educational ways.

It's important that students are not secluded from the outside world in the future and have the chance to strive for success. Rather being in the confined, comfort of their own home, students are given more opportunities and a chance at a better life. It's concluded that schools are more beneficial to a students overall success.        ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I believe, that it would be easy to do classes at home. Because you would be able to do them when you want to. For example if you had things to do or you have to clean the house and take care of your siblings you would be able to do you classes later with out stressing out. Like me i would prefer to take classes at home for that reason that i wouldn't have to be worrying about if I got my work done on time. Or you have to do does and that when you can just do it later.

Second, reason I think it would be easier to take classes at home because you wouldn't have to deal with people goofy around or people being so loud that you can't hear the teacher and you are trying to learn but you can't. Also there would be peace and quit, no one to bother you just you alone doing whatever you have to do. And I think you would get your work done faster. Therefore you would have more free time.

This is why I do think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home! Also it would stop teachers from talking to much. And having half of the class asleep.

I really think schools should let students have classes at home more because you could probably graduate early and get your diploma, start working and get money and do something with your life you never know.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
A3E684CC43AD,"I think that in our constantly changing society that technology has become apart of our everyday lives. Almost everywhere you go you will see some sort of smart device whether that being a smart phone, a smart watch, or a smart doorbell. Technology has changed and grown significantly over the last couple of years, but school is the same as it was a hundred years ago. Students are still mindlessly sitting in chairs for hours listening to lectures about things they don't understand or care about. Technology is in almost every aspect of our lives; our homes, our cars, our doorbells, and even in our fridges, so why not use it in education. I think that students should have a say in the way they are taught so if students want to attend class from home and are willing to do the work why not. I think that students should be able to attend classes from home because they would be able to learn more and get a personalized education and they would have more free time to just be kids.

I think that a lot of students in schools aren't learning anything because one they can't learn in the environment that they are in and two they don't learn the way the teacher teaches. If a teacher has about 150 students they will probably teach to each of those students the same lesson the same way. Half of those students probably didn't understand the lesson the teacher just taught maybe because the teacher taught it to fast or maybe because she explained it in a way that didn't make sense to the student. If you have a teacher who's teaching style doesn't relate to the way you learn what do you do? You ask for help, but some students are afraid to. If student were able to work at home they could talk to the teacher one on one and ask for help without being afraid and the teacher could learn about how that student learns best and possibly teach them better.

There are 24 hours in a day. From nine in the morning to four in the afternoon students are at school, that leaves 17 hours in which it is recommended that students get eight hours of sleep. That leaves nine hours not including the commute to and from school and the time you get up so you can eat breakfast, get dressed, and all the other things you need to do before you leave the house. So lets say students have about seven hours of free time to do with what they will, but now imagine if they could go to class from home. They wouldn't have to worry about traveling or getting up super early to make it to school on time. They could just wake up and open their laptops ready to do their school work that would give maybe nine hours of free time if not more. In that time they could do so much not just learn more but just have the time to relax and do what they want to do. I don't think students get enough time to just relax and chill out with there busy schedules, so I think that having school at home would give students an opportunity they never had before that would benefit everyone.

Some people say that if we let students attend class form home students wouldn't get their assignments done and would take advantage of this opportunity and do things they shouldn't. Yes I do think this would happen if there aren't rules in place so that if that does happen the people that didn't do the work will be punished not everyone by taking away an opportunity. There are always people who will take advantage of the system that is there to help people but don't let them ruin it for everyone.

I think that this would be a great opportunity for a lot of students and would change the classroom experience. Although some people say that if students attended classes from home they wouldn't do their work and wouldn't learn anything. I think that students would benefit from attending classes from home because they could learn more and have a personalized education and would have more free time.

The school system has a way of impacting individual's lives simply due to the fact of a set schedule.

Being able to take online classes allows students to demonstrate responsibility, accomplishments, and a chance to give back to their community.

You ever sit back and realize how much work you have to get done within the day at that moment in time? Being able to work independent shows a lot of responsibility and maturity. Education is not something kids take lightly, because it depends on our future outcome. Taking into consideration the responsibilities outside of school and inside school comes with a lot of independence and organization. Likewise, the amount of stress upon students impact their ability to get all of their work done. Therefore, with the chance to take your classes at home presents a different outcome. With this outcome: Students can now manage their day with all of the other responsibility's they have to take care of. Some may say, simply by going to school in a classroom setting shows enough courage and ownership by just being there. However, demonstrating that you can manage a life without being present in a school environment, and get your work done show tremendous responsibility. Due to reasoning, students who work from home allows minors to work comfortably and plan ahead of time of what needs to be done.

We all feel a burst of happiness and excitement when we accomplish something that has been a heavy burden for us; In this case, school. Students have tons of work to get done with a short time span, so once that work consistently piles up from class to class you become backed up. On the other hand, you are the only one who knows what works for you in your learning environments, so as you try to absorb new information from your subject you can do so manually on your time. Now it has been said that if students work from home they won't actually do their work. However, majority of the time kids experience difficult comprehension in certain subjects, so they feel as if there is no point in learning it themselves. Furthermore, students feel as if they can feed off of their peers to help them get through the unit which always isn't the case. Now that you have a convent time block for work you can get it done feeling accomplished and happy that you don't have to procrastinate.

The last reason students should part take in learning from home is because it presents a opportunity for teens to get out there and give back to the greater good. Majority of the older populations doubt the younger generation in what we are capable of accomplishing. They feel as if it is too much for us to handle. However, truth be told we are the common grounds for our lives. For example, you are the type of person who loves to help other's out, and there is a volunteering experience to go feed and clothe the homeless families. On top of that this volunteering experience rewards with a 1,000 scholarship. However, you have to go to school for a upcoming test, and now you miss the chance to be apart of a great experience and benefit from a scholarship. Likewise, what some fail to realize: is that if students are constantly backed up and stressed out from school work it leaves no time to obtain new information, or simply be apart of a big impact that's exciting and important to you. People believe that minors will have the rest of their time here on earth to experience new things. However, we all have to start somewhere and for us it is throughout our life time in growing up. Not being able to participate in meaningful activities may in fact leave you empty handed with a void that is not filled. As a result, you miss out on a opportunity that may later set you back from your dreams and goals.

With all being said: Schools should present the opportunity for students to take online classes, because it promotes responsibility, accomplishments, and a chance to give back. With this greater change, students can now prove to themselves what they are capable of achieving just with the matter of time. In fact, students have to make it their mission to stay on task at home which also increases the chances of exceeding well on quizzes, tests, and other assignments. Retaining the information teachers give out, but expanding on it the way you want to learn is a great technique on remembering the concepts of that unit. This opportunity will have a positive impact for those who do not do well in a school environment or simply need things to be done within their time. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
CC149CD4B584,"In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.

The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when they're out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test.

Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

In conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,

In my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
111E90E1DB45,"Hello there my name is Generic_Name and I was wondering if you think students would actually attend the class from home rather than a public or private school? Well i'm going to tell you how I feel about it because I can imagine half of the students not taking it as serious as others would. Most students would actually attend the classes and taking it serious so they can get their education on time. Half of the students wouldn't take it serious because they are at home and feel like they can just do anything because there's no teacher in their face. More students would do it because they feel more comfortable and safe at home doing work than in school. The students are going to take it as a joke and lack because they aren't with their friends.

Most students would actually attend the classes and take it serious so they can get their education on time. The students who actually take it serious are going to graduate on time and also be something they always wanted to be in life. A lot of parents would make their child do the work so they won't be a failure in life. The ones who take it serious wouldn't be behind on the work because they are actually attending the class on time. I would allow kids to do the work at home because they can focus more and really do the work and turn it in on time. The parents shouldn't allow them to have no tech time until their work is actually done and turned in.

Half of the students wouldn't take it serious because they are at home and feel like they can just do anything because there's no teacher in their face. A lot of students would fail because they feel like they can just do anything they want to do. Most of the students would not do any work. A lot of students would just be lazy and sit in the bed and do no work and not graduate on time with their friends. I feel like the classes at home should be mandatory so all students can graduate on time instead of being a failure in life.

More students would do it because they feel more comfortable and safe at home doing work than in school. The students sometimes don't feel safe around other's because of how they act. More students feel more comfortable and safe at home because they know their environment more. All students don't feel the same at school because some feel more violated than other's. Everybody can work in different environments than other's. More young people like to work in quiet and alone places because they can focus on the work and also feel safe.

Most students would actually attend the classes and take it serious so they can get their education on time. Half of the students wouldn't take it serious because they are at home and feel like they can just do anything because there's no teacher in their face. More students would do it because they feel more comfortable and safe at home doing work than in school. I'll rather work at home because I feel like i can focus more better and actually do the work. Certain kids would rather do it at school than home because the teacher can explain the work more better in person.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
9560CB5AD3D1,"Have you ever wondered what school would be like if you were given the opportunity to attend classes from home? Some schools around the world offer advanced technological opportunities such as online or video conferencing. Students all around would benefit from online classes because its comfortable, convenient, and helps expand technology skills.

It is not an unknown fact that humans enjoy being comfortable, however this is not a privilege for those in school as individuals are expected to stay seated for eight or more hours in uncomfortable seats. Online or video conferencing gives students the opportunity to have a comfortable and safe learning environment. This is especially helpful to those who get distracted easily by others, or those who prefer to be isolated than in a large class. Students are able to focus and have an improved mood which will aid them in getting work done. Not only that, but students are not limited to their homes and they able to adjust their learning environment to the library or as they prefer. Students would benefit from online classes due to it being comfortable.

Online or video conferencing is convenient for students all around. Students nowadays are stressed and overworked; some having jobs that work into the night, combined with schoolwork and no room for sleep. Individuals that are able to take classes from home have the ability to work around their schedule. This helps benefit students by allowing them to balance out their lives. Those who use online classes will be more rested, focused, and willing to learn. This also teaches students time management and responsibility, as everything gets rested on their shoulders. Individuals benefit from online classes due to its convenience.

Advanced technological opportunities like online or video conferencing are not only comfortable and convenient, but improve technology skills. Intentional or not, students who use online or video conferencing are bound to improve their technology skills. This is a resourceful practice that will be useful for those students in the long run. Many jobs these days require some form of basic computer skills and knowledge. These students would be ahead of their competitors by having the following: being able to convert to PDF files, turning in online projects, recording projects on one device and transferring it to the computer, recording podcast for projects, improved typing and critical thinking skills. Those who attend online classes would benefit by acquiring advanced technological skills that would set them above their peers.

Those who attend online classes have a beneficial and comfortable learning environment than those who attend school in person. Online or video conferencing is available and convenient for all students as it helps balance out the individuals life and work school around their busy schedule. Advanced technological opportunities such as providing students with online classes, ultimately benefits the students as they acquire technological skills that set them above everyone else. Providing students with the option of online classes benefits the students by setting them up for success through comfortable learning, convenience, and skill-based learning that is grasped through advanced technology.  ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

I think students can be benefit because they can have more time, if they have job or they need an extra class but, they could not be or stay after school or they just cannot come to school for personals reasons I think those students can be benefit.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework it's how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate.

Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they don't want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time;

it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while they're at home.

Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just don't want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation.

I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how they're benefit.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
544B3D56A4C9,"Many people decide to take classes from home, in my opinion this should not be available for everyone. I believe that people should not be allowed to take their courses from home because they do not have much physical interaction with other people, and they do not have any type of influence ,they do not have the proper environment to study and focus at home, and people can also cheat if they are at home and giving their test.

When you are at home the whole day and are taking classes online you are not able to make any physical interaction with other people and when you are not interacting with other people you feel alone and you start to stress about things and you think that you do not have anyone to talk to about your issues which increases your stress level. By making physical interactions with people you are able to make bonds with other people and if you are in any type of situation you know that your friends will always have your back and that you can trust them, and also let them know that if they are in a situation in which they do not know what to do you are always there for them and will always try your best to help them. When you are at school you can also influence people in a good way and if you know that someone is doing something that they are not supposed to do, you can help them solve their issue or show them the right way to do the same thing and guide them to the right path. For example: If you know that someone in your group of friends vapes or smokes, you and your group of friends should tell him/her that it is not right to do that and tell them the consequences of doing that action. If all of you try hard to make that person stop doing something he/ she may listen. In this way you can influence people in a good way.

When you are at home and are taking courses online you do not have the proper environment to study and focus because when you are at home, which for most people is the place where you got to relax, your mind knows that that specific place is for you to rest so it will think that you need to rest and will not work the way it would work at school because at school you know that you went there to study and to learn something. On the other hand, when you are at home you have many types of distractions for example when you are at home your Dad calls you to help him with something or your mom calls you to tell you something or if one of your younger sibling needs help in their homework. You have to do your work but you also have to listen to your parents. So you are not able to stay focused and maybe after listening to everyone you forgot what you learned because you had to leave it half way and you were not able to learn the whole topic.

Another problem that I have heard about from several people is that when you are at home and are taking a test or an exam you can cheat. When you cheat you may get a good grade but you will not have the knowledge which in long term can harm your career. For example: You are giving a final test for Spanish. You have to speak the language and you search the translation and read it off Google. You cheated on the test and got a 90%, you passed the test but you do not know how to speak that language. Now you have a degree which says that you passed your language with 90%. You go to a collage and a teacher sees your high school degree and starts talking in Spanish, but you cheated and do not really know how to speak Spanish. Now you are speechless and have nothing to say and you get rejected from the collage. In this way it also armed your practical life.

Some people may say that there are also some people that are not able to come to school because of some specific reason or some people are influenced in a bad way at school. But that does not apply to everyone, everyone is not in bad influence and if you are good yourself you would not let anyone lead you to the wrong way. The people who say that some people are not able to come to school because of some specific reason, that does not apply on everyone. The school or the programs that provides home classes to students should take proof and solid reasoning for not coming to school and if they get proof that a student can not come to school only then allow them to take classes from home. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
477C978F3582,"Imagine you are able to take all your classes in the comfort of your own home. For many students this is reality, whether its by choice or not. In most situations its by choice since its helping the student. Many students take classes at home due to issues such as anxiety problems, being disabled, or as a way to counter bullying.

Anxiety is a mental disorder that is commonly diagnosed to people in the United States. Some have it worse than others; so much worse to the point where people have trouble being in an environment surrounded by others. That's why for some students taking classes from home is much more effective since they can actually concentrate. Anxiety isn't the only mental disorder where online school is needed; theres people who have seizures or have triggers that cause them not be around others. Theres also people who are disabled and have trouble moving around; so for them being able to stay in the same place and take different classes is very beneficial to them.

Bullying is another reason students would take classes from school. Sometimes peers make it so hard to learn due to harassment or bullying. Home is a place where many would call it safe space. Finally students are able to attend class and learn; instead of constantly worrying about being hurt or made fun of. This a very effective counter for kids who are constantly being bullied. This way they are able to learn in peace.

Some say that students are going to have a harder time learning from home due to all the distractions. While yes that does makes sense, but if a student actually wants to learn and is dedicated to it. Then they will succeed no matter where they're taking their classes. Taking classes at home isn't that much different than being home schooled.

For many students being able to take classes at home is a very useful resource. Not only does this help help students with problems but it makes it easier for students to learn since its a more quite environment where they feel safe.

B2C7EAB1488F,"Online Classes

Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing and i think it is not a good option for students because it can affect their studies.

When students take online classes, they don't understand everything. Subjects like science and maths can be harder for some of them because they can't learn everything online. When students do not have any teacher who is watching them during their quiz or test they can easily cheat. Online classes can affect their skills for example, when a student will work online he can't work in groups and he can't take part in class activities.

Online classes can take away different kind of opportunities from students, they can miss class field trips and class games like kahoot,bingo,picklers etc. By taking online classes students might have lack of confidence or in their future they will be shy to talk with their colleagues;however,due to some medical problems some students can't go to school because of that they need online classes which can help them to take either in home or in hospital. Recently my younger brother got a bone marrow transplant due to that doctors told him not to go to crowded area or in a school because his immune system is recovering from transplant. Right now he is taking online classes at Apex from home and it has saved him from being failed in his grade.

In the end i will just say one thing that everything have advantages and disadvantages but it help us to come out from tough situations or put us in a tough situations. We can't say what should be their or not because it helps some people and does not help others. Everyone understand that taking online classes have advantages and disadvantages so no one can decide that their should be online classes or not.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

I beleive students should'not take online classes at home. online claases are not like regular claases you take. online classes have their own specfic time that you have to be on your computer and also how long you have stay on your computer. The one thing it's hard about home school student it that you not going to have freinds. you going to be by your self all time. But after saying all that their is little benfit of online school. The one thing and why students want take home school is that you have until 11:59 PM to turn in your work that means you have all day to do school work and also you can search things up when you dont know. I know all this beacuse i tooked English 11 online this past summer.

Home school don't have a lot benfits. Home school means that you take your claases online it means you going to be on your computer all day thats gonna to afftect your helath .it's going to affect your helath means that it's going to make you wear glasses and you'r no longer going to see good with out your glasses. The number one thing home school don't benfits you is that it's a lot work it's like doing twenty more times work then school a day. The scond thing home school don't benfits you is that their no one to control you like teacher does and you'r not going to have help when you need help like staying after, and teachers always try to make things easy for their students. The last and the third thing is that you'r not going to have a lot freinds as how you going to have freinds in school and you'r not going to have a lot fun like no prom, no homecoming, you going to miss a lot expreince taking classes at home and you going to struggle.

Students wants take classes at home beacuse they think its going to be easy. There is some benfites taking classes at home the one and a lot people take claases at home is that you have all day to do your work and also you can wake up late if you want. you'r not going to have sedhcule like school does, when i say you can wake up any time you want it's like you go on blackborad you get the worksheet for the day and you have until 11:59 PM to do the work and after you finsh you turn it in on black bord so you have time to sleep and have fun. But the problem is that the work sheet take around seven hous to do. The second benfit of home school is that you can search any thing you want and there no one is thrtre to control you and no one is there to yell at you and tells you what to do.

I beleive students should'not take online classes at home. online claases are not like regular claases you take. online classes have their own specfic time that you have to be on your computer and also how long you have stay on your computer. i dont recomnd no one to take home school .I recomond going to school with your freinds having fun and learnig with your freinds getting help from teachers and also they exprince of school is way important then you think in your future life beacuse in your future life your kids might ask you how was school on your days. so going to school way important then you think.                                                                                                    ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
35DD0F455947,"School is something that almost everyone goes through, so why is it that if someone misses a day they just fall behind? Being able to take a class online would fix this, when a student misses a day they can turn to the lesson online, instead of waiting until their next class to try and catch up. There are many students who miss a lot of school, for several reasons, the top reasons are for sports, sickness, or vacations. There are also many students who get injured, though they can still come to school, it may be hard for them to get around, and would be easier for them to stay at home.

Many student-athletes, like myself, happen to miss a lot of school for their sport. Most sports require a lot of traveling, especially when competing at higher levels. Tournaments can be long sometimes, and then a day of the tournament may fall on a school day, and students usually leave for a tournament the day before, depending on how far the destination is they may leave earlier. Personally I miss quite a bit for tournaments, especially when they're every weekend and Im having to leave early. Some of my classes I fall behind in, because there isn't really a chance for me to come in to make up the material, when both me and the teacher are busy. Online classes would allow me the chance to make up the classes I missed during a break, or if available, download it for the trip to the tournament, or back from the tournament.

In Spider-Man Homecoming, the main character, Peter Parker, happens to accidentally miss quite a bit of school. He travels a lot in the movie and appears worried when realizing he's going to miss school. Though it doesn't show whether or not he does have the option to make up his classes online, its implied that he is going to get behind from missing a day or two of school. The movie shows how worried he was over missing a few days of school, he panicked a little when he thought about it, if he had the option to make it up online though, he probably wouldn't have been panicking over it so much. Allowing students to make up classes they miss online, would avoid them falling behind, they also wouldnt stress over when they would get the chance to make up the work.

In Harry Potter, though they might not have the technology at the time, it seems that each class they learn a lot, so if a student misses, then they're just super far behind. In this case being able to do the lesson online would allow for the students to never fall behind the rest of their class. Though there are some teachers that prefer getting to teach a student that missed their class, there are many that don't have the time for that, as well as students who can't make it in early or stay late sometimes. Allowing the student to complete the lesson online, saves both the student and teacher some time, though the student may have questions after since they can't ask during the lesson, they could still ask once they go back to school, or email their teacher.

Though there are people who say that it's best for students to learn at school, because they can ask their teachers and other students for help. Online school doesn't really allow students to collaborate with each other, but there are many student's who learn better that way. Also, if a student is to miss school, at least they have the online class to refer to, instead of just falling behind.

I believe that schools should offer online classes, as it seems like it would help any students who miss lots of school to stay caught up. Sports and getting sick are only two things that can cause a student to miss school, there are many more reasons that a student may miss, such as vacations that people may go on early. There are also students who get sick really easily or are accident prone, allowing them a chance to do their work online helps to make sure that they dont fall behind. Online school would minimize the amount of work a student has to make up when they get back, and allow the student to enjoy their time more, instead of worrying about school constantly.       ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9BFBA5356167,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. These are some reason why online school or video conferencing could work. The student will not be late to school/class, They won't miss a day of school when they are sick, finally they can focus better

The first reason why attending classes from home by online is good is the student will not be late to school/classes because,some people have a hard time coming to school on time. They wake up late or miss the bus. But if they do online school it does not matter if they wake up late or not because online is from there computer they dont have to take a bus or a car to school they can just wake up and turn on there computer to start there classes. A lot of teachers think coming to school late can affect on the student learning,but by attending online there will be no problem because school for online is on there computer.

The second reason is every kid gets sick through out the school year. they miss a lot of school days and it effects there learning. online school even if your sick u can still get your leaning done. You dont have to worry about missing a school day. When students are sick they can miss a test, quiz or get someone sick and thats not good. Online school is from there computer they dont have to worry about going to school because they are sick. school for them is on there computer and they sill get there leaning done even if they are sick

Finally student can focus more by taking online classes. They dont have to worry about someone distracting them while they are trying to get there learning done. Mostly everyone dont finish there work on time because they are talking to someone or fall asleep. Classes online you are by yourself you can do your work when u want as long as you get it done some people focus better when there is no one else in the room.

In conclusion online school could benefit from being able to attend classes from home they dont have to worry about being late to school , or miss a school day because they are sick and they focus better online school is a great way to attend school     ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FCAD8148404A,"Is Virtual Schooling More Beneficial for Students?

School is much more than a superficial institution that hands students long hours of tedious work and large textbooks. It's a place where people make long lasting friends and find out who they are as a person. It's where they find out what they like, what they don't like, what they're good at, and what they want to do for the rest of their lives. It's where students can find their place in the world. Thus, traditional school is much more beneficial than online school as virtual students miss out on necessary social interaction, hands on learning experiences, and extracurricular activities.

By having a virtual schooling experience, students miss out on essential social exposure and interaction as well as etiquette and communication- all of which are very crucial in the world today. They miss out on their chance to make friends and important relationships that they cannot do from the comfort of their house. I used to think that social skills were unimportant and wouldn't get me anywhere in life until I met one of the teachers in my school. He always emphisized the importance of social skills. He once told us that if there were two people in a room, one brilliant person with revolutionary ideas but no social speaking skills and one average person who's sole talent is talking with others and communicating efficiently, there's no doubt that the second person would go farther in life. Because it wouldn't matter if someone was the smartest person in the world. That person wouldn't go very far if they didn't know how to communicate and exchange their ideas and interact with others. That might be a challenge that a virtual schooling experience can give it's students. When in school, students are forced to interact among themselves, may it be during a group project or a class discussion. Both those activities help them form efficient communication and as well as leadership skills that they can't get anywhere else. Online students miss out on the perspectives of other students as they are isolated from the rest of the class.

There are many types of learners such as auditory, visual, and hands on learners. Because of this, teachers try to incorporate all these types of teaching into their lesson, the most popular type being the hands on/project based learning. If a student takes online classes, they will miss out on crucial lessons like these, especially in STEM based subjects. My favorite part in any science class is the labs. They allow me to practically apply the concepts that we learn in class to real life. I learn so much more from that experience rather than reading off a PowerPoint and taking notes. It allows me to experiment and make mistakes and become more knowledgeable by learning from those mistakes. Online classes, as comfortable as they seem, lack the physical and practical learning aspect that students so direly need. They cannot participate in labs or experiments or even class activities. And they cannot receive one-on-one experiences with a teacher if they are lost in the material or have any doubts.

For many students, the best part of school is all the extracurricular activities and clubs their school has to offer. This includes a broad range of activities from sports to theater and etc. In fact, many colleges look for extracurricular and clubs and service activities rather than strictly academics. They want to see students find their passion and see what they can bring to their schools. And this is where most students shine the brightest. This where an average student can excel on a sports field or the quiet, conservative students can find their niches on stage and sing their hearts out in theater or where anyone can experience national competitions in clubs such as Model UN or Debate. Students have the chance to earn scholarships and other prestigious awards they might not get from just the academic aspect of school. Students who are virtually enrolled won't get these kind of opportunities and have to live vicariously through others who are pursuing their passion. For me, I'm very involved in extracurricular activities such as Model UN, Forensics/Speech and a medical club called HOSA. These are my passions and they help me balance out my academics with something I enjoy doing. I've gotten many awards from these clubs that I could not get in a traditional classroom setting. Online school would eliminate me finding my place in these clubs and the experiences and advantages I've gotten through it.

Many people would consider online schooling as the easier option as they don't have to commute to school everyday and they can learn all the material from the luxury of their own home. And for some students, possibly the ones with disabilities or other challenges, it may be the correct option. What they're failing to realize is that while it may be comfortable and less intimidating, they are losing so much experience and real world lessons and the chance to connect with their peers. School prepares students for the real world both academically, socially, mentally, and physically. There are so many things taught outside the classroom that online school doesn't teach or even recognize, such as leadership and team building skills and etc.

While school seems to be a tedious chore for some students, it prepares them for the brutally challenging real world with unforgettable lessons that online schooling does not include. Students who take up distance learning miss out on so many experiences, friendships, and activities that normal school has. They might not discover what they're passionate in or what they are good in as they're unable to have a chance to experience everything that schools have to offer. Overall, for virtual schooling, the benefits do not outweigh the costs. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
25FC80C2D25E,"I think that, taking classes from home would help students. Nowadays, some students are not able to go to school and take the class, because of the distance problem, or some other issues. In this situation taking a class from home would benifit students. However, there are some students who are not able to learn from an online course, or they can't learn from a video. In this situation they need someone to guid them through the online course, or they can take a home tutour.

I am, a kind of student who can benifit from an online course. In 2017, I wanted to take my learner's permit. The DMV offered me driver's education class. At that time, my father was the only person at the house who had licence. He had work so, he wasn't able to give me ride every single day. So, I decided to take the driver's education class online. I spent less than two weeks on that course. After completing the course, I asked my dad to take me to the DMV to take the test. He told me that, you won't pass the test. Because, you are not ready, and how can you study by urself? it's impossible. I smiled, and told him that, trust me I will pass. Next morning, he took me to the DMV. After taking the test, when I came out, my father asked me in excited way that, what was the result? I hugged him, and told him that, I passed. My father was so proud of me, and I was so happy that, taking online class wasn't my bad decision.

My aunt lives in Denmark. She is married, and she has two kids. She is very talented, and she loves to study. One day I was talking to her about her studies and school. But, she told me that she can't go to school anymore. Because, she has to take care of her family. She was really upset and hopeless,and I was feeling really bad for her. After few days, I called her and suggest her to take the online classes. When she took the online classes, she called me, and told me that, she can't learn from the videos. Then, I guid her through the online courses that, she were taking. After a period of time, when she completed all her classes. She took her deggree in math subject. She was so happy and thankfull from me.

So, I would say that, taking the online course will help students. And if a student is strugling through the online course, or he/she thinks that, they can't learn from a video. Then, they should ask someone to guid them through the online course. So, they can be successful in their life.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FA38B62F80E5,"Historically, children have only been able to receive an education by traveling to a building known as a school. In this building, there are classrooms, desks, boards, teachers, etc., but most importantly, the outlet to a successful future. Over time, more and more developments have been made in order to improve the quality of the curriculum that students learn in school. With the rise of technology, even the location of schooling has begun to vary with the addition of a unique option: learning from home. Online video conferences and other such facilities allow for students to access the same materials that they would be given at a traditional school. However, as convenient as it seems, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, which is portrayed by the lack of three things that are vital to academic achievement: student discipline, teacher connection, and test regulation.

First and foremost, being able to attend classes from home would result in a lack of student discipline. Learning from home would discourage students from maintaining a strict schedule that would normally be upheld in a school building. For example, Generic_Name, a sixth grader, takes classes from home. The year before, he used to wake up at 6:00 every morning to get ready for school, which started at 8:00. Now, he wakes up around 9:00, because he only has four 90-minute classes to attend via video. While he may be able to get more sleep at night, Generic_Name has not established a routine for his school work, so he wastes hours before and in between classes. This leads to him not having enough time to spend with his loved ones or exercise, all because he has the leisure to slack off during the day. Consequently, there is not only a decrease in efficiency, but also in productivity, which is an outcome of the ability to attend classes from home. These are qualities of discipline, which is an indicator of success in the future.

Secondly, the direct connection to teachers would be lost if students were able to attend classes from home. In other words, students would not be able to ask their teachers any questions they might have in person. Although the video conferencing software might include a messaging system for students to communicate with their teachers, it does not replicate the same level of understanding that a student might gain if they were able to speak directly to their teacher. For instance, students who need clarification of certain material may not receive an adequate explanation online because their teacher's attention may be divided or focused on some other task. Additionally, in person, students would be able to ask follow-up questions and have a thorough discussion with their teacher, whereas a messaging system might not allow for steady communication due to breaks between answers. Therefore, there may be gaps in students' learning, which could contribute to poor performance in their classes.

Last but not least, the regulation of tests is lowered when students have the ability to attend classes from home. When assessing students' learning in a tradtional school, teachers normally provide them with hard copies of multiple-choice or short answer questions that require students to write with a pencil or pen. With advancements in technology, however, tests are increasingly being administered through software to both avoid the wastage of paper and facilitate the process of grading. Learning from home usually requires students to take all of their tests online rather than on paper, which becomes problematic when there is no teacher or reliable adult proctoring the administration. This allows for cheating and other dishonest behaviors to occur, thereby decreasing the credibility of the scores of students taking tests from home. Test regulation is necessary for schools to accurately assess the academic performance of students, so a lack thereof is detrimental to society.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to the lack of student discipline, teacher connection, and test regulation. A combination of one or more of these factors can lead to a student not meeting the standards of learning, or even worse, the requirements for graduation from school. At home, students are not monitored regularly as they are at school, which is a breeding ground for incomplete lessons and assignments. Subsequently, grades plummet, and in many cases, so does the motivation to excel. In order for education to fulfill its purpose, students should attend school in a building separate from their home. By doing so, they would be subject to the benefits of character cultivation, as they learn not only the subjects normally taught in a curriculum, but also the value of hard work and its upward path to accomplishment in life. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
C2B40B0DCC34,"The modern day schools offers online schooling to students but, does the students really benefit from it? Classroom learning is better than online schooling because of how it benefits the students in the long run. Classroom learning gives the chance to have activities and give better opportunities for the student and even the teachers. Some students learn better by online conferencing and learning through the computer but other students might not feel as comfortable doing that.

Classroom learning can give the student better opportunities to students various different ways. The first way is how a students can socialize with his or her peers throughout the day. Many kids today lack the social skills needed to make friends or even in the long run of getting a job. Further adding on to that subject the average kid talks to his friends at least once a day but if the students takes online schooling it takes the whole socializing aspect away. Another way is participating for athletics. Some Students in this modern day love sports, as a student myself I love to play sports in my free time. If your student takes online schooling you take that chance to be on one of the sports teams that your school provides. Finally the last reason is that the teacher can help the student, the teachers and the students are the most important people in schooling today. If a student takes online schooling and is having a problem with a subject, what happens if the student can't get in touch with the teacher? The student is stuck without help on the subject the need. Another scenario is what if the student is having internet problems and can not get his lesson or his work that he needs? The student is once again stuck in the same situation of not being able to complete the schoolwork he needs.

In modern day society the world is very technological, we use at least one electronic device a day like a phone, computer, an etc. Students might not be able to afford the technology needed for his or her class, and that causes tension in the modern day of learning. Some students can't learn on the computer, or they don't even like it. Online schooling creates so many factors of problems on the education of the student. Certain students are able to have online learning but in most cases classroom learning is the best option for the student. Online schooling would effect the schooling drastically.

Online schooling causes ripples in schooling today. It creates more work and stress for the teacher because she has to conference and help student by student instead of teaching the class is a whole. It doesnt benefit the teacher or even the students, it just causes a factor of problems in the long run. Again certain students might learn better online and prefer it but not every student should have that. Online schooling could effect teacher's jobs at schools and effect the learning of the students. Once again the benefits of classroom learning out weighs the benefits of online schooling.

Finally my standpoint of online schooling is that its doesn't have the benefits of class learning. Some students prefer to have online but it causes problems in the long run. Have the option to talk to your friends and talk to the teacher in persons are the tip of the ice berg in my standpoint. It truly depends on the students and how she or he feels about the way they learn. But classroom learning gives the student more opportunities than online learning and gives the opportunity to learn social skills needed in the adult world.                           ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
E45E9DC77BF4,"I believe that if a student can focused at home and do there work and find it more easy, then yes I think this would benefit a lot of student who can't always find a ride to school , wakes up really late, teen mom at home , or is a student who cant be in school because they got kicked out .This helps out a lot of people with situations at home or at school . I feel like if I was to take this position I wouldn't be able to forces because I get too distracted at home but if I was in school I would be more focused but for other its is different because they might think the opposite , maybe they can focus more at home and they might think coming to school is a distraction for them. I also believe that if the students dont understand what the program is showing them then there are always other resources like the video conferencing as provided . You dont nesserly have to see each other face to face and you could always ask others for help when needed in both situations. ",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2
67D14DACC392,"Students attend school everyday with hundreds of other students around them. The amount of small interactions one student could have with another are countless. Large public gatherings are a recipe for the spread of diseases. There has recently been a rise of concern about the infamous Coronavirus. A solution to prevent the spread of the virus includes, but is not limited to, students attending online school to lower the chances of it spreading quickly. This solution is a well advised decision. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home for many reasons. Firstly, they won't fall behind in classes when they are too ill to be in a public space. Secondly, they can still receive their education when they don't have proper transportation. Lastly, they can still interact with classmates and teachers in an unconventional setting. These are just a few reasons as to why students would benefit from being able to attend classes online.

Cold and flu season comes every year, leaving those who are unfortunate enough to have caught it, unable to attend school for at least a week, or however long a doctor recommends they should stay home. When these students come back to school, they are bombarded with make-up work that needs to be completed as soon as possible. Classes don't stop for students when they take a leave of absence. If students were able to attend online school, they wouldn't have to catch up on work because they would still be able to do it at home with the proper instructions and could still ask for help when needed. Teachers can get sick as well, sudden symptoms can make teachers leave abruptly without assigning work for students or leaving notes for substitutes. This sets students behind and could be prevented if students could attend online classes. Making online school a plausible option would also promote better attendance because students wouldn't have to physically be at school to be marked present.

While having the best intentions, public transit is often unreliable and falls short when needed. School buses can be later than they claim to be, resulting in students waiting outside in harsh weather, buses can come earlier than planned, leaving students deserted, there are times where substitute bus drivers, that aren't familiar with the streets, stray from the route, and even instances where students have to walk long distances to simply reach a bus stop. All of these inconveniences could be easily avoided if students could complete their work from home. Colleges offer online classes for students that are unable to be on campus or students that need flexible schedules. Schools could resemble the same structure college classes have to better adjust to the students.

There are some people who believe that attending school in a conventional setting is essential to students so that they can interact with others and understand topics with face to face lessons, but these things can still be achieved in an online setting. As technology continues to advance, students need to be aware of how to work these tools to be prepared for the work force. Giving students the ability to complete their school work from home is a perfect teaching opportunity and a useful skill to familiarize students with.

With the rise of concern and media coverage for diseases and viruses such as the Coronavirus, schools around the world are considering online schooling for students. This would be a precaution to prevent diseases and viruses from spreading in a large crowd. Students would in fact benefit from being able to attend online classes from home for many reasons. Firstly, they would still receive their education, even when they are at risk for spreading an illness they may have acquired. Secondly, they can still learn when they don't have access to transportation. Lastly, they still attain the people skills learned in the school environment. Schools are becoming more technology based every year, this just might be the next step.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
84367AEE6898,"I think that students will benefit from being able to attend classes online.

The reason i support this question is because some student are not able, to attend school during the day or night time for example; in others country or this can happen in any country, Some students have to work all day for pay bills or help there family buy food, clothes, etc. or they live alone with brothers and sisters and is difficult for them to have a education because they have to work for take care of there family.

Sometimes student have to go out of town or flight to others country and they have to get out of school for days or months and that is the bad thing about that because, if you mess a lot of day you can fail you classes or don't graduate on time. The good thing about online classes is that after work or when you have free time you can go online and do your work or video conference with the person you taking you classes.

Things about the online classes is that, if you can't go to school you can take it at home or any place you want, they only thing you have to got is a computer or phone internet or you can go to a public library and also if you are taking the video conference class you need a computer with camera that's all. For that i think that school that got online classes or video conference classes can help a lot of student to graduate and have a better future, or better life and they can work and help there family at the same time.

Also for adult if they don't finish school at time they can take oline classes, also if you graduated from school you can take a carrier online, and is not necesary to attend to college you can work in whatever you working and study online the classes, online is the best way for people that can not attend to school or people that work all day or travel always to study and got a GED",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
83D78B6382F4,"Education is forever evolving with the introduction of new technology. Traditionally, students go to a public/private school for their education but some schools have introduced distance learning, learning at home through online or video conferencing, as an option for students to continue to attend classes from home. Distance learning positively impacts students by allowing them to not miss school if they are ill and to get access to class options that would not have been available to them at traditional public/private school.

Distance learning allows the student to not miss instruction because of an illness. In traditional school, if you are ill you have to miss a day or even a couple of days in order to feel better. Students are advised to not go to traditional public/private school while they are sick because they could get others sick, but this would not be the case if the student was enrolled in distance learning as they would not directly be interacting with other students and teachers.

Traditional public/private schools are limited in the amount of classes that they can offer therefore, limits the student on classes they can enroll in and limits the amount of experience the student would have in the career they are interested in pursuing. Depending on which distance learning program a student is enrolled in, they may have more options as to what classes they take. This could help the student to take classes that interest them and helps them to gain experience in their potential career field.

Although distance learning limits the amount of school the student would miss from illnesses and potentially provides a wider variety of classes for a student, distance learning does not allow the student to have the social aspect that traditional school has. In traditional public/private school, a student would interact with many people from classmates to teachers. This interaction helps build social skills that will help the student later on in their careers and in life. Distance learning offers the student to have more free time throughout the day due to shorter classes and not having the immense amount of wasted time that traditional public/private schools have. The student could use this extra free time to volunteer, get a job or participate in extracurricular activities, which would eliminate the lack of social interaction.

Distance learning positively impacts students by allowing them to not miss school if they are ill and to get access to class options that would not have been available to them at traditional public/private school. Although distance learning limits the amount of social interaction a student may have, distance learning does offer a student more free time to participate in extracurricular activities, get a job or volunteer. For the reasons stated above, I believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home through distance learning.      ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
658428760D94,"Online and video conferencing learning is becoming more popular in school systems throughout the country. Some schools offer distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. While many students would love to stay at home and complete their school work, it could easily lead to many problems that could be prevented. Students would not have the ability to make friends or interact with other students face-to-face. Some students might prefer a classroom environment to help with the abilities to learn better. Online or video conferencing classes could lead the students to become less motivated or lazy. Ultimately, I disagree that students would benefit from being able to take classes from home.

Many students like to attend school because they get to see their friends and interact with new people. Having online classes as an option would take this away from students. Students would take advantage of staying home and completing their work. For example, students would have the ability to talk to their friends online but not actually talk in person and have an actual conversation with them. This could lead to losing friendships and even ruining their social skills for later in life. Therefore, students would not have the opportunity to meet new people or interact with their friends if they were taking online classes.

Other students would rather have a classroom setting than an online computer based setting. Students tend to learn better when they are in a classroom environment and can interact with a teacher. For example, if a student needed help with an assignment in a classroom, the teacher would be present and ready to assist them. If the student was taking an online course, it could take longer for the teacher to response or become available online. Having an online classroom setting could lead the student to not do well in the class or even cheat to get the assignment finished. Therefore, having a classroom environment with a teacher would be more beneficial for the student rather than an online environment.

Opponents argue that online or video conferencing learning would be beneficial to students more than learning in a classroom. For example, students would be able to work at their own pace in the class and do the amount of work they wanted to do that day. This would allow the students to be less stressed and more relaxed when learning. However, these online or video conferencing classes could lead the students to become lazy or less motivated to do anything. Becoming lazy or less motivated could result in assignments being turned in late, putting off every assignment due until last minute, or not even completing the assignments at all. Doing this would result in the student becoming behind or even failing the class. Therefore, students would not benefit from taking online classes due to the possibility of becoming lazy or unmotivated.

Online and video conferencing classes would not be beneficial for students. Taking classes at home comes with many problems. Students could lose friends they have had for a long time or their social skills could decline. The students would not have the ability to take the classes in a classroom setting and have a teacher present during the class. Some students may even become lazy or unmotivated to complete these courses and the assignments with them. In closing, students would benefit more from being at a school taking the classes than having the classes offered online at home. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

702A25E4B218,"One topic that is frequently debated is whether or not students should attend to classes from home by way of online. Some people think that students would not learn as good as they want them to learn by taking classes at home online. They feel that the teachers have to be teaching, explaining, and responding questions person-to-person to understand even faster. I believe that students would actually focus even more by taking classes at home because most of the them have jobs, expensives, and family to support.

One reason why attending classes from home online is it important is because students have another life besides school. Students would barely spend time at home. Students have to make their own choices, their own things, and their own path in order to have a successfully future. The majority of the students work a bunch of hours and get off from work very late. They would not like to wake up early to go to school the next day.

Another reason why is because students need to pay their expensives. They have the necessity to buy things as well, to pay their bills, food, and rent. Students would neither be able to achieve their goals, nor have a pacefull life without any struggle if they don't pay their expensives. In order to have a life out of debts, they must work for their necessities.

The final reason why is because some students have their families back in their countries. They support them and they also give them an economic aid. The more money they make, the better it is because not only their parents help them, but them. We are a diversity of students and each one of us have different reasons, purposes, and persuits.

As you read, everyone think differently and have different reasons. Only when we know our responsabilities, our effort, and our situation; we will realize that some of us need an opportunity to succeed on our own way. Our families will be proud of us.

I feel like less students will drop out of high school. Some students are anti social and, don't like being in a place where everyone likes to judge you or, talk about you. Students don't have to stressed out about work that is not finished in class so, homework will be a thing in the passed. People like me will have more time to play sports and, be with family.

The main reason is, they don't know the knowledge by themselves, If they were to asked to attend the class in which the professor teaches something they already have known, it would be pain. Not attending class students can control their time more freely and are likely not to waste time. Although, I agree that there may be one or two advantages to not attending class. I insist that the advantages of joining classes far overweight them.

In the first place, professors can teach students a lot of things that can't be otained from books. In the book, normally there is just concentrated knowledge. The professor will not only teach them some knowledge. The professor will let the students know how to use and develop it.

Students will be benefited from the discussing with your classmates if they are attending classes. Different people have their own special capability. One people cannot be good at everything in life. What is the best way to share your knowledge with others? Go to the class! Professors always give some topics for students to be able to think about amd discuss it.

there are cases where students have alot of potential but when it comes to school you just can't pinpoint what their problem is. One cause of the causes we could be that they are slower learners and they need that extra one on one time online learning can be just the place for that. tutoring is out of the question for someone who dosnt have a reliable source of transportation to and from school, but with online enhance learning they can sit at their home and get all of the help they need.

Online learning can also help kids that dont feel comftorable learning at school there are so many distractions and other things to keep your mind off instruction in some classes that it can make it hard to learn properly at times, beng at your house confrence calling is a way to cut that completely out of the equation and have students focus on what they need to be paying attention on. Parents can also help by making sure their child is getteing all he can out of the instruction.

students also will be less likely to get sick participating in online learning. colds viruses the flu is all apart of the public school system, the contact a child makes at school is enough to get anyone sick and it could coe home to spread to their families. online learning eliminates that and can make sickness less common among school students.

on he other hand there is the possibility that a student can afford a compter or tablet to participate in the proceedings. but schools can issue them out and and put warranties on the computers to make sure they get them back allowing for acces to the school.

online learning is the best way to go with learning it will make learning in school easier and more effective for students and make learing feel with a teacher feeel more personalized.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5.53E+11,"What if high school students did not have to go to school? Rather, what if they could take classes from home? Some high schools offer online classes by website or video conferencing. Many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it teaches them to be accountable, they don't have to come to school if they are sick, and some don't have to face bullies at school.

Most students who attend high school are constantly relying on their teachers to remind them when they need to do work. If students forget to turn in their work, they sometimes blame the teacher for not reminding them when the work is due. However, if students attended online classes at home, they would be responsible for what gets done. They can do their work anywhere by means of technology such as: laptops, tablets, and cell phones. This prepares high school students for college, and their future adult lives by teaching them to be responsible for their own time and work.

Quite often, many high school students become terribly sick. Many sickly students despise attending school. They're tired, contagious, and probably unable to focus. If they miss school due to illness, students miss hours of education that heavily impacts their grades. If students could attend class online, they would not miss anything taught at school that day. Students could work from home without passing on their sickness to other students or missing any important knowledge necessary for them to be successful.

Unfortunately, many students experience bullying from other students at high school. It heavily impacts the bullied children and they're mental health. Many of them no longer have the desire to attend school afterwards. To solve this dilemma, those students could have the opportunity to attend online classes from home. At home, they don't have to face monstrous bullies, and they can focus on their schoolwork. This would greatly benefit the defenseless students by helping them to be successful through education without attending high school.

Many high school students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it teaches them to be accountable, they don't have to come to school if they are sick, and some don't have to face bullies at school. Therefore, more schools should offer online courses and video conferencing for students because it is less beneficial not to do so.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
351EB4DBB252,"My opinions are if the students have wife access from their homes i think that they can attend classes from home. That is the best way to do some work for example projets or homeworks if their teachers give them to do. Also i think that students would benefit because there is something they may be learning how to get it done, and they will have time free to work on it. For the video confering most of the students don't like to do too much work because they are lazy sometimes, and they prefer the easy way to get it done quickly.

I know why i say all this because i am a student, and i also know how things work when we have some classes online. most of students feel great, and some of them don't like to work on it at home. For me i will say that it is better to achieve in class. let's just say that it is better idea to be focused on what you have to do.             ",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2
4D23A7FA9408,"Although some say students wouldn't benefit attending classes from home because students will not have the opportunity to work in groups with other students, actually students would benefit attending classes from home because they will feel comfortable and students can be more safe.

Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldn't benefit students because they can't work with other students. Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes don't have the best projects just because they can't have other student's opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a person's ideas.

However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated.

Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe. Lately, more than hundred school shootings had happened, so it show us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a child's life.

In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they don't have to be worried for their child's safety.

As you can see students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can't stay connect with other students, actually being able to attend classes from home would make students feel comfortable and secure. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

But some moms and dads dont think its good for them kids but it is because if they have to work then can still do there school work when they get home and still have time to do them and can sleep more and dont have to get up at 6am in the morning and they can hang with there friend when there done with work but they might be a little sad because they dont get to see there friends as much when there at home doing there school work but i world love to do my work at home were i dont have to be in class all day with people because i really dont like being i rooms with a lot if people in the class rooms and one my friend say in more easy dont your work at home because you feel more safe at home with your mom are dad can help you when you need help.

Some people it hard for them to work with people in there class rooms when they dont know them as much and its just hard for them to get a hang of it and it not okay for them so working at home is good for people like that it will help them more and if they work in a class room with kids in there they might not pass so if they work at home it will help them more so they can pass.

AC0FEEED417B,"Children in these days have so many pressure in life, but do you know which of theme all is the most terrible stage that they have to face? Well, I believe that the most of all is when our young ones go to school with other types of kids. kids up to teenagers have to face really bad influence from peer pressure, tell them to do wrong stuff , or even change their personal attitude against their parents. So the question is do you think students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I would have to say yes, because if i was a parent i would rather be able to over throw that obstacle of their way and do not have to worry about it. one reason why i say this because my sister is having this problem in her school with this so called ""friends"" that she was hanging out. And later my parents found out she had a instrugram account without my parents permission of creating an account by her self and not only that she was also had some stupid photo of her putting her middle figure up for profile photo . second reason why students should take online courses for school is because students who take home school are more advanced then regular students and are able to take their own time and past at home. for example,I have faithful friend who i known for some years that is right now is both 10 and 11. He tells me that he loves more than when he was attended to a public school because it was really stressful for him from all the homework,peer pressure,drugs,and the time he wanted to take to do other sorted of stuff he wanted to do. My last reason is students can learn or change their way of doing things or just how they act differently thought the years go by until they graduate from school. I think to my self,what if all the students of the world would not do this tragic things,or if we all was perfect humans beings and just do what we have to do in life to succeed our goals in life. But,unforgelaly not. Because we live in this world of hate and full of death. In conclusion, i do believe that students should have the opportunity to have home school or online courses they can take to prevent to peer pressure,to take their own time,and to to be influence by bad people at public school.              ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
72C2648F9AA4,"Have you ever considered online school? Some schools are offering an online option for students via video conference or online course. Online school has many benefits allowing students to learn disregarding the weather, allows students and staff to have more learning and free time, and students can re watch the video classes allowing the students to go at their own pace or if they do not completely understand the material.

Some argue that online school would make it harder to ask teachers questions but, teachers and students would have more free time and learning time due to not having to take the bus or any transportation. Furthermore, if you were to subtract the time it takes to get to school and back and the time it takes to walk to classes you would have more time to ask questions and have more potential learning time with the teachers. This is important because it allows students to take more time learning and ask more question and classes would be less rushed.

Another benefit of online school is the fact that students can learn disregarding the weather or if they are sick. For example if a student is sick they can still attend class from home and not miss a day of school. Another example if there is a snow day the entire county can still learn and not be held behind due to weather.

Another benefit of online classes would be that it allows students to re watch video lessons and fully understand the lessons. Some students may have trouble fully understanding the material at fast paces but, online classes would allow the student to re watch the material and can spend extra time on certain subjects that they have difficulty in. For example if a student has trouble in math because they need more time or has forgotten the material they can review the class again.

In conclusion online school and courses has many benefits and could improve learning and allow students to fully understand material and provides more time for learning and questions. Online school also allows students to learn on snow days prevents students and staff from falling behind on material. I advise students to propose the idea of online school or have a discussion with your school administrators because online school and courses holds many benefits.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
468EF37C2F2C,"Distance Learning as an Option

I'm agree that some students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, if the students are sick or have an appointment they never can missed a class day, the students can have a job and take the classes at the same time, and the students who get suspension they can have the classes online.

First, if the students are sick day never can missed a class day. Sometimes, some students dawn sick and they missed the class, but if they attend classes of online they just have to go in the web site and take the classes. For example: Once I was sick for two week and I missed the classes for those days, but the schools offer me to attend classes from home. That helped me, because I don't continue missing classes and I did all my classwork and homework that I missed. I think so, this can be easy for teacher, because when I was sick my teacher just explain me and give me the homework , and we end the video conferencing. Also, it is a good idea be able to attend classes from home, because if they students have an appointment they just can do a video conferencing or can do online if they are doing somethings.

Second, the students can have a job and take the classes at the same time. Some students who come to regularly classes they just have a part-time, but they want get a job all day. If they have distance learning they can work and take the classes. For example they can have a video conferencing in lunch time or they can ask to the manager if they can have a hour of break. I have a friend who took distance learning, he worked from 7:00 a. m to 9:00pm. But he talked with his manager if they can have two hour of brake and when his has his break he called by video conferencing to his teacher. Also, it is interesting, because they can learn to be responsible, be organized and used them time wisely. If the students come tired from them job they can be relax in them bed and can do them homework in online.

Finally, the students who get suspension can have classes online. In this year of school I saw liked six fights, it is too many fights. The principal give them five days or more of suspension, and they missed those days of classes. They can have this privilege of have classes online or video conferencing. Although, it is not problem of the school, because they look for the problem, but can be a good action for the school give them this privilege and don't missed the classes. Also, when they come back to school can have another problem with come else. In my opinion the school have to give them all year of suspension and give them distance learning, for they can learn to be good person and understand that the school it is for study don't for fight. Anyways they benefit, because they don't missed classes and they always can graduate. The parents can be attentive to his son and her daughter that they are doing the right thins or if they are doing the work.

In conclusion, the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Can be a good idea that all schools have the distance learning option. This can help all the students and be easy for the teachers. To some students cannot benefit, because maybe they don't have a job or don't make problems. Next, the students can be sick or can have an appointment with the doctor and they just can do a video conferencing. Also, the parents can see if her daughter or his son are doing the homework or pay attention to the teacher. Some students benefit because they want have a regularly job and don't can, because they have to go to school. In my opinion, if they made me make a choice if I want a distance learning I will accept, because it is a good opportunity to have another things to learn and make many things different on the same time. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
91A00DFD46DC,"Distance learning not only flexible but also beneficial to students who struggles attending school. School is about seven hours long and starts early in the morning. There are students who cannot simply meet ends when it comes to school along with the timing and environment. Students who struggles with attending school tend to struggle with mental issues, problems at home, or preference.

A big factor of students failure to attend school results to ongoing mental issues. Students who has depression, anxiety, or any sort of mental issues typically is harder for them to attend school while something is off. Mental illness tends to make people tired, unmotivated, sad, distracted, etc. I struggle with depression and anxiety, along those lines it is harder for me to wake up and I lose the will to go to school and sleep instead. I have no motivation to do homework, interact, or leave my room. Missing a lot of days will cause you to be behind and you're left with a pill of graded work and nothing but anxiety attacks and breakdowns. It's like a never ending cycle and being put in distance learning to provide the alternative option to make up for the lost times.

School is hard enough but making ends meet while having bigger, harder issues at home won't make it any easier. Underprivileged students struggle with abuse, money, and adult responsibilities. Students cannot afford their own transportation or cannot make the bills or groceries. This results kids on taking responsibilities, such as getting a job, to help with food, bills, and clothes. Students in these position may be suffering with poverty or parents/ guardians who are not fully capable supporting their kids due to addictions, overworked, or personal issues. These students are over worked and does not have the ability to make it to school simply because they don't see it as important as trying to survive. Not every student want to go to school with a bruised up face or beaten bodies because they're being physically abused. Students are afraid of their parents, especially when it comes to beating and fear of getting their parents caught up and getting a beating due to that. Not every student that attends school has the privilege to go back home with a loving and welcoming parents greet you, a fridge full of food, the bills are paid, and clean clothes. Attending the distance learning will provide a easier education working around their schedule and giving them more free time to either make ends meet or to work more hours.

It's hard enough to wake up early in the morning, get dressed, and go to school. Students has preference when it comes to their learning environment, like adults when it comes to their work environment. Unlike students, they typically cannot pick and choose when they are restricted to the school district within the distance of their home. te process of transferring out will be tougher since they have to provide their own transportation and pay the fee, the chances of that happening are unlikely. Along with transferring out, some parents would not allow it due not understanding their child's reasoning or are completely blindsided by the ongoing issues. The environment is such a big deal, it can negatively or positively impact a student based on their needs. Not every student wants to go to a place five days a week, seven hours a day to hear teachers get on them, students being loud in the halls for no reason, unnecessary drama, or simply a place that makes them feel trapped. Not everyone can work around so many people and be trigger instead. There are students who prefers doing everything online and about 75% percent of class work is online now these days along with exams and finals. Having to switch to distance learning won't be much of a change since schools are currently converting to online classwork, tests, activities, and homework.

One may state that distance learning will make cheating a lot easier. Students may have easy access towards the internet making it easier for them to cheat but there are programs restricting students to exit the site. Although it may seem like a bad idea, teachers requires students to show work and that clearly an easy option when it comes to cheating. This will makes the student research the unit and teach themselves while in the process of learning. There is such a positive effect with it comes to distance learning and it will teach students to be on their work without anyone telling them, learn the ability to teach themselves, and a form of communication when it come to contacting their teacher or simply asking for help.

Distance learning provides a great alternitive to students that have a hard time attending school. To students that struggle, there are always going to be bigger issues that they will priortize over school. These students wants to try and with distance learning this will give them to opportinity and work with their needs or timing. Things such ass mental issues, personal problems, and their work prefernce will always get in the way and he best thing to do is to work around it rather than forcing them to go. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
32AA6481C3FA,"Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, by way of online or video conferencing. It would greatly benefit students who cannot go to school due to an illness, as they wouldn't miss any of the course work that they would otherwise spend time on caching up on, and they would not fall behind the rest of their classmates. For example, if a student is not able to go to school for a specific time period due to an illness, then that student can take the offer of distance learning as an option instead of missing out on classes and course material while they are not able to go to their class.

Distance learning could also help students who don't feel safe at schools a better chance to learn, as if a student isn't comfortable in their working environment, then it would be difficult for them to learn, and rather they stay home and miss out of their school work due to the felling of not being safe in their environment, distance learning would greatly benefit them by way of video conferencing their classes at their pace at their own home, a place that may be seen as safer by these students.

One thing to note is that perhaps other students who can physically go to school may abuse their right of skipping school and instead take online classes when they don't have the need too, however to that claim, it is better for them to still learn the coursework and skip school then for them to skip school and pay the price by missing their classwork.

Distance learning also help students by just being an option available, as they wouldn't have to then stress about missing school if they're sick or unable to go, as they would then have distance learning abilities as a backup.

In conclusion, the inclusion of distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online of video conferencing would benefit students such as those whom, cannot go to school due to an illness, and those don't feel safe at school. Distance learning would also help the general student population by just being an option if the occurrence arises that they might miss school for an indefinite period of time. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
53DCD2003C08,"Distance learing is a great option for students. It benefits students who prefer to work from home when a physical public school is a difficult option for them. Its a great option for students who have a hard time staying focused in school enviroments, suffer with a disability, or students who overall want a 'stright to the point' education. Online education is a great option and should be offered at more school disticts.

Public school is a very distractive enviroment. Most students have a hard time staying focused with all the extra distractions like bullying, drama, and relationships. Thoughout my time in public school, I have often refused to go to school for a period of time because of these distractions. We are often getting told "" You come to school to learn' or ""dont care what your peers think"". It is unrealistic to put children and teens in a building for almost 7 hours a day and expect them to focus stricly in school and not build friendships or drama with other children.

Online school is also a great option for students who stuffer with a disabiltiy. Not every child is fortunate enough to be going to school everyday for something beyond there control. Some children may have a serious disease that causes them to be in the hosbital or at home for a long period of time. Others might be suffering with depression, issues at home, or even a death in the family. Online school should be an open option for them because life is not fair to everyone. These events should not stop a student from reciving their education.

Lastly, Some students would want a ""stright to the point education"". We often have teachers who get of topic and waste a lot of time in a unit. Teachers always stop the lesson over a child who misbehaves and keeps the whole class behind. They often slow down or go to fast to keep everyone a the same pace. It would be more benefitial have an education that goes in our own pace and not of the other students. We all learn at different paces and not all students learn the same. 13 years is way to long to learn basic education. Much of the material we learn in school is basically the same thing but slightly more materal added. For example, My core classes except math has not really changed much since the 8th grade and we learn the same things every year. This is especialy true in my english classes because I havent noticed anything new in the rubic since middle school.

Overall distance school is a great option for students and has many benefits. It helps many students when public education is difficult for them. I hope that in the future, online schooling will be more accesable and a easier option for students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D79A5C8FDE2C,"Many schools around the United States offer a multitude of online classes that students can take from home. In matter of fact, these classes can be electives or actual course classes, like English or math class. Furthermore, students having the opportunity to enroll in online classes can be super beneficial in many different ways. For example, students who may have disabilities can take online courses to make school easier for them or students who do after school activities, like sports can take online courses so they will have more time to do homework or complete other classwork. Even though many people would agree that taking online classes is beneficial, others believe that it isn't beneficial at all.

First off, the majority of schools around the United States all have students who may have a disability. Unfortunately, for some of these students with disabilities, it may be hard for them get up on their own or even leave their houses. For these students to have the opportunity to enroll in online classes that their school offers, this can be greatly beneficial for them in a lot of ways. For example, these students won't have to worry about falling behind in school or missing anything important. Also by taking classes at home, will help them still get the right education they need in order to be successful in school, so they won't miss out due to their circumstances.

As a matter of fact, I have a personal experience with taking online classes. Personally, it helped me a lot and I really enjoyed taking an online course both my freshman and sophomore year of high school. Furthermore, I am athlete who trains for five hours everyday right after school, and I found it very challenging to juggle between student life and athlete life. I knew I had to do something that would help me balance my school work and my practices. Having the opportunity to enroll in an online class, so I would have more time to complete homework and other classwork and still be able to train for my sport was probably the best offer I have ever got and it really benefited me in both student life and athlete life.

Although many people would agree that online classes are very beneficial for students, there are others who would strongly disagree with that for many reasons. To continue, people think that students having the opportunity to take online classes won't help benefit them at all, because students will be distracted at home and won't pay attention in class. Also, others believe that students will cheat their way through the class and won't actually learn anything. Adding on, what these people need to realize is that the majority of students who take online classes take them for a specific reason, and it is mostly to help benefit them in school. In my experience with online classes, it greatly benefited me and many others who did the online class with me.

In conclusion, a lot of schools around the United States offer online classes for students to enroll in. These online courses are offered in a variety of different types of classes. Such as, English, math, and even art classes, that students can take throughout the year. Furthermore, having the opportunity to take these classes can help benefit students who may have disabilities or who are involved in after school sports.

E032A417EBD1,"Classroom learning is seen as the standard for public education, but soon, this could change. Distanced learning is a schooling option that most overlook due to its abnormality, yet this fairly new type of education could transform the lives of many. The idea of sitting in a classroom with at least twenty other students isnt the most helpful type of learning for a multitude of students. Those that argue this type of schooling makes it harder for growing children to develop important social skills, fail to realize that this is not the best/only option for every student. Distanced education is extremely beneficial to an array of students due to its flexibility and isolated setting.

Attendance is something that holds large amounts of students back from graduation, yet frequently missing school isnt a choice for some students. Often times teenagers with physical and or mental illnesses are required to miss school as a result of their doctor/therapy appointments. These students are then plagued with stress, when they could be utilizing that time to focus on themselves and recover to return to a ""normal"" school schedule as soon as possible. Online courses move at the students speed, and makes it so that one can continue at their own pace and pick up when its most convenient for them. The common school schedule (seven to three) doesnt consider what is best for these type of students, and forces this non-negotiable time slot on them. On the other hand, online education creates a flexible and customizible schedule that works with all.

Anxiety is a type of mental illness that causes constant worrying, and sadly it affects an alarming number of high school students. The students that are cursed with this illness are not found to strive in the ""normal"" classroom setting. If alternative types of learning were made more common and accessible, unnecessary anxiety and worsened mental health could be easily avoided. Isolated learning makes the education experience less stressful and much easier to manage for those who struggle with mental illness, and even those who just prefer one on one learning. Isolated settings dont work with every student, and this is why it is not the only option.

Distanced education is tremendously beneficial to a variety of students due to its flexibility and more comfortable setting. This type of education is not the only kind available to students, it is an alternative type for those that could benefit from it (as many can). Preferably, distanced learning would not be a permanent solution yet one that could be appreciated in its time of need. Many students would benefit immensely from this type of education as it has the ability to work with all different types of students and all different types of situations. Despite the benefits, this type of schooling would only be utilized when necessary. Think about the amount of students that could find success with this alternative kind of education, why would this idea not be considered?",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
8BD74B7B3DE2,"The opportunity to attain a new style of education such as online schooling should be taken because, If students dont live near any schools that can provide a good education they can do online classes for a better school, If a student is sick they dont have to miss any class work and have their grade effected, And if a student has to leave their town they would be able to keep up with their work.

Some students who live near lower quality school wont get a very good education, But if they had online classes they would have an opportunity to learn at a higher level. Generic_Name lives in a low income area of where he lives and his education is not going the best but with online schooling he could receive education from elsewhere. There are millions of students just like Generic_Name that just want a better education, and with online school this is possible. This isnt just low income areas many schools in higher income areas give poor educations too. Generic_Name lives in north Dakota and there are NO schools in his area but with online classes he could attend online school in a different state. Rather than living near a low quality school Generic_Name dose not live near any schools at all. With online schooling Generic_Name could get the education he needs to be a success in the modern world. In conclusion online schooling give learning opportunities to those who would not normally receive them.

Students all over the united states and the world get sick everyday, But with online classes obstacles such as these would not be as detrimental. In October Generic_Name missed two weeks of school because he had the flu and couldnt leave his bed but if he would have had online classes he could just have done them from home and not have had his grades impacted so severely. Like many others Generic_Name had become sick and had to miss school and many assignments if he would have been able to do his classes online There would have been little to no impact. If more schools would pick up online schooling there would not be incidents like this anymore. Generic_Name recently got back from a trip to France with his family and unfortunately was infected with COVID-19 ( Coronavirus) and now he will have to miss an extended period of school and be quarantined meaning he cant receive an education, But if he could do his work online he would be able to continue to receive an education while quarantined. This being a much more serious scenario of missing school that as of right now schools should start to take into consideration, none the less having online school would solve one of the problems this child is facing. Both of these students could have their grades remain intact if there was online schooling. In conclusion there would be no more need for sick days if when a student is sick they can just work from home.

If a student has to leave town for one reason or another they would still receive an education along as they had access to a computer. Generic_Name went on vacation to Generic_City with her family four days before spring break started so she missed a little bit of school, But if she brought a computer she would not have to fall behind. Generic_Name had to miss school but she had a computer with her so there would be no problem if she could do her work online. This might seem silly to some schools but it would be very helpful to students. Generic_Name had to leave Virginia because her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and her family wanted to spend time with her in her final months if there was a computer there Generic_Name wouldnt have to miss any class work. Some scenarios of students not being in school are much more serious and the make-up work could be solved while they're away. If there was online school Generic_Name would have one less thing to worry about when she returned. In conclusion online school could help students with catching up on missed class for any reason.

In conclusion if students could attend school online it would solve problems such as, Not living near any schools or any decent schools, students falling ill and being un-able to attend school regularly, And finally If students needed to miss school for family matters. Some might say that having students learn online would encourage them to procrastinate or just skip but not all students are going to just skip school and procrastinate this would actually solve a big problem for many students. In conclusion schools providing online school would solve many more problems than it would create, and it would create new teaching jobs.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

However, not all students have the focus and determination like others to be able to hold themselves accountable for completing their classes at home without a physical instructor. Despite this, I think students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home, rather than at school, as it would give students the opportunity to learn at their own appropriate pace and it would provide a more comfortable learning environment with less distractions.

While in the classroom, it is difficult for teachers to go at a pace that isn't too slow or too fast for every single student since not every student learns at the same pace. I consider myself a relatively slow learner and writer. Therefore, there have been several instances where my teachers would be lecturing and giving notes, and I found myself missing key information because the teacher was not allowing time for us to write it down. However, unlike my other teachers, my history teacher will make us take notes at home. In this instance, taking notes and learning from home, helped me retain and learn the information better than if I were at school because I was not constantly stressing about the teacher switching the slides, and therefore, potentially missing key concepts. Giving students the opportunity to learn from home allows students to make sure they get all of the necessary information that they may need for later success on a test. It also gives students time to be able to make sure that they understand the information on the notes, rather than just typing or writing it down without understanding the meaning behind it. In addition, some of my teachers make assignments due at the end of class, despite some students, like myself, not being able to finish within the time constraint. Although I understand that it is important to be able to complete assignments quickly for the future, I think that in a learning environment that should not be the case. Learning is not about being able to complete an assignment in an hour, but it is about being able to understand new information. Therefore, I think learning from home provides the best learning environment for every student to do well in their education, since they don't have to constantly be overshadowed with the stress of time on important assignments. At home, students are able to ensure that they turn in quality work that will help improve their grades rather than hurt it because of a time constraint. Students should be given the opportunity to take classes from home because not every student learns identically and as quickly as others.

In the event that students would be able to take classes from home, they would also be able to learn in an environment that ensures their greatest focus and success. However, this can be difficult when there are constant distractions in the classroom. For example, in my Pre-Calculus class, there is a specific group of students who are constantly found talking over the teacher as she is trying to teach. Not only does this distract the teacher, but it also distracts me and the other students who are trying to learn the material. To avoid instances like this, students should be able to learn at home where they can sit in a room all by themselves, free from any outside noises or distractions that may hinder their learning. Other students, and sometimes teachers, are simply just added distractions that make it even more difficult for students to focus on learning the information that the teacher is trying to teach to the class. Similarly, while in my AP Chemistry class, since I am usually one of the last students to finish the test, there is always a constant moving of students and whispering among the inconsiderate students who cause me to lose focus. It is very challenging for students to concentrate on their thoughts when they are followed by constant whispering and movement going on in the classroom. These distraction may cause students to either get the question wrong or run out of time, therefore, hurting their education. Furthermore, I constantly find myself being more focused doing my homework rather than trying to do my work in school because I am given an appropriate and quiet learning space that helps me concentrate on what I am doing. Allowing students to learn from the comfort of their home helps minimize the many potential distractions from other students and teachers that only cause problems with the student's concentration.

While trusting students to learn independently may not be appropriate for every student, it can be an important quality for other students to learn the importance of being responsible for their future. Many high school and college classes have leaned greatly towards using technology for student's to complete and turn in assignments. Nowadays, teachers and professors are mostly used for lecturing which can easily be transmitted online. Therefore, as the years progress, and technology grows to be more influential on society, schools should consider taking advantage of technology to ensure a better educational system for every type of student.  ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
44AD6D44FD83,"I feel like that shouldn't be an option for students. Not only is that not helpful but it can cause cheating and Not working to full pontential. Also some people could be more hands on and need actual help. I don't feel like it's helpful because people can over sleep and people will skip lessons to get out of taking the class just because there at home. Also people wouldn't work with their full pontential. Because they can use their phones to cheat. And use others for help instead of doing or getting the work for themselves. Some people need for it to be shown to them physically. For example, I need a math word problem to be drawn how it's shown like picture wise. And videos or online class is not good for teenagers. It makes them more antisocial and depressed. The only reason why I say it can make teens antisocial is because their not around their peers. And they really wouldn't have anyone to talk to or vent to. And it would be no clubs or after school activies they could use to keep them out of trouble. And they will regret that later on in life because when they get a job and have to work with people their not going to like that because their so use to working by their selves. I personal don't think it would beneift teachers either. The only reason why i state that is because some teacher really love teaching and being their for help and support. Some people meet the love of their life in high school. Some people couldn't experiance that because their ""working from home"".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
3741469BB646,"Is online school the best way for students to learn in this generation? Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. By giving students this option they will continue their schooling through being home schooled. Many parents would most likely have their students take an online class especially if their student is a student who plays sports. I think students should refrain themselves from taking online classes because they could have a lack of focus, if they need help in a subject they can consult their friends or a teacher in person, and they would be better off working in a class setting.

In a general class the max of a high school class is about 30 students. If you're a student who likes to focus in a smaller class they can always make arrangements. Working in a classroom can help you stay in check and prevent you from losing focus. There are so many distractions that can come towards taking an online course. You could be persuaded into watching t. v or playing video games. With that being said, you would have to set a lot of ground rules for yourself to prevent you from falling into those temptations.

Many students tend to find subjects that they are taking very difficult, but that shouldn't discourage them in asking for help. That is the bright side of taking classes in school, because you will always have people to help you. Having that one on one communication with a teacher, in person, is the best way to help. You can never go wrong with communicating with a teacher or a friend. Being able to sit and listen to ways that can give you a better understanding on something you don't understand is a great way on getting better.

Working in a class setting would be better off than online. With a class setting, students can work on their assignments hands on. In that way, the students are familiar with the source and can help them to remember in case they would ever need it again. Also, you wouldn't have to worry about working on assignments by yourself, because you will always have others to help if needed. Although there are benefits of working one on one communication with an online teacher, being that you will always have that teacher there for yourself, a student will not get the same learning skills as they wold in a class setting.

Overall parents and students should communicate within themselves to see which area would be best for their students. When it comes to school and sports there should always be a balance and not one way out. Online school might be tempting to take, but there's nothing better than taking classes in a school. There are also many source if you are having trouble rather that would be with online databases or teacher/student help. There is always a better way to strengthen your education. Taking courses in school is the way to go. Be ready to see your friends and teachers in person everyday! ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5C7AF7C12082,"To become a lawyer you have to take the LSAT test, at Towson University 35% of the people who took online classes failed the LSAT. To learn about the obstacles and struggle of the real world, you have to go to school. Going to school will be a very hard time but it will prepare you for your life after school. Going to school gives you a lot of benefits that include communication skills, and will give you relationships with friends and teachers.

Going to school gives you communication skills and relationships that you will need in the future. Giannis Antetekumpu, a NBA player from Greece dropped out of high school in Greece and wanted to work. Giannis had a great relationship with one of the teachers, that teacher made Giannis go to school again and play basketball, than he became a MVP in the NBA because of that teacher. At Towson University people 30% of the people who took the LSAT

from studying online failed because there was no communication, and first hand learning. 70% of the people who took the test while attending school passed. This shows that going to school gives you those relationships and communication skills that is needed to be well off in the future.

Going to school will get you a far in life, and will get you through a lot of the obstacles that you go through. I go through anxiety, because I go to school though being around all these people taught me how to fight the anxiety. Whenever I would feel nervous or intense I know that I can get through it. If I did school at home, I would have never taught my self how to go through that because I would not have that communication and in school life to help me adapt to it. In the show the Fosters,

Aiden homosexual in the show did not go to school for three weeks because he was scared, but when he went to school everyone clapped for him and showed him that he was loved. It is amazing because some people do not feel as loved at home, but in school they feel loved.

When you are in school you feel loved, you gain social skills, and grow relationships. Although people say that online school is better so you don't get bullied, but there should not be bullies in your school in the first place. When you are at school you feel loved and meet new people that will help you out through your whole life. Communication skills and relationships is important with whatever you want to do in your life, and will help you through obstacles you will go through. Being in school is very impactful, and has a lot of benefits.                           ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5690C4B1DE7E,"As modern technology progresses, more and more of our everyday activities are shifting from manual and on-paper activities to automated online functions. A key example of this in modern society is something as normal as email. In the past, people communicated via letters which had to be mailed to each other, taking weeks to deliver;

however, the modern day email technology allows us to deliver messages to others in seconds. As we progress further and further into the future, more and more of these essential daily activities transfers from manual/ in person contact, to automated and online activities. The next major milestone of this online revolution is to make digital and online education and teaching more wide scale so that every student and school can benefit. Many schools have began to offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Student's will greatly benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are not comfortable or focused at school to work diligently from an undisturbed and comfortable situation from their homes, it allows for more feasible scheduling situations, and allows students to be more organized thus resulting in better quality work.

Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are not comfortable or focused at school to work diligently from an undisturbed and comfortable situation at their homes. A person's workplace means so much to their work efficiency and quality. Many people often find this comfortable and safe space within the constraints of their own homes. Working from home brings in a couple essential factors, that a lot of times are hard to find at schools which range from comfort, focus, and familiarity. One basic aspect that is often pointed to when talking about comfort at school versus comfort at home is the amount of noise pollution. While at school, you are often surrounded by twenty five to thirty other students who are all chatting and creating noise pollution in your work environment. However, while working at home, there is rarely any noise pollution because of the vastly lesser amount of people in your work environment. This more focused and comfortable work environment can allow students to strive and gain success rather then be out of concentration and disturbed at a school.

Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students to follow and create a more feasible and flexible schedule. Many students in high school participate in a variety of after-school activities and hobbies; however, since school takes away so much of the normal student's day including commute to and from school, it is often hard to schedule and plan all these essential activities and hobbies. Personally, I partake in a major robotics and STEM club known as FTC. At FTC we retain extremely knowledgeful information about creating, programming, and experimenting robotic designs which we compete at competitions using. One of my major struggles is balancing school and FTC because I have to go to school for seven to eight hours and then find space for time to commit to FTC as well as finish my studying and homework. Allowing students like myself to attend classes from home through online or video conferences would be extremely beneficial to the way I schedule my everyday activities because digital schooling would cut out essential time-consuming factors such as commute time and block switching thus providing me with more time to dedicate to my hobbies and extra-curricular activities.

Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students to be much more organized through digital tools and resources. Attending school in person often means you will receive a tremendous amount of hard-copy and paper handouts. However, digital schooling and online schooling often uses digital copies of these handouts and online resources such as Google classroom and Google drive. The various resources allow the everyday student to be exponentially more organized as rather then creating countless physical folders and carrying around hundreds of papers, you can simply have access to everything you need from the touch of your phone screen. Digital education also allows students who have trouble asking their teachers questions in person while in front of many other students to articulate themselves personally to their teachers without being seen by their classmates through several available functions that come available with digital educating.

Online education from home and teaching through video conferences and other online tools can greatly advance teaching and education as it allows students to learn in a comfortable environment, allows students to maintain feasible and flexible schedules, and allows students to have a much more organized education. Currently, we are heading in a path were all aspects of our daily life are being digitized and improved through online functions. Our education and learning is only the next aspect to make that leap to the future!",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
A4EECC69CA30,"Online school really sounds great, but is it really. Many people believe that taking classes from home is beneficial, but I think otherwise. Some may argue that you can get better rest and not have as much stress whihc are good things, but overall I think it is not a good idea. Most kids in school learn much better face to face with a teacher and not online. I have taken one class online for spanish in middle school to help me lern more and preform at the best of my ability, but I found myself losin focus. One of the biggest parts of school is the physical interaction with other people and online classes can not provide that for you. Classes at home would take away the social part of school, distract students from learning, and doesn't give you the chance to play sports at your High School.

Being social is one of the most important parts of school and society in general. Everyday I am excited to go to school to talk to my friends or even meet new friends. Taking classes from you room would completely diminish social interaction with kids. My latin class had none of my friends in it with me, which forced me to talk to new people and make friends. I became friends with people I wouldn't think of talking to our getting to know better. One of my sisters friends from middle school was home schooled up until the 8th grade. She seemed very different than all of the other kids in which she wasn't very social and didn't talk much. This is an example of how having classes at home can completely change a kids life for the worse. I went to a very small school from elementary school to the end of middle schooland knew every single person that went there. Making the switch to Generic_School was one of the biggest things I've ever had to do. From a class of 40 students to a class of 500 and going from 8 classes a day to 4 classes rotating off every day was a huge change for me. Making new friends took awhile, but all of these things helped me adapt and learn a lot about how I had to change and apply myself differently.

If I had to do online school I would barely get any work done. All of the distractions at my house would take me away from my work and not allow me to get anything done. At school there are very few distractions. We talk to eachother and go on our phones, but still we learn and pay attention in class. At home I would wake up late every morning, play video games, and have no motivation at all to get any work done online. Teachers watch over their students while they are taking test so they can't cheat on them, while at home every single student would be getting 100% on every assignment because nobody can stop them from cheating. That would stop everyone from learning the information because there is no need to study when the answers are sittting right infront of you. A girl who used to play on my team was homeschooled and would barely talk to use about anything. When we asked her about home schooling she said would get great grades on everything since it was online and she could just find the answers infront of her. Nobody understood since we were young and weren't homeschooled.

Playing sports at Generic_School is one of my favorite things to do. Trying out for soccer and making the team has given me the chance to become a better player and meet some of my best friends. If I were to be at home taking classes I wouldn't have the chance to even meet them or get better. Sophmore year I was terrified to tryout because I didn't know anyone on the team. From my perspective I thought I wasn't good enough for the team and they didn't need me. After I made the team I felt very welcomed to the squad by everyone and shortly became great friends with all of them. Taking classes takes all of these priviledges away from kids. Sports at school help you bond and gain teamwork skills that online school can't offer you. Online school can't teach you about being social or having teamwork and that is what I think school is all about.

Online classes would ruin my school experience by allowing kids to cheat and not learn the material, taking about sports, and not being able to socialize and make friends in your classes. The great thing about school is that you never know what friends will be in your class, or if you are going to have to make new friends. High School always prepares you for he real world without you even knowing. I have learned how to interact with adults and other students while being polite and using manners. With online school you wouldn't get the opportunities that school provides you. Online school may have its benefits, but I believe the weaknesses outweigh them.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
6FE142AE1BD0,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to take classes from home?

I believe that if students had to make the decision to take classes online or come to school, they would most likely pick school but personally i'd be the one taking the online classes. Besides some of the teens nowadays would recommend online, but then again the middle school and below would rather be at school because they are younger and into school while teens prefer to be at work or hanging out with an friend. Therefore that opportunity would have defiantly been token advantage of well by the teens. Because the younger kids arent really to worried about being home or hanging out because all of there friends and fun are at school not at home.

In my opinion, high school should be online classes only; Because at this point if you look at the results on how many children actually come to school when theyre in high school vs when theyre in middle school/elementary it would be a big difference in attendance records. everyone would literally be passing because its online an you dont have to come to school you can literally lay in your bed and do your work. Besides your gonna have a lot of time on your hands because your not in a school you dont have to switch classes, eat lunch, go to the locker, class changes none of that so you have a lot of time to complete all of your work.

So therefore if my school offered online classes, that would be greatly token advantage of by me and most of the students that go here. The teachers wouldnt even have worry about the work not getting done. Because you have so much time on your hands to get the work done you cant even complain or fail and if you do your just not trying at all and must not care if you graduate or not, And thats not good you should want to graduate no matter what it takes. Online classes are very recommended by most students so if you believe online classes should be offered to your school speak up maybe my essay could help you out.!                   ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
53C9F177EB03,"In the modern age, computers are becoming more and more common in a household. In order to adapt, schools are now offering ""distance learning""; learning that is tailored to ones needs through the usage of video conferencing and online courses. I believe distance learning would benefit students immensely, as it allows the student to focus on their schoolwork in the comfort of their own home, it is a cheaper alternative for both the school and the student, and it would save valuable time for the student.

Distance learning, as the name suggests, is done from a distance. The student learns from the comfort of their home, and benefits from personalized time with a teacher. When at school, students are distracted with other items such as friends, activities, and perhaps even relationships. When in the comfort of their own home, however, they they can easily focus on their schoolwork with no distractions present. Since there are no other students present, students can benefit from personalized time with a teacher; the teacher has no other students except that one student. Video conferencing benefits the student immensely, because, when in the comfort of their home, they can converse with the teacher and have an easier learning experience.

Distance learning is also cheaper; rather than have the county spend money on gas for transportation for the student, or have the teachers spend money on books and other classroom items, schools can save that money with distance learning. It is a cheaper alternative, not just for the school, but for the student as well. The student would not have to spend money on textbooks; everything would be online. Distance learning is a cheaper alternative for everybody, and would benefit both parties; not just one. By attending classes from home, the student will be able to learn more effectively and for less money.

Distance learning saves time; rather than having to wake up at some cursed time, rushing to catch the bus, and hopping on at the last minute, you can hop out of bed and onto your computer. Distance learning saves time for the student, as it gets rid of the need to go the distance to learn; rather, distance learning offers the student the opportunity to learn from a distance, ensuring that distance should not have an effect on the student's learning. Distance learning also offers the teachers the chance to save time. The teachers, rather than going to school, can also stay at home and conference with the student. This eliminates the need to go to a physical place; it saves tons of time. Distance learning not only saves time for the student, but for the teachers as well.

It can be said, without a doubt, that distance learning is very beneficial to the student. Students get to learn from the comfort of their own home, they save money, and they save time. There are no needless distractions, nor is there any extra costs concerning them. Distance learning would benefit many students, as it allows them to have a personalized learning experience; a one-on-one with the teachers. In the future, distance learning should be offered at schools everywhere, as it will bring a new age in America that will ultimately benefit the youth of our nation. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9EE9B4AAF84F,"Students have been going to school for hundreds of years, but now with the introduction of new technology, there are other methods of learning. Online and video conferencing is a more recent form of learning due to new computers, tablets, phones etc. Students can be greatly benefited by the ability to do online schooling because they can work at their own pace, they have more time to participate in extracurricular activities, and have more time to be with family and friends.

In high school, students have to attend school for 4 blocks, each an hour and a half, combined with lunch, approximately 30 minutes, and homeroom which is approximately 45 minutes. School starts at 9:10 and ends at 3:58, which is approximately eight hours. The amount of time actually needed to complete my work is much lower than eight hours. I could complete all my work in two to three hours, and be done for the day. This gives me flexibility in my day, allowing me to do other things and complete my work when I please. Say some students need more time to complete their work; they have all day to complete their work. Also, a big problem many students face when going to school is distractions because they see all their friends. Students spend a majority of class goofing off because they have class with their best friends, and it's hard to concentrate. Having the ability of online school can eliminate this problem, giving students the peace and privacy to learn.

A large majority of high school students participate in extracurricular activities such as sports, jobs, and clubs, but have little time to do all of them because school gets out so late. By the time school gets out, students need to complete their homework, help out their family, eat dinner, and then maybe have enough time to play a sport. With the ability to work at your own pace with online schooling, there is much more free time to have a job, play a sport, or join a club. Furthermore, a lot of students have to work a job to help support their families or save up to go to college; not all students have the luxury of having everything paid for. With online schooling, students can finish up their work quick and have to rest of the day to work and help support the family or save up for college. With having to go to school for eight hours, students are tired when they get home and don't feel that it's necessary to work out and get exercise. Less and less kids are going outside or playing a sport because they want to relax after a long day of school. This could all change with online schooling because school could be much shorter and they will have a lot of energy to want to exercise and get into shape.

Lastly, with online schooling, students will have more time to spend with the people who matter most, their family and friends. Students aren't spending enough time with their family and friends because they have to balance school, sports, and jobs. This could all change because they could get their work done in the morning, exercise, go to work, and have the rest of the evening to spend with whoever you choose. Life is meaningless if you don't get to enjoy it with people who make you happy. People have finite time on this earth, and if they are spending the first 20 or so years of it doing school work instead of enjoying meaningful time with their friends and family. Don't get me wrong, school work is very important, but school work isn't needed for eight hours a day.

Although with more time on their hands, kids can cause more trouble in their town, students could still cause trouble no matter what. The small portion of kids doing drugs, stealing, and being mischievous isn't worth not giving students an advantage of being able to work from home with online schooling. Kids will still do illegal things and cause trouble no matter if they are going to school or working from home. You can't punish all students for the small amount of kids who are participating in illegal matters and getting into trouble. Most students will take advantage of online schooling and use it to work at their own pace, participate in extracurricular activities, and spend time with their family and friends.

All in all, online schooling is a huge benefit to students because it allows students to work at their own pace, participate in extracurricular activities, and spend more time with family and friends. I strongly encourage school boards around the United States to contemplate switching school curriculum to online schooling.        ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
0A7EE102DFCB,"Some schools offering online classes is a great thing. This lets students attend online classes or even a whole course from home, be able to go over material when traveling, improve with classes that are more difficult. The idea of schools nationwide doing this a very popular now with this generation of students.

Having classes you can take on the go is very convenient for the people taking them. If a students is going away on a trip then online classes offers a chance to catch up on school when having downtime. Being in a hotel at night with nothing better to do, why not watch a class before bed. Some people enjoy traveling long distances, however, being completely taken away from school can hurt anybodies' grade. Being able to catch up before coming back to school, its like you never left.

Students that want to take a lot of classes often take online classes. It shortens the school day by allowing them to go home and enjoy it that way. Adding a hard class you take in school to online it really lightens the load and allow the student to get more done in a shorter amount of time.

Classes that are difficult can be more simple when taken online. Being able to stop a teacher to write notes or to Google something that doesn't make sense to better understand it. Using this for math classes would be much easier not having to rush before the teacher moves on. Being able to pause a class is a good way to stay top of it, the things that could be done to help the student are limitless.

Reasons like these are why schools everywhere should offer online classes. Students find this more convenient and easier, while simultaniously academically improving. Overall online classes are definitely beneficial to students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
52FF7CE735BE,"First I think so because of the fact that people foccuse more on there friends then they do on there school work. Next i think not because some people are better hands on then working on there computers. Then I think so because of the fact that people don't like to come to school because there parents let them do what they want to do and they don't care how much work they have missed. Lastly I think so because of kids like to fight and mess up in class and get in trouble and miss out on school so they would be better at home.

First, people foccus to much about there friends then there school work,then they don't know what to do when a teacher ask them to do some then they be looking stupid in the face. Becuase they play around,and then when the time come to take a test or some there friends will pass but you won't .So you will be left behind and your friends won't be there for you to help you pass. They will sit there and laugh in your face like your dumb. But see if you at home and don't have nobody to mess you up or make you loss your foccuse you'll pass. Then at the end of the day you'll be up to grade with your friends and you dont have to worry about people laughing at you because you didn't pass your test. Last people thats say there your friends they really not your friends they just want to see you do bad,then when they pass they not going to care if you left behind they just going to keep going on with out you at the end of the day.

So thats why i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
A6D10284A4DD,"In the new age of online technology many people have seen improvements in all aspects of life. Within most school systems there has been an increase in technology around the schools, and some school systems take it a step further and allow students and teachers to use technology to complete work at home and outside of school. Many students may choose to take online courses if they arent able to attend a school in their area. However, some people say that taking online courses at home increases distractions and work would take longer to be completed. If more students started to take online classes then they could avoid major distractions at school, finish class assignments on a schedule best for them, and as they learn, they will have a teacher working specifically with them so they can get help in all areas necessary.

When comparing online classes to classes at school, one big issue that schools face are the many distractions in their buildings. For most schools there are usually distractions within the classes, hallways, and other areas. This can negatively effect any student that is attempting to enhance their knowledge of their subjects. Health is also an issue that prevents students from completing their assignments, mental and physical health can prohibit many students from doing their best in school or even attending school at all. Online school offers that opportunity to complete their work when it is best for them to complete it. Although some people may say this can be prevented but, mental health is an issue many students may experience, and if they had to go to an environment that influence them to feel malnourished mentally then online courses may help them complete their work.

Online classes also can provide a more flexible schedule for all students. In the collegiate level many students may have heavy schedules filled with work, sports, and even family. Online classes provide an opportunity for students to find a balance by allowing students to complete their classwork on hours that best fit them. Online classes also provide an opportunity to prevent a student from misunderstanding what their teacher is trying to teach to them, the classes are one on one experiences for every student to be able to understand. The flexibility that online classes are able to provide are beneficial for both students and teachers, teachers can pre-teach almost all of their lessons and have their students learn them at their own pace. A down side to this is the fact that some students just will not complete the work they are assigned, or they will procrastinate for as long as they are able to

These advantages to online courses will benefit all students who elect to enroll in the courses. The ideas that online classes will decrease distraction to students, it will allow them to complete their work one a schedule to best fit them and that one on one teaching will be best for all students are true. Online classes are a great alternative to regular classroom courses and should be introduced in more and more school systems.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
CC0AC8356D9E,"Imagine taking classes at home. It would feel so much easier, me knowing from being a student, taking classes at home could bring lots of benefits. If schools were to offer long distance learning classes via online or video conference, the student would feel less pressure, stress, and actually a little motivated to complete the course. Today in the modern world, we have unbelievable technology so why not use it for school or to learn in general ? It would really take weight off of the students shoulders to take classes at home instead of traveling or going to a building filled with other students to recieve said classes.

One good benefit online classes bring students is that its online. Students will not have to travel all the way to a different state away from home just to take one class. Some might prefer to have an expierience of going to collage or making memories; However, there are those who much rather take the class online instad of leaving their home. Many students struggle with money at times so online classes is a major benefit and could help them save a ton of money by not traveling. Who knows when there could be traffic getting to school ? Arriving late at school is never good for students but that will not be a problem if we take onlne courses at home.

Main reasons students get up to go to school is because they either want to graduate to make their parents happy or they have something important to do that day. Students really dislike school, especially the fact of having to wake up bright and early in the morning. We need the energy and motivation to get up and complete whatever needs to be completed. If we go to sleep knowing we could just wake up and take an online class instead of going somewhere to recieve it, it will help us majorly. It would be much easier to knock out a class at home and then going about the rest of your day. Education online at home would give us the benefit of better motivation and the thriving feeling of completeing the class;furthermore, being at home gives us good energy because we are in a place we do not mind being in.

A really good benefit from online classes is the balance it could bring to our every day lives. A student taking online classes can manage their time,work,family and personal appointmetns more than a student actually going to school can. Being at school can really take a big chunk of time out of your day and leave you with no time for your own life. When taking an online class you wont have to worry about getting home to get dressed becuase you're already at home !

How we manage our time is very important because it is how we live. I am sure the majority of students really dislike spending time at school even the most dedicated students. Online classes at home would benefit us with a good feeling of our time spending. Students at home are far more happier and productive. Mind you, that being at home can cuase a student to be a little drousy but;nevertheless, students wake up way faster at home then in a school building with people they do not even like. Online classes helps us with time and balance with our lives in the real world.

Online classes, in my opinion, bring many more benefits to students. It takes major stress and anxiety of our backs. The feeling of just being at home taking a class that is required or beneficial to have or take gives us the power to finish it. We all have our own lives and the ability to live it how we please. I would not take school or classes at all but if it were to be required, online classes would be my choice. It is really beneficial and it is almost certain we will see advancements in the future for online schooling. It is crazy how far we have come from past years, all the benefits we have now such as online courses for school, can really come in as a life savor of one who has his or hers family to look out for. There is always a choice in life and no matter what it is, it will have its own benefits and doubts, its just up to us on what we make out of it.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
FDD398F4D5E9,"Does the study environment really affect students to study knowledge? There is a lot of people be success from the slum. When they are in the school period, They don't have much modern equipment for them to use, and also do not have a experience teacher to teach them, but they are success finally. I think the environment are not important for students study, as long as you are a hard working student and always pay attention when teacher is talking, you will be the next success person in this world. So for students attend classes in home or in school, it means same things, it's all depend on which students. It doesn't matter in which place or environment, a good student are never make himself fall. So I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

First of all, if students are attend classes from home, I think the students can be more focus on their class, because no one can distracting you, It is impossible. You can only sit on your chair in your room, and then put all of your attention on your online class. For this scene I can make a example, you are just wake up in your bed, and your parent are already go to work. Then, watch the clock, you remind that today is still a school day, and it's the timing for you to open your computer and go to the online class to study. Next, let's image, the house is almost empty except you, no one can talk to you, only the quiet air fill the house. In this moment, you hear the sounds from the computer, yep, it's Generic_Name! Generic_Name is a good math teacher, he is always coming on time, you really love him. After the several hours, he is teach all of the students who is on the online class to solve some math questions. That's the scene will happen I believe if the students are attend online classes from home. No one can distract you and you can focus the class.

Second, if students are attend classes from home, it can reduce a lot of time from the move, like some students may walk to school or some may get bus go to the school, it both takes much time. So reduce time is very important for students. For a example, as a student, I feel so tired when I was wake up on 7:00 am in every morning. And then, get the bus go to school. When bus arrive to school, I still have to waiting until the first period start, yup, 8:10 am. It cost 1 hour from when I wake up to the first period start. So on the other hand, let's try the way on online class, I can wake up around the 7:55 am, 15 minute is enough for me to do something like wash tooth and face etc, It reduce 55 minute. Recently, I saw a data report from the internet, it shows young teens at least need to have 8 hour for sleep everyday. For me, I think 9 hour is better, so I care about that 55 minute, it can make me feel more energy in morning. So if you are the students like me, and your school have the online classes option open, don't worry and stop wasting your time, just apply for it, trust me you will not feel regret for this decision in the future.

Third, if students are attend classes from home, then you will not have to worry about the food. For my personal experience, many students will feel hungry when they are in school, because the lunch time is too late, study knowledge are steal too much energy from our body. So if we are attend class in our home, we can eat anything we want in anytime, even is science class. Also, I think the lunch in school is not that health as we think, especially for some fat people although I not. I always believe if the food is cooking by myself or my parent is more delicious and health, because we know which food is good for us, we know some small detail that they don't know, like what source should add to this food, or what kind of meat is my favorite etc. That's home, the other place can't beyond it. So if you are the students really love the food that making by yourself or you are the students often feel hungry in the class, just apply for the online classes, you will know the feeling when you are eating the food while focus to teacher, its like you're stand in heaven.

In conclusion, above is the reason why I think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Many people know that study knowledge is the most important things for everyone, it doesn't matter in where. But if we have the free to choose the places, we can choose the place that we are more comfortable with. So if you are the students love to sleep more longer, love the food is cook by yourself, or you are the students hate other to distract you. Then, you can consider to apply online classes, there is still have the unlimited benefit that I didn't show you. When you are really attend online classes, those benefit will become the surprise to you. Last, As long as you are work hard, be serious to every work, kind to others, the gold are always shiny, no matter it is stand under floor or on top of a building.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BEDEBC52CD1A,"Does it benefit students more to do online school then actually going to school? Would they get the resources need to complete all of the missing assignments? How would they learn the materials? These are questions that parents and students might ask themselves when having to do this. Today I'm going to give you some reasons on why I think that it is more beneficial of having an online options of doing school work.

First, thing that comes to my mind of it being more beneficial and effective is that if they say they miss school then they could just do the they work that they missed online. Not everyone is able to learn the same way or pick up the material like other students can. One way is by having that online access or video conference option available to them, so that way they can either learn what they missed or they can relearn what they don't understand. By doing this students can learn what they know and didn't know in and out of class if they missed school due to being sick. Even in some cases when a student is sick some teachers don't give the students the option to make up their missed work or assignments when they come back, and by doing that they are far behind than the rest of their classmates, but by having the online option available to them they won't be that far behind.

Next, is that in some cases when students miss school it's probably because of sickness reasons. When it comes down to that not many kids are able going to be able to control or know how many days they are going to be missing because of their sickness. With having all of that plus missing school its going to be hard to catch up. Giving them the resources they need to complete the missing work or to catch up. Video conferences can not only help students, but teach them as well it show either a recorded or live video of the teacher teaching the materials of that topic or unit at homes so that way when they go back to school then they are all caught up. It saves not only teachers, but also their classmates times when learning new material, because they don't have to go back and reteach it.

It still could bring some concerns. One could be they don't have the access to receive it. However that is true in all it does save everyone a lot more time in class to be learning new materials if they did give them that option. A way they could fix it is that they could email their parents the work of what they are missing and they could print it out or go to their local library and work on it their. It just help and benefits them more if we have them the options of it online or through a video conference. Just by allowing those options available to them would help out in a big way.

All in all I think that if students miss school that it would be more beneficial if they could do online school or have a video conference, so that way teachers don't have to go back and reteach the materials again, and that students won't be so far behind from their classmates when they do go back to school. Those are just some reason on why I think its more beneficial to give students the option on doing it online or having a video conference options.      ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8793444EF088,"Millions of people attend school everyday all around the World. Many of these people attend classes at public schools rather than taking classes online because people feel as though classes at public school are a better option and are more beneficial. However, online classes provide the same learning curriculum and information as public schools do. The only major difference between the two class options are that online cclasses allow people to take classes from home. Taking classes from home allows for students to experience the benefits of working in a more comfortable setting, increases their ability to focus, and teaches the importance of responsibility.

In order for students to work productively they need to be within a comfortable environment. Online classes allows for students to experience this. For Example, Generic_Name took Biology online from home for his 1st semester and he always turned in his work on time and always finished his work within 30 minutes to an hour, but Generic_Name's shy friend Generic_Name who didn't take the class online and went to school hardly turned in his work on time and was always slacking off. Generic_Name being able to independently work from home in a comfortable setting allowed him to work in a efficient manor. When students are uncomfortable in the environment they can't work productively because they don't feel comfortable. Without being comfortable in situations students constantly get sidetracked and can't get work done because they may feel as though they are being judged or face issues of uncertainty. Another example is Generic_Name took Algebra 2 online from home her Sophomore year in High School and always knew what she was doing and how to solve the mathematical equations properly, however her boyfriend Generic_Name who took the class at school struggled with finishing his work and keeping a good grade in the class. Generic_Name having the ability to do her work in her bed and being comfortable while she did her work allowed for her to complete her work. Without comfort students struggle to process certain criteria because they aren't relaxed and can't comprehend material that is given to them because they will focus on the fat that they are uncomfortable. Students must feel as though they are in a calming environment in order to work efficiently.

Students are only able to truly focus when they aren't distracted by others. Online classes decrease the vast amount of distractions that public schooling classes have. For Instance, Generic_Name has a project in her AP Environmental Science class online that is due in 3 weeks so as soon as she gets the assignment she starts to work on the project, on the other hand Generic_Name's friend Generic_Name who takes the same class in school and received the same project didn't even think to look at the paper because she decided to talk to people in her class instead. Generic_Name doesn't experience the distractions that Generic_Name does because Generic_Name takes the class by herself and doesn't have to deal with multiple people left and right. When students are away from constant distractions they have the ability to truly focus on the task at hand. Another instance is Generic_Name has to read 20 pages everyday for his AP Literature class and always succeeds to do so, yet his friend Generic_Name who takes the book at school and has time to read in class consistently fails to read the assigned work because he is always staring at a girl in his class. With Generic_Name taking the class from home and not having to deal with being distracted by a girl he thinks is pretty all the time allows for him to stay on task and pay attention. Students can easily experience concentration issues when they are surrounded by multiple people rather than just being by themselves because the mind tends to wonder when in a environment of multiple people. In order for students to remain on task they can't be within an environment that distracts them.

When doing a task on one's own terms they learn how to be responsible. Online classes teach students that it is their personal responsibility to complete tasks given to them. One example is Generic_Name had was taking Spanish online from home and his teacher doesn't send out emails of when the assignments need to be completed, but his girlfriend Generic_Name who takes his class at school always gets reminders during class when the assignments are due. Generic_Name has to consistently check for work himself rather than always relying on his teacher to tell him. Generic_Name's online teacher doing this will allow students to learn that they are responsible for knowing what and when assignments are due. Another example is Generic_Name was doing work online from home and was notified once online that in one week before that his exam was coming up and had to study for the test, yet his friend Generic_Name who attended school and took the same class and had the same teacher was informed 3 times during the week before the exam that he had to study before the exam. Without daily meetings with teachers the students have to take the initiative to follow the instructions they are given. If the instructions aren't followed it is on the student that they had not been active online and payed attention when the information was provided.

Overall online classes can be very helpful to students and their learning processes. Online classes allow for students to feel comfortable while learning, pay more attention to information, and realize that they must keep up with assignments given. Students have the ability to feel more comfortable and complete their work when they take classes at home rather than taking classes in school. Online classes can also help decrease the number of issues that may take attention away from the given tasks. These classes also allow for students to learn that they have the duty to keep themselves informed and that they can't rely on others for work. Ultimately online classes are an excellent option for students to take and students should consider the multiple benefits that come with taking classes from home. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

9FAF37ACBFD7,"Education is becoming increasingly reliant on technology.

Classroom activities are now more dependent on the internet and some college entrance exams are embarking on the switch to digital.

With new innovations flooding the market, some schools are considering offering students the opportunity to use video conferencing as a substitute for attending school.

Students would not benefit from being able to take classes from home because of the communication difficulties and the lack of social opportunities video conferencing brings.

Students learning through online conferencing would experience more difficulties in communication than students who physically attend school.

Since video conferencing relies on the internet, there are many more factors that could go wrong.

Power or internet outages could cancel classes for days.

Teachers would have to go through extra training to teach online classes.

Problems with the conferencing program could leave students stranded.

And finally, teachers could experience difficulties with using the software.

While physically attending school is dependent on the weather, there are fewer variables to worry about and fewer things that can go wrong.

Ultimately, video conferencing is much more complicated and error prone than physically attending school.

While academics are the reason for attending school, social opportunities at school are also important.

One who would be able to take classes from home would not have an opportunity to interact with peers and would have a harder time joining clubs or other activities.

It is important that students develop social skills, and if students do not gain experiences of collaborating with others, then it will be harder for students to adjust later on in college or in the workforce.

Furthermore, it would be much harder for students to build a friend group and have a support network they can rely on, potentially leading to a prevalence of mental health issues such as depression.

High School is meant to be a period of both academic and social growth, and it is important that students learn needed social skills so they will not have to learn them later.

With new technology tools intended to bolster education becoming readily available, some educational facilities are considering the switch to online learning methods, such as video conferencing.

Some may argue that online conferencing helps increase availability of education, but the costs would outweigh the benefits.

While education might become more widespread, the overall quality of education would drop sharply and students would lose the social aspect of learning.

The ability to take classes from home would be detrimental due to the communication struggles and fewer social opportunities online conferencing brings.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
D5164250EE9D,"Some students who tend to make it into college are the ones who take online classes at home. Students who take online classes are more likely to receive a great amount of knowledge. Young adults can learn more by having a private class with an online instructor rather than an actual teacher. This way , the online instructor can answer any questions the student may have about a specific topic. Students should attend classes at home in order for them to gain the extra knowledge they may need.

While some students prefer going to school for up to 8 hours a day, others like the idea of staying home while they take their online classes. This can give students more free time throughout the day. In other words, this can give students the freedom to spend more time with their family members or work on a special hobby of theirs. Taking classes at home rather than at school, can also be very helpful to some who have full time jobs. In this case, students who have full time jobs can work and can get the education they need.

Despite the fact that staying at home all the time can be a bit boring, students who take online classes at home can still benefit in tremendous ways. For instance, students who take online classes from home can benefit by focusing without any distractions. Students who often have private sessions with online teachers, can benefit and gain more knowledge by asking various questions without any hesitation. On the other hand, students who do not take online classes at home, will tend to hesitate when it comes to asking questions in front of many people. By asking questions, students can expand their knowledge and benefit from it later on.

Although students who take classes online can achieve more, they can also become responsible and independent. For example, students will become more responsible when it comes to submitting their work on time. This way, they will feel proud of themselves and continue doing outstanding work. Students taking classes online can benefit and become independent when it comes to multitasking. In this case, students can work on many objectives without any hassle.

In conclusion, students would gain more knowledge and benefit if they take online classes. Online teachers are a great help for students who are taking online classes. For example, they can help students with: projects, assignments and homework. Students should take online classes because it can help them gain valuable skills and boost their knowledge. Attending classes online from home can give the student the freedom to: have a full time job, get the education they need and expand their knowledge.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
01B3A57AB13D,"The advancement of technology has allowed for the development of mass communication and the globalization of information that continues to revolutionize modern society. During this modern age, society revolves around technological innovation which brings up the question of whether digitally advancing the education system to better replicate the technological world is in actuality beneficial to students. The educational curriculum that incorporates virtual courses is providing a beneficial opportunity because students won't miss classes due to environmental or structural school issues, they would save a lot of money, and their schedule would be more flexible to account for non-academic opportunities in life.

Firstly, the primary reasons why schools get canceled and have to plan extra days within the school year is because of the fear of dangerous weather conditions that threatens the safety of the student body. One of the main weather conditions that causes schools to cancel is heavy snow where ice would form on sidewalks and roads which creates hazardous conditions for students who walk to school and for school buses to drive on. The solution for weather cancellation issues is distance learning because students would benefit from having easy access to a mentor who would continue to educate them through the Internet while they are safely at home. Another external issue that can cause harm or cancel school for students is when schools are under reconstruction which creates distractions and hazardous areas within the school that can threaten the safety of the student body. Video conferencing would allow students to simply learn within the peaceful and safe environment of their home without without the fear of being injured or interrupted. Online courses ensures that students' learning process won't be delayed due to external factors to guarantee that students are properly prepared for final exams during the end of the school year.

Secondly, students would benefit greatly from attending classes at home because they would save a lot money on transportation and on school lunch fees. School expenses would overall be reduced if students are able to attend online classes because some students face the unfortunate circumstance of not having a school bus assigned to their specific neighborhood which means that their parents' car mileage and car fuel are being rapidly used up in order for them to have a source of transportation to school. Online classes, in contrast, would simply require students to walk to a quiet environment within their home to ensure that they can maintain a focused mindset that is ready to learn through either reading an online textbook or participating in a video conference. Another expense when attending a physical school are the school lunches which are priced from one to five dollars depending on the county or school system and can accumulate to an enormous amount of money for middle class students who eat school lunches everyday. Distance learning, on the other hand, would allow students the ability to eat at home without the need for their parents to pay additional fees and students with a variety of health issues or allergies can also control the ingredients of the foods they are consuming to ensure that they are not deteriorating their health. Contrary to what many believes, distance learning courses are beneficial for students whose family are on a budget because the affordability of online courses surpasses the attendance of a public school when accounting for all the additional taxes and fees that are put onto students who are attending a physical school.

Thirdly, students would have a more flexible schedule that would allow them to account for new job opportunities and volunteering hours. Private and public schools are forcing their students into a regime and strict schedule that takes up the majority of the mornings and afternoons of their students' life which disables them the ability to apply for internships or well paying part time jobs that occur during typical school hours. Online classes would allow students the ability to choose the time for their classes which forces students to practice prioritizing responsibilities and improve on their time management skill. An example of students who mostly work while attending school are college students who have to pay for their attendance and possibly even lodging within the college campus. Virtual classrooms would allow these students to build their work portfolio while also allowing students to return home after work and finish their academic assignments at home during nighttime. Another reason as to why online courses' flexible schedule is beneficial for students is because they would be able to have enough time during daylight hours to volunteer and help give back to their community which builds the morals and social connections with others in the community while also allowing the students to formally engage in academic studies at home after they've finished volunteering. Students would greatly benefit from online classes where a flexible schedule will allow students to have more time to engage in different experiences in life and formulate a more balanced lifestyle that isn't fully revolved around academics.

In conclusion, distance learning is beneficial for students where it ensures that the students' education isn't hindered by uncontrollable weather conditions and it helps ease financial stress that low income and middle class families experience in a capitalist society. But most importantly, it allows students to have more independence which builds their character and further prepares them for the adult world where they are gradually gaining new responsibilities and experiences in life which they wouldn't be capable of experiencing without the flexible schedule that online courses allow. Virtual education is both effective and beneficial for the rising digital youths of America. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
2B4218A99969,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools are becoming more technological by using technology as a way for students to learn. Online or video conferencing to could be a excellent idea for these reasons students can be under the whether, more practice on a subject, and there could be no way to get to school.

Firstly, online or video conferencing classes is a good idea is because a student could be under the whether. Many students get sick and don't come to school,so they miss a lot of work. With online classes a student can do their work from home and when they go to school they would be all caught up. For example, I used to miss a lot of days at school because I was sick. When I came back to school I was confused on what was going on in class, so if there were an online class it would have really help me out. Online classes or video conferencing could help if you had to be in the hospital for a few days you could still catch up on all your school work.

Secondly, online or video conferencing classes is a good idea is because a student could get more practice on a subject that he or she was struggling on. Many students are struggling on a subject and just don't ask for help. With online or video conferencing classes could get more one on one time with the teacher for help. For example, I need help with math and can't stay after school to get help because I ride the bus. I could use video conferencing to get the teacher help.

Thirdly, online or video conferencing is a good idea is because a student may not have a way to get to school. Many students ride the bus because their parents can't take them to school. For example, I wake up late and miss the bus instead of stress out over this I could get on the video conference with my class. I see why some people may say online or video conferencing classes is a bad idea, but this why they are wrong because the classes help students learn more productively.

In conclusion, online or video conferencing classes is terrific idea because a student can be sick, allows for students to have more practice, and it allows students to get work done if they don't have a way to school.

2A4221CE52DC,"The future of this world is technology, but how far can technology go? Some schools offer learning outside of the classroom by attending classes from home by going online and video conferencing. Online classes are not beneficial to students when public schooling is accessible. The environment of public school is completely different from home, the pressure in order to become better in public schools is not the same as taking classes online. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because they would cheat, procrastinate, and not make friends easily.

Attending classes from home can easily lead to cheating. Students can cheat on assignments and exams because they have everything they need in their house in order to pass. Books and the internet can both be accessed from home without the teacher knowing the student is cheating. An exam would not show a students learning when they have the ability to access the internet to answer a question they should have learned. Although cheating is already an issue in public schooling, online classes would not lower the rate of cheating. The ability to go on the internet while no one is watching become a huge incentive to cheat. Therefore, public schools are finding ways to minimize cheating in the classroom as well. Public schooling is the best option because cheating would continue to get worse if more kids attend online classes from home.

Procrastination would become a bigger issue if students attended classes from home. Kids would not meet deadlines on time if they were to take online classes. The expectations would be lowered for students who do not turn in, or do, the work. Deadlines to assignments would be pushed back, giving students more time to do what they want to do, and papers would not represent the students capability because they rush to get it done. Having the pressure of a teacher, in person, helps motivate students to complete assignments. A teacher's physical presence helps motivate a student to do well on assignments and ask for help. Students attending classes online can not easily ask for feedback or advice on assignments from a teacher who is not in person. So, online schooling is detrimental to students because procrastination would rise.

Making friends grows difficult when taking classes from home because those students who take online classes are not attending classes with thousands of other students in a public school. Interacting with other people is how humans can gain more friends and become well-rounded. Being versatile can be beneficial in many situations like jobs that require interacting with others on a daily basis, for instance, a lawyer. A lawyer must know how to communicate and persuade the jury to agree with him. Taking online classes forces a student to become an introvert. The only communication the student would have is with the teacher through a computer. Public schools encourage students to make friends and build on experiences. Although this choice allows students to get assignments done when they are not able to attend public school, it would get the work done, but the student would not learn anything.

Public schooling is more beneficial compared to online schooling because students would cheat, procrastinate, and have difficulty making friends. Schools offering learning from a distance by allowing kids to attend classes online is detrimental to a student's success. The environment of public school is completely different from home, the pressure in order to become better in schools is not the same as classes online. Issues in public schools would only rise if students could take classes from home. In conclusion, schools should not offer online schooling from home because the impact is more negative than positive.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school.

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student..

In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face. As a result, there should be teachers and staff at the school, If the student takes classes at the school. Plus, the students will get a better education.

Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better.

Therefore, students should take classes in school. Schools are meant to be for students to learn from all subjects. Taking classes in school would benefit the students. If the students take classes in school, there will be more teachers and staff at the school. Truly, learning from a teacher helps you a lot, because they are teaching you face to face.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
3FCC183CC09B,"Many schools are beginning to challege the common practice of requiring in-person schooling. Some offer students the option to take the same courses at home at their own pace, as opposed to in school and at whatever speed the teacher teaches. For the average student, this is not a good idea to say the least. It gets rid of the social aspect of school, making it significantly more difficult to develop social skills; the lack of having to wake up early and travel somehwere makes them unprepared for higher education and the real world; and while some may need it due to a disability or an unsafe school life, it would be overall harmful for those who just see it as a way to stay home and should not be offered to those types of students.

The biggest aspect of school that makes it different from online schooling is the social interactions that come with it. Throughout school you are put in classes with other students and over time develop skills that help you make friends and become more comfortable talking to, and in front of strangers. By taking classes at home, this is stripped away from the student. They do not get the chance to develop socially and will be massively stunted once they either enter college or get a job. Take a student who wants to do something in finance for example: he belives that the mass amounts of students would only hinder his development in terms of the study of economics. He decides early on that he wants to take online courses and does so for all of High School. He graduates with the same honors as a normal student except when he goes to an interview for the college, he doesn't get in. He wasn't able to complete the interview as he was not comfortable talking to anyone but his parents or prexisting close friends. This pattern happens again when he goes to get a job and while he may have the expertize needed to get the job, he doesn't have the social skills required to flourish. That all could have been avoided if he just took normal High School classes.

As stated in the example before, taking online classes has the potential to hinder your succcess in the real world. By not having any social experience, one would find it difficult to make friends in college as well as later on as an adult. And not only making friends, but just talking to and in front of people in general would be much more difficult if the student has no prior experience of the sort. And it is not only social hinderance that will get in the way of success, it is also a lack of routine similar to that of a typical job. Let's go back to the student for a minute. Say he finds a job straight out of High School and is about to start it. He doesn't know what he is getting into in terms of waking up early and time management in general; he spent his High School years sleeping in, doing the school work in the middle of the day, and staying up late. He isn't going to be prepared for the time management that comes with having a real job. So by taking online classes, you are also missing out on key skills that could be crutial to success later on in life.

Now, for a minute, consider another completely seprate student. He has a diability that makes it very difficult for him to walk, and while at school, he gets bullied for it on a consistent basis. He is in pain constantly from walking around the school, and his mental health is fading because of the consistet tormenting from his peers; he is close to spiraling, but there is a light. He hears about online courses and how he could get all the same education but from the comfort of his home. He seizes the opportunity and starts classes at home; he is slowly but surley getting better and is finally happy. So there is a solid argument to be made for online classes: it can help those who either don't feel comfortable at school for mental health reasons, and it can be beneficial to those with diabilities. In those cases, the offering of online courses is justifiable. But they are courses offered to everyone, and that is where the trouble lies. Students could abuse this power and take the online classes just because they want to stay home, in which case it could be detrimental to their development as a person.

So in conclusion, there are only certain cases where students could benefit from online education. If a student's situation does not fall into those categories, then the student would only suffer from the experience, missing out on social development and other skills that would come in handy later in life. So unless a student has a disability, or just doesn't feel safe or comfortable at school due to a mental disorder or his or her relationship with their peers, under no circumstances should students be allowed to take online corses.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
7999CE056DE6,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This can be very beneficial for a lot of students, maybe even teachers as well. Sitting in a classroom all day can be very hard on students. Something like taking online classes can help students feel more comfortable and free, while it also may even be able to help them learn better with one on one contact.

School is started for kids at a very young age. As years go by, students are at school most days of the year for multiple hours at a time. It can be very draining for students to sit uncomfortably and do work in school all day. This is why taking online classes can be very helpful for a lot students. A big percentage of people are most comfortable when they are at home. Student being able to be comfortable while do their school work can help them out a lot. This also gives them more freedom as far as taking a few possible breaks, going at their own pace and also having a lot more access to personal help.

One on one time is very important with specific needs of students. If help is needed, it would be a lot easier to receive it because the teacher isn't trying to help other students at the same time. Personal contact between a student and a teacher can be very beneficial on both ends. A teacher can find out exactly what the student needs help with and it can also help students learn better. Students may also possibly get a better understanding on the whole topic that they are struggling with. Once the problem is resolved, the teacher can keep working with the student on the next topic.

Some may argue that students should not be able to take online classes or have private video conferences. With a few solid points, this argument is somewhat invalid. One example on this side is distractions. Young kids and teens tend to get distracted very easily by a variety of different things. This includes phones, tablets, television, pets or even other people. The list drags on. As distractions are also an issue in classrooms, students tend to get more distracted if they have more freedom and flexibility with their work. Procrastination is also a big issue. If students have more freedom with their work, they will possibly keep putting it off until the last minute. As this also happens in school, it is easier to procrastinate when you know that the assignment is not due for a little while.

In conclusion, schools should allow online classes and video conferencing for students. Something like taking online classes can help students feel more comfortable and free while it also may even be able to help them learn better with one on one contact. Disregarding a few issues that comes along with this such as procrastination and distractions, students should still be allowed to have access to the extra help and the one on one contact with teachers. In the long run, it will most likely help quite a large number of students in having a good understanding on their school work. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? It would benefit them because they can do they work in their bed, on the road, and they can turn it in whenever they want; No time limit on the work.

Turning in your work whenever you want is amazing. Who wouldn't want to turn in their work in whenever they want. You could be busy all day, maybe all week & still manage to turn your work in late. That benefits a lot, you don't have to worry about being rushed to do your work, don't have to worry about people distracting you while your trying to do your work; Its just you, you are on your own time when you are home schooled or online classes.

Students can do their work while they're on a road trip or something. You can do online classes from anywhere. Online classes are more beneficial than home classes; Home classes are with a teacher or a parent, home classes you have to do the work right then and there. Online you can do it when you get to it, because your all by yourself online. Students get the work done faster online too, its more sources online than with a teacher.

Being in bed while students do they work is great; They can wake up at any time and not a school scheduled time to do their work. Instead of the moving, getting dressed, to do they work at school; They can just do it when they wake up. I think this is way better than video conferencing. Video conferencing is them watching you do the work or you following along with the class at school doing the work.

D087A8C24570,"Many students across the country find boredom in school. They find themselves questioning why they have to wake up five days out of the week, early in the morning, to take a displeasing bus ride to an even more displeasing school. So at first consideration online schooling done from one's home might sound like a great idea, but it is not. Virtual classes taken at ones house can strip students of precious memories and moments in their schooling career, while also limiting the student's education. Virtual classes are not beneficial to students because students would lack the initiative to take the classes, they would miss diverse viewpoints from other students and teachers, and they would miss out on countless opportunities to create new friendships.

Remaining on task plays a major role in getting an education. If you cannot stay focused when you are completing a task, it will never get done to its full potential. Students, especially those getting a high school education or lower, tend to have small attention spans. They can get distracted very easily. Allowing them to take online classes would just lead to them getting distracted by the infinite number of other things they can do at their house. For example, say there is a boy taking online classes from his home and he starts to get bored, so he decides to just go play video games in the middle of a lecture. There is no one to stop him from ignoring his online work. When students are in school, even if they start to get off task, there is always someone there to make sure that everything is operating smoothly. The online schooling has no way to stop students from getting distracted.

Another area where virtual schooling tends to lack is in offering students diverse viewpoints from various teachers and students. Students taking classes from a computer at his or her house are confined to a limited number of people they interact with. They never get to hear any dissenting opinions from other students or see different methods of teaching from professors. By taking classes at school, students are opened up to a wide variety of opinions and new ways of learning. Take for example, two different United States history teachers that teach at the same school; one teacher likes to teach students straight from the textbook, because he feels that is the best way that students retain the information, but the other makes his class fun and engaging because he wants his students to enjoy his class. The student taking online courses would not be able to experience the two different learning environments. The online classes do not allow for students to develop a choice in how they learn their material, ultimately diminishing some students chances to retain knowledge.

Lastly, taking virtual classes takes away a students chances to create memories with friends throughout their schooling career. As I said in the previous paragraph, students that take classes online are limited on their interactions with other people. They do not get to go to school everyday to see their friends. School is an experience that people reflect on and remember for the rest of their lives. People do not remember school because of what they learn though, the reflect on the memories of the relationships that they formed and the bonds that last a lifetime. How is a student supposed to create all of these everlasting bonds and unforgettable memories through a computer screen? The answer is simple, they can not. The virtual classes will result in a child that grows up with no memories of how they had fun at school, the classes strip that child of his or her experiences.

The idea of online schooling is not beneficial when you compare it to traditional school. Students can become easily distracted at home while they are taking their classes; and there is no one there to help them get back on track. The students taking virtual classes are also not introduced to the diverse viewpoints and teaching methods that one kind find at a traditional school. Students taking online classes are also completely shut away from developing any relationship and memories with other students, inherently striping them of lasting experiences. While it is apparent that a students schooling is circumstantial, the evidence is overwhelming that virtual schooling is not beneficial to most students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
19BE726697A9,"Yes, I do think School's should offer online class; for the students who live far away, or any students who would like to take a online course. It is very beneficial for students who learn better in a quieter environment. There are up's and down's for online classes. Some positive things could be, Its taken online, where ever you want, on your laptop, computer, smart phone, tablet. Some negative things could be, you feel like you have enough time to finish your work but the deadline sneaks up on you or if you have bad internet. It has for me, when I took an online course over the summer.

I once took an online class through my public high school. It was terrific, I had received a total score of eighty-eight percent in that online course. The course I took was Algebra two, and I took the course over the summer when I was in Generic_City. I did have many complications when I was there. I had terrible internet over there, because I had many cousins visiting and so many electronics devices were connected. The online course site was terribly made, it wasn't student friendly at all. The site froze many time when I was using it. It had many other computer bugs too.

The only good thing about the online course that I liked, was that you can turn in your assignment any time before the course actually ends, it will not cause you to lose points. When I was taking the online course, I wasn't doing much I was just goofing around with my cousins and not getting my assignments submitted. I was really behind by four or five chapters. When the deadline was coming up, I started doing the assignments after everyone was asleep. I stayed awake for three days straight, until I had finished all my assignments.

Online classes are really beneficial for the students who like to work in a quiet area, also the students who don't like to come to school. These online classes take nine months of information and work and fit it to three months of work.

8201C5613F2C,"Schools are starting to become the only place where students interact. Today everything is revolved around technology. Technology's convenience might ruin the ability for students to learn. Although some may believe otherwise improving social skills, hands on learning, and the ability to cheat proves that students would not benefit from taking distance learning classes at home.

Having the ability to socialize is a very important skill, and it all starts at school. Everyone develops socials skills when they start school. In school there is always someone new to interact with, even if it is just greeting them. With schools implementing classes online, students are losing the chance to interact with others. Some may disagree by saying after the class is completed they can just go outside and do an extracurricular activity. This will not help them improve their social skills because to improve in anything there must be consistency. There is no other consistent place to go for a student than school.

Completing an online course is just as bad as watching television. Both involve staring a screen which virtually accomplishes nothing. In school there are activities that allow students to learn and to do something that isn't just sitting at a desk while listening to a teacher. When a student is completing an online course, most of the material is going in and out their brain. On the contrary students that are actually spending time to learn the course material will actually remember the material. These students are not getting the full extent of how much they can learn. In school teachers can go over any questions and teachers can also go more in depth since they have a whole school year to go over the material. Meanwhile most online courses take about two to three months to complete.

Cheating on an online course is very common. Since the online course is attended at home it is very tempting for a student to cheat. There are many resources that covers specific classes online. Most students cheat on these online courses to finish the class early or just get a free class credit without doing all the work. Some students say they only look up answers to the questions they don't know. If these students were at school they could ask the teacher for extra help on the subject. Though most online courses have a final test that covers everything the student learned they can still cheat on that but, they wouldn't need to cheat if they learned it at school since they know the material.

Despite the convenience of taking an online class at home, students will not benefit from it. The online classes will take away a students social skills, ability to learn and proper work ethics. Schools that offer distance learning can most likely ruin the future generation by allowing students to stay at home to learn. Therefore schools shouldn't allow these classes so, students can grow up with the proper knowledge to succeed in life.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

It seem like a great idea do all your work in the comfortability of your house and not having to stress about other people in your surrondings. Every year, more and more students choose online school because it works better for them; it could also be cheaper this way.

Students would be able to benefit from attenfing classes from home because it give them a flexible schedule, more time to sleep, and it is less risky.

Having a flexible schedule is very important for teenagers, however, is very rare that students that go to school have it. A flexible schedule allow some students to have time to have a job, to spend more time with their families, and to have time to relax. Time can be one of the worst enemies but you can not control it. Looking for opportunities that give you more time for yourself isn't a bad idea.

More time to sleep is very necessary for most of the students. There's many articles that talk about how students can get bad grades when they are tired; lack of sleep is one of the main reasons. Many students have a job after school and it can be really exhausting. It is hard to wake up really early to go to school and try to focus on your classes. If students get a better rest that means they can can better grades.

Online school have a low risk rate. Schools can be really dangerous sometimes, therefore, you never know what can happen inside of it. Having the chance to stay home, lower the risk that something could happen to you. Parent are always look for their kids safety and this is a really good way to keep them safe. We all have heard many tragic and concerning stories that had happen at schools. This is a great way to prevent all those risks.

In conclusion, online school can be beneficiary for both students and parents. They would benefit attending classes from home because it gives them a flexible schedule, more time to sleep, and it is less risky for them In fact, this is a privilage because not all schools offer this opportunity.

C5162A975732,"Is distance learning through video and online conferencing a great and beneficial way for students to learn from home or does it hinder one's chances of actually learning and having a good learning experience? Video conferencing is widely used in today's society as technology has boosted and upgraded. People often use video conferencing as a means to chat, have meetings and most importantly, educational purposes such as having class online. Many may claim that video conferencing through distance learning is a good thing because it gives students adequate time to spend time with family and have time for their jobs as well while taking classes online. Video Conferencing is not very advisable and great because having a face to face teaching can really help students understand better, learning at home can bring unwanted distractions that keep students from staying focused and distance learning also promotes laziness and affects health.

Firstly, video conferencing with distance learning from home is not advisable and great because students may prefer that they have a face to face talk with a teacher. In cases where a student may not understand something, having to physically be there in a school building and ask a question, the teacher can demonstrate carefully and step by step till the student is able to get a grasp of what is being taught and questions are clarified. Some students just prefer having the need to be around to understand, it makes it better for them. Whereas, when students are far away and learning through a video conference or online, it may be harder to understand because demonstrations may be a little unclear through a video. when there is a need for a question, doing classes online there's no one to ask at times so students have to go the extra mile of looking into researches, YouTube videos, etc before they're able to understand. something which waste time from their studies and brings conflict. Video conferencing is not advisable and taking classes may be better face to face which brings peace and makes things better.

Secondly, video conferencing with distance learning from home is not advisable and great because it brings distractions. Taking classes online and learning from home brings unwanted distractions such as having the need to sleep, watching TV, playing games and having to take care of kids while doing class at the same time. With these distractions, students are not able to get their classes and work done, they're not able to stay focused on their task which can result in bad grades and affect one's education. This can eventually lead to depression and failure which is very sad and dangerous and needs to be taken seriously. A student may even struggle to get their grades up having to constantly deal with these distractions while juggling classes online. Video conferencing is not great and students should go to a school building and study to best eliminate any possible distractions to learn.

Thirdly, video conferencing with distance learning is not advisable and great because it promotes laziness and affects health. some students that often take online courses may get bored because they're constantly staring at a screen, so taking online classes starts to get boring for them and they start to get lazy and refrain from doing their work, students do that because they're constantly staring at a screen which starts to give eye problems. sitting behind a screen for prolonged hours causes problems for the eyes such as watery eyes and pain in the eye, sometimes eye twitches which make learning frustrating. So as a result, students stop doing their work. Whereas in a school building, students are not always looking at screens but white boards also which is less harmful to the eyes. Students are not lazy because classes ring from bell to bell, so students are always up and moving rather that sitting behind a computer all day. It's best to go to school without being lazy and staying healthy rather than using a video conference to learn.

In conclusion, video conferencing and taking online classes with distance learning is not the best thing for students, because of the conflict and problems that come with it. It can greatly affect a student's education. With online classes, students may be faced with distractions which can cause them to stay off task and bring down their grades leading to frustration and depression. This can lead to suicidal thoughts and drain a student's life. Health is very important, and it is necessary that our bodies should be healthy. Taking online courses can have a negative and tragic effect on a student's body leading to eye problems, the eye being a very important body part. This may eventually let the student become unproductive and lazy. Also many students prefer having a face to face teaching session to make learning more efficient and better to understand overall. Students across the world should be able to learn the importance of physically being in school where there's plenty of teachers and resources around. Being in school is very important and can greatly benefit students. Technological advancements in the modern world is also very important and have been beneficial in helping with education and making education better. But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.                             ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
AB7706113077,"How would you feel if your child stopped going to school and started from home?

Schools are offering distance learning for students to learn and attend classes from their house.

This may seem like a brilliant idea for students to have classes over a online or video call, yet going a public or private school is more likely to help your child grow in becoming a more intelligent person.

Also, you hear your child come home and they tell you something bad or how they dont like being at school, but your child tells you about something that they learned in school that they did know the other day. If your child went to school from their house, they could end up hate being at home so much and stop doing their work.

Most students would not benefit from being able to attend classes at home or over a screen.

Therefore, I strongly believe that students attending classes from home is not the best interest for their ability to learn.

To start off, students need an environment where they can go to for 5 days of of the week, know what they are doing, and know who to talk to when they have an important question.

Most of the time, students are always asking for help in some type of way, and if your child can not get in touch of the teacher who is helping her online, will you be able to help her or answer her questions?

A computer is the same thing as a phone, and most parents don't want their child on his/her phone all the time.

Giving your child the ability to do his/her class work over a computer would make them so excited for the first week, yet your child will be more interested with the fact of being able to be on a computer all day instead of sitting in a class room.

The student will stop wanting to learn or end up wanting to go back to school because they can't understand anything.

Furthermore, letting a student take their classes over a screen or call is not doing the best for them nor for yourself.

On the other hand, others believe that having their child stay home to do his/her class work can keep them out of trouble.

I do not disagree with the fact that it could keep them out of trouble, but students going to school is not the cause of them misbehaving.

The main cause of children getting into trouble is them trying to get attention form someone, he/she could feel left out, be getting bullied, or are not in the right state of mind and are being rebellious because they are not being seen for the person they want to be.

Making a child stay at home and do their school work over a video call is not going to stop them from getting into trouble.

School a place to learn, while home is a place to be loved and with family.

Being able to be thought something from face to face interactions are more precise than leaning the same way some from someone over a screen that might not even know that they are teaching. Therefore, wanting your child to have their classes over a computer because you think it can keep them out of trouble, is not look out for the best way for your child to grow into a smarter human being.

Offering students to attend his/her classes at home by a video conferencing is not their best way to benefit them in education.

As I stated before, students having the opportunity to stay at home and do their work online will most likely excite them at first, yet they will be more interested to the fact of being on a computer then their class work. Students are always getting their phones took in class and being able to stay home and be on their phone and a computer at the same time is like giving a four or five year old two cookies instead of one.

Also, is will cause students to misbehave more if they don't have rules about the work.

School has rules and if students dont follow the rules, they get punished for misbehaving.

Are you able to control your child if he/she decides that they don't want to do their work or misbehave in any type of way that they do at school?

First, Student really love this idea that they don't have to go anywere I was doing school my dad have to drop me school everyday he was allways angry on me in morning, because I was disturbing his sleep everyday I also understand that my dad is also tired, and he have to do work whole day he need sleep too so then I find out about online class, and I start taking it from that time everything was going great my dad get good sleep I can take classes while eating brackfast, and there was no problem at all.

Next, this is basd on my personnel experience when I was taking online class, and it so helpfull, fun, enjoying class I ever had there are many different types of classes you can take like video chat, online class I was taking online one, and that was my first time you can just listen to teacher, and see what she is doing on computer screen you aslo can chat whit randam student who was taking same classes and teacher as you even you can't see teacher on screen she just send her photo In email on bigning of corse.

Finally, student also like this benefit that they can pass early they don't have to spend whole year on one subject specially for seniors who have to pass two classes In one year I take Geometry, because I want to take Algbra 2 next year so I can graduate, and It really help me my friends, cozens, familly they all saying that how you gonna pass two subject in one year then I take online class, and I don whit that class in 2 month I was feeling greatfull, and proud myself everyone was shock my mom dad say you did a good job my son I cried.

I think all school around the world have to be closed, and start online class system they should do that It's very helpfull, and easy for everyone can't afored transpotion It also can help student to graduat, and they can have there own freedom.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
5FA8C1D30129,"In today's world, schools accross the world are modernizing in many different ways. In fact, the concept of going to school itslef is changing drastically. With new innovations and technologies, some students have the ability to attend school without physically attending school. This new method of learning is made possible by the concept of ""distance learning"", which allows students to attend classes either from their home by way of online or through video conferencing. All students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home through the internet because it gives students the opportunity to learn and be engaged in the classroom from anywhere, it is a more modern and efficient way of learning, and it opens the doors for the creation of international schools, which could make schools much more culturally diverse.

One reason why students would benefit from being able to take classes from home is because it would allow students to have the opportunity to travel and have worldly experiences, while still being engaged in the classroom. The possibility for students to be able to learn from anywhere is very promising. It would allow for students to gain new experiences on a global scale, while still learning the core subjects in school. For example, students who are incredibly interested in the Classics could be in Italy or Greece further pursuing their interests in this relam, while still being engaged in their school work and lessons from their school at home by means of these video conferences or online classes. If a student were to go visit family in another location, having the ability to take online classes or use video conferences to keep up with their schoolwork would also be incredibly beneficial because it would prevent them from falling behind. These are just a few circumstances in which having access to online classes or video conferences would be beneficial for students; they would give all students the opportunity to learn from anywhere.

Another reason why it would be beneficial for students to attend classes anywhere by means of the internet or video conferencing is because it could open the door for the creation of international schools. If students had the ability to attend classes without physically being in the classroom, it could allow for schools globally to collaborate and intermix. Students from South Africa could be enrolled in the same classes as students from Japan or the United States. Having the ability to crease internationally mixed classrooms would greatly benefit students; it would make classrooms much more culturally, racially, and ethnically diverse, which would overall enrich the experience for all of the studnets. Students would have the opportunity to engage with students from various backgrounds and to also learn about other cultures and places around the world. While the students would still be separated physically by thousands of miles in some cases, they would be unified in the online classrooms and would have the opportunity to get to know indiviaduals who they would likely have never met otherwise. This experience would overall allow students to further develop their understanding of not only other cultures, but also of the world.

Although there are many advantages to this new method of attending school, there are also some notable disadvantages. Giving students the opportunity to attend classes from home using the internet or video conferences could give some studnets less of an incentive to physically attend school. Some students who don't particualrly enjoy school may see this as an opportunity to not go to school. There are also notable benefits from physically attending school; it allows students to learn life skills, create relationships, and it gives students the traditional, true ""school"" experience. Although these can be seen as reasons why implementing the opportunity for attending school using the internet may be a bad idea, the benefits that this would provide for students are far more important and enriching.

All students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home through the internet because it would allow students to learn and be engaged in the classroom from anywhere accross the world and and it opens the doors for the creation of international schools, which would make schools much more culturally diverse. As the world modernizes and people's ways of life change, schools will also change. Giving students the opportunty to attend classes without physically being in the classroom by means of the internet or video conferencing would be an improvemment to schools and would allow them to develop and modernize along with the rest of the world as it becomes increasingly technological. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
E4306421A388,"Students nowadays are being more drawn to technology more than ever before. This even brought the attention of many schools to allow distance learning for students. Many students would benefit from video conferencing or online classes by allowing students who may have social anxiety or have experience bullying to take an online class, students can also learn more effectively at the comfort of their own home, and can even save time and energy for teachers and students alike

Nowadays, many students suffer from some form of mental illness. In fact, 1 in 4 high school and middle school students suffer from some form of depression or anxiety. In order to combat this raging epidemic, online or video conferencing must be provided. Although some may say allowing online classes can take away from the high school experience, that however, is flawed because many people have benefited from online classes not only in grades, but in mental health. For example, my friend Generic_Name suffers from anxiety caused by recent school shootings and social interaction. She constantly over thinks every social interaction and even thinks the person she is talking to is ridiculing them when in reality, that is not the case. She eventually did take an online class at the comfort of her own home, which reduced a lot of the stress she had from school. I saw a gradual increase in her mood. If someone like her can improve, many others can as well. She was no longer afraid of her previous fears. Another example is with myself. When I was injured during a wrestling tournament, I was gone away from school to recover. I, however, wanted to continue my education so I would not be far behind when I came back. I picked up a video conference call with my teachers and was able to catch up with my classmates. I was relieved and was stress free when I came back. Schools should not only allow it, but they should motivate their students in taking online classes as an viable option.

With schools becoming ever more competitive, this has put a tremendous amount of weight on not only students, but teachers as well. By allowing distance learning, much of this unneeded stress can be lifted form their shoulders. With online classes comes the ability to record a class in session, compared to not being able to record a lecture from your teacher. Although some may say students may cheat or slack off during online classes, online classes already have built in counter measures to mitigate those exact problems. For instance, I took an online class during the summer for Algebra 2. My class and I had to be all online at a certain time throughout the week. The class only lasted for an hour and thirty minutes, with small quizzes and lecture notes. I was able to ask questions and talk to my online teacher more effectively than I would have in a class in school. I came out of it with a B+ overall, and definitely learned more because of the online class. Not only that, but my teacher who was also taking care of her kids, was able to be a mother and teacher at the same time. If there was anything wrong on her end of the call, she would quickly excuse her self and give us a small break time until she resolved any issue. It was flexible and effective. Schools must encourage individuals to take online classes if they want to see improvement in their students.

I think everyone has been there. The point where you decide to go into Lala land for a quick minute, only to become lost in the lecture the teacher has been giving, scrambling to find out what just happened. In online classes, teachers and students can record a lesson in any given moment. It is way more convenient for the teacher and student to record a lecture, than to restate everything that has been said. Not only that, but students can re watch, or re listen to any part of the class to get a better understanding of the subject. While some may say online classes encourages shortcuts to be made, this however is flawed due to the fact that many students prefer, and many more students end up passing online classes more than a conventional class. For example, my friend and I had to make up an assignment over Spring break. We had the option to take an online video conference call with my English teacher to be retaught the subject. My friend and I came in not wanting to do it. Since it was Spring break and I would rather play video games all day and stay outside past curfew with my friends. However, the video conference call changed the way I viewed my class and my own teacher. I was able to communicate, and even joke around my teacher making her laugh. It allowed for what I thought to be something serious, to be something fun and enjoyable. After Spring break, my friend and I became even more close, and still visit my sophomore English teacher to this day.

In an age where technology is growing ever more prevalent with the old and young. The school system is systematically failing its students by creating a stigma with online classes and video conferences. There is a lot to be benefited for the youth, especially now with these options in learning. It not only solves many of the problems society faces today, but it can also bridge the gap between students and teachers. Teachers are getting out of touch with their students, but by allowing online classes, more often than not, students and teachers will grow to understand one another in a comfortable environment. Classes should not be looked at with disdain from both parties, but should be looked at with optimism and positively. In an already serious world, society should bring back the fun in learning.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
172DCAD4E21A,"Every student hate waking up early in the morning for School. Some schools have now offered a distance learning option,Meaning students can take classes online from home. Classes would be taken at home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people might think this is a good idea other's might also not agree with this decision. The idea of taking classes at home is the greatest accomplishment in my opinion.

I agree with the Idea of taking classes online at home. Being able to learn and do assignment at home can be helpful in so many ways,Online classes would benefit students with serious health issues that can't go outside so they're stuck in the house or their room for some years, Online classes would give opportunity to students with a family that decides to go on a vacation during the school year a chance to learn and also keep up with their school work while they're gone. Students might be having issues with the concept of how school classrooms work. Online classes would be a major help for home schooled kids. Some online classes cover subjects or topics that aren't thought at school. Research have made it clear that students who usually sit alone at lunch and others who sit at the back of classrooms with nobody to talk to find it hard to fit it with others around them, so they'd rather just take online classes at home.

Online classes would benefit those with serious health issues that can't go outside so, they're stuck in the house or their room for some years. I think every kids deserve a chance of getting a education no matter what the situation is. Kids with health issues that stays home would have the opportunity to be educated because of online classes. It would give the opportunity for kids with health issues that can't go outside make new friends online while also learning with each other. Online classes would also give students the same amount of education that students that prefer going to school get while they're staying home. Kids with health issues will also have an experience what it's like being at school or in a learning environment but it in a different dimension while they're at home.

Online classes would give students with a family that decades to go on vacation during the school year a chance to learn while they're gone. When students students go away for a vacation they start to fail when assignments aren't turned in. Online classes would give students in that situation a chance to keep up with work while they're on vacation. Online classes would also play a role in learning the same thing as their peers in school are learning. Online classes classes would also be able to educate students while spending time with family. I went on vacation my sophomore year of high school during the middle of the school year. I never got the chance to keep up with work or my grade while I was gone so i ended up having an F being gone for a couple of weeks. If i had the opportunity to take an online class while being gone i would have ended up with a good grade, even though i went on vacation. t turned in.

Research have made it clear that students who usually sit alone at lunch and others who sit at the back of every classroom with nobody to talk to always find it hard to fit in. Online classes would play a major role in their life because they would have the option to be themselves at home where they feel most comfortable at while learning, just like they would while going to school. Parents wouldn't have to be worried about they're kid being bu llied because they're attending school at home where nobody would bother them. Online classes would also give students chance to make friends online and have a social life while learning at home.

Online classes may also have some bad outcomes such as, students could be cheating on assignments and test using the internet or asking family members for help. Not every everyone have what it takes to afford a laptop or computer, sometimes the case may even be having access to a internet may be the problem for others. Some students will not be willing to do work since they're be forced to do it while being at home. Another issue is students might be having a hard time understanding the online tools or the teacher while being taught online. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
3C1B911C0C75,"How is distance learning more beneficial than traditional public schooling? In recent years, students have been given the opportunity to attend classes from home. This availability has not only shown a great increase in student participation, but an increase in overall passing. I believe many high school students could benefit from distance learning because it is more convenient for those with obligations outside of school and the environment of a public school can be overwhelming at times; However, the actual efficiency of distance learning depends on each student's learning preference.

Each year, technology advances further and provides access to much more convenient means of learning. Distance learning gives students the opportunity to not only learn outside of school, but also the chance to better balance their time. Many high school students are choosing to become employed and with access to attend classes from home, they can better schedule time between work and school. Others may have obligations to family or peers which leads to low attendance percentages; In an institution's perspective, higher rates of attendance means they are doing well. Allowing students to take online classes means those who can't physically be at school, can still complete their courses without damaging their school's, or their own, image. Attending classes from home also teaches students responsibility, accountability, and expands their learning abilities, each of which are skills that will be crucial to succeeding in future careers.

Furthermore, public schools can be very overwhelming for many students. As a student with multiple anxieties myself, I perceive distance learning as a way to escape the unnecessary stresses that come with attending a public school. Having the opportunity to complete courses online, from home, means there is no need to feel obligated to look or act in any particular way. Students would not feel so pressured to meet the high expectations some teachers reflect, and could work at their own pace. In addition, it has been found that students who teach themselves, whether it be online or out of a textbook, are much more flexible when it comes to finding a career; Flexibility is an important characteristic because many employers look for someone reliable who can multitask. With each of these things in mind, distance learning might sound ideal for everyone.

However, not all students prefer, nor are capable of, distance learning. All people have different learning preferences, and some would rather sit in a physical classroom simply because they learn better that way. Though many students find this method endearing, some are not yet capable of the responsibility that needs to be taken in order to complete courses from home. Although this way of learning can benefit many students, it should not become the sole way of teaching because it is not inclusive to all.

In conclusion, I agree with the statement that students would benefit from being able to take classes from home; However, I do not think this is an ideal method for all students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
53531A799B5D,"A lot of accidents and misfortunes can happen without expecting it. Kids and teens can catch a sickness and have to be confined to a bed for months, being unable to move. Once they recover, they'll realize that they've missed a whole month of school, missing a heap of work and a couple of tests. They'll feel dreaded from thinking of all of the work that they'll have to catch up on. These students would be able to catch up with their classmate easier if they were able to do their work at home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because students will able to catch up with work while sick or injured and can work at their own pace.

Students will have the ability to attempt to catch up if they're sick or injured to the point where they can't even try to walk properly. Any student who happened to be in a car accident for example, they'll still be able to manage their way to get some of their work out. Having a pile of homework and classwork to do is not easy from the perspective of a child that's trying to recover from a disease pr injury, maybe even surgery. Any accident has a possibility of happening and there;s no real way of changing if it can or can't happen. Students shouldn't have to worry about the amount of work they have to do because they were out of school, but should only worry about their recovery.

Students can work the amount of work that needs to be done at their own pace. Some kids work faster than others and are told to slow down. Some kids work slower than others and are told to speed up. Being able to work at home will remove these pressures off of them and let them work how fast they are willing to work. This help students by not feeling rushed to do what needs to be done, letting the same students to not have to guess on questions they have to think or work out. Instead they could just study a little bit, go back to the question, and then continue to finish up any problems they had without having to be concerned about the speed of their work.

Some people may argue that being able to attend classes at home would make student lazy or that it would defeat the purpose of school. Or that some kids may act sick just so that they could stay at home. These reasons or understandable, but the students who are in need of attending classes at home should be given that necessity. Only the students who can't come to school for any reason should be able to take their classes at home or where they are. It's better this way so that when the student comes back to their school, they aren't forced to do a pound of work that's due in a week. It's simply more effective this way than not letting students do their work at home.

In conclusion, being able to attend classes at home would be a benefit to some kids. Students could work at home if they are sick or injured and they won't need to be in any type of rush to do their missing work. Though they are thought to be some downsides, the pros easily out wight the cons. Students need to be able to do their work on their time so that when they go back to school, they won't have to worry about the amount of work that's missing. Rather, they'll have to worry about what;s being taught in their respective classes. Letting kids, teens, and adults do their school work at home could help them majorly in the long run.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
505BC02CDE23,"Is online schooling really school? Many school systems have been looking into online education. This is not a good idea. When students are given the oppertunity to learn at home how do they stay fouced like they do at school. Online learning presents a plethera of new challanges to over come to keep students focused. When at home students have the ability to cheat, be distracted by home issues or games and are unable to ask questions.

The first problem with online education is cheating. Since there is no teacher in the room, how are schools able to know if a student is using another device to help with with a test or worksheet. This has been an issue with oline testing even in schools because students are able to switch tabs quickly without anyone knowing. My sisters AP class is currently having that issue. Her teacher is beginning to do less things online to stay away from temtation of looking up answers. Another things to think about with cheating is, how many people are at someone's house? A group of students could all be in the same room (not on camera) and are helping eachother with a test or quiz or even a learning activity. It may seem like the learning activity will be good as a group but, if only one person is answering the questions, all the other students will not retain any of the information. The last problem with cheating is when a parent or sibiling is in the room. How are teachers supposed to keep a family form helping their child or sibiling when they are at home. A parent only wants there child to succed so, they might help here or there. With all these abilities to cheat, online learning will not be able to stop them all.

My next concern with online learning is with distractions. When at school, their are obviously distractions but, a teacher is able to aid and stop most of them. At home, the distractions only increase with no way of stopping them. New distractions like, I need to clean my room or the dog needs to be walked or I could watch this TV show while i'm working come into play. Even other people in the house could be distracting. A

parent may be using the vaccum, which is a loud distracting noise, or even asking for help when they are unloading the groceries that takes a student away from class. A younger sibiling may want to play a game or be having a trantrum that makes it hard to pay attation to anything else. Once a person gets distracted once, they will find another and another until they are completly away from there school work. My cousin has resenly gone to college and was finding it hard to study in her dorm due to everything else she could be doing. She found that if she went to the library or to the outside study quad, she got a lot more done. This works the same for students learning in a class or school setting rather then in a home setting.

My final reason that home and online schooling is a bad idea is with asking questions. Students need the ability to ask questions when learning. It is the only way to make sense of what is going on when confused. If a teacher is recording herself teacher the lesson and everyone is watching how will she answer questions. The teacher would have to stop ever five seconds to see if someone left a comment about what they don't understand. This would take way to long and would be distracting from learning the actual information. Another issue is that not all online videos have the ability to leave comments to communicate. How do students ask any questions at all when that is the case? They can't. Because of not being able to ask questions students will retain less and not understand more. Now, test scores will go down and more students will stop caring. This leads to all the other earlier problems like cheating and being distracted. It's hard for people to work at something when the only fail because they can't get help. This is jsut like when babies learn to walk. If a parent isn't there helping them start off, they will never learn how to walk. Online learning will only make learning harder for students.

All in all, home and online learning should not be put inplace. There are way to many things that can take students focuse off of school and put it onto anythings else. Why make it harder for students when the main goal is for them to succed?",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
5ED9F80F1134,"In this time, where technology is something that we need to live, educations is not an exception. Technology offer us many way to facilite our way to live, it can have many point of views. As a person that lives in the ""Millenial"" time, it can be very helpful to have an education online, but at the same time required a lot of responsability from part of the student.

Online education is something that is very flexible with our schedules, as an student, I attend school, but at the same time I have to work, so here is the point, with online education you have the facility to control all your schedule and also you can still have free time. But there is people that don't think the same, my father always told me that eduaction is the base of all, and in some way an online class its never going to be the same as a ""common"" class, it can have cons and pros. A con, is that when you are taking an online class you are required to buy all the material that you need, you do not have the accesibility to ask questions and be inmmediatly anwser, and also its cover some topic very ""quickly"". Pros, one of the major reasons why people choose online education is because, they have the control of their schedule, they can take classes in any place through smart devices like, Ipads, cell phones, etc. Another major pro, is the price, we can compare this two, and if you are going to get the same level of education by less of the price, it can be a major reason why people choose this option.

Now lest talk about tips to take an online course, one of the things that people should think about when they want to take any couse, or class online is their level responsability, during the last summer, I took the English 12 class, and the very first thing that my consuler told me was,

""It is a lot of work, be responsable!""

So one of the thing that you should make before the first class start is, make an schedule, create a time to start and finish each module of the class, also, take a time to make a little research of topics that you did not understand. Many of the times you are going to feel frustration, but the best thing is ti take a deep breath and keep going. I found these tips helpful because, apart of the classes, you actually are working in your own respondability, you are developing a new skill, however, we still have the common and conventional eduaction, and as well it has prons and cons, when talking about your ""social like"" this one is the best, why? you are able to create your socal group, people that is interested in the same thing that you like, you see differents poits of view, you are around people that can even help you with your future, while in the online, you sometimes don't even know who is your teacher. Another pro, is the fact that the institution that you are studing can bring you many opportunities, like, materials, jobs, schoolarships, etc. The cons of the regular education, you are required to follow a certain schedule, It can take many time that you can use for many other things, and sometimes you take classes that are totally unecessary.

We can see many difference in these two, but they have in commin one thing, and is that they both bring us education, we develop new skill, we learn new thing. In conclution, many school, colleges, universities, etc, are using these new way to lear, online eudation can give us a great level of eduaction, it can work more with our schedules, and its you basically can learn anywhere. Implementing online educations can benefit our young society, why? because they are going to learn about responsability, also, not many people have the opportunity to pay for a private and regular education that can cost sometimes 60% more, so we would be helping people with low resources to have an education. We have to understand that there is millions of students that work and have to study at the same time and sometimes they don't have time to turn their respectives assigments at the time they were required, however, there are many and very different options with online educations, some colleges, offer two years doing your carrer online, and the other two you have to attend the college, but paying less of the price. With online eduaction we can contribute a lot of talented people out there, and also many adults can take this classes while working, its is a benefit not just for teenagers, adults that want to have a diplome in an are that they like, but they coud never study, online education is the tool for these people, technology is a great advance that give many great resources that can help us daily. As an student I suppor online education,because it contribute with the development of my generation, and help many people with low resorces that don't have the acces to pay a regular education. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
572258CAB3B0,"When it comes to education, there are various ways that one can receive it. Many people automatically assume that going to a physical school is the only option or at least the best one because that is what the majority of people do. At a young age, we learn that we must go to school to be successful and we learn to deal with waking up early, getting on a school bus, and attending school for seven hours a day. We have school to thank for all that we know up until this point and what we will become in the future. However, there are other options that students can take to receive just as good of an education that a school in a building can provide. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to learn at their own pace and resolves many issues that they may have faced at a physical school.

Following the pace of a teacher can be difficult at times, especially when you don't understand something. Teachers can't always stop lessons to tend to one individual students' needs because it delays the learning of the other students in the classroom. Or, something may be very easy for you but you aren't able to move on to the next thing because students around you aren't as comfortable with that specific topic, so the teacher has to spend more time on it. Also, learning in a space where there are many other people around you doesn't work for everyone because we all process learning differently. With online school, one is able to move as slowly or fast as they like to make sure they understand something to its entirety. Since you are learning virtually, you aren't pressured to hurry and you can be relaxed with knowing that no one is waiting on you. Additionally, you aren't faced with distractions that a classroom is bound to have. Whether it be by students who just aren't focused or by any other inevitable distraction, it isn't fair that you can't be fully focused on doing your work because of other situations that are out of your control. However, going fully home schooled isn't the only way to take online classes. Even if you are able to take a few of your classes online and the rest at school, it can still be very beneficial. Those classes taken online will allow you to stay home until it's necessary to go to school. With online classes, one is able to complete their work in the comfort of their own home with their undivided attention.

Although going to school can be a positive experience and is a good way to create fun memories, it's not like that for everyone. Bullying is a huge issue in schools and when a student is bullied, it can really affect their overall life which includes their attitude on learning. Bullying is a very serious issue and isn't always addressed because some people are afraid to stand up for themselves in fear of what will happen. The point of going to school is to get an education while the other things that school entails are just bonuses such as making friends. However, when a distraction such as getting bullied occurs in a students life, it becomes extremely difficult to keep yourself focused on the important things. School isn't something you should dread to go to everyday so it comes to a point where you have to look at your options and see what the best way for you to get your education is. So, a student and their parents may decide to resort to online classes because that is what's best for the student and the situation they are in.

Some people may say that taking online classes is overall, not beneficial to students because it isolates them from other people their age and doesn't allow them to have the best education possible. However, this is not true because taking online classes isn't an attempt to isolate oneself, but is done because it is what's best for that person. Just because someone takes classes from home doesn't mean they don't have friends or a social life. There are other opportunities and places to make friends so that shouldn't be the ultimate factor for someone deciding if they should switch over to online classes or not. The argument that online school doesn't provide the best education isn't valid because some of the most successful people in the world have completed online classes and have publicly credited them to be a great way to learn. The programs that these classes are provided by make sure that the classes are well taught and teach everything that the student needs to know. People who take online classes are learning the same things that someone in a regular classroom is learning; the difference is the setting in which they are learning the content in.

Taking online classes can be very beneficial for students who choose to do so because it gives them another way to learn that will work better than going to a tangible school. By taking online classes, it gives a wide array of options and you can figure out what works best for you. Students are able to have one-on-one interactions with their instructors which allows them to gain knowledge in a more effective way. In conclusion, if students feel like online education would be the most beneficial way for them due to issues faced at physical school, they should have the opportunity to explore their options. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
3899C281559F,"Attending classes at home is not a great benefit for a student to learn and have better skills because they would not concentrate, many noises in the house that are going on that cause them hard to focus on their learning, online learning that will be a bad influence for a student because of the messages that are popping on their phone or computer that is a distraction that will make students fail their learning, students that have sisters or brother in their house that will be a hard time for them to learn.

Firstly, everyone knows that in a house their is a lot of noises that are going on by their parent yelling, brothers or sisters their distracting, or is your house is being repaired a lot of tool noises. Some teenagers get annoyed by that problem, so by taking classes at home that will make students to not focus, learn less, and what future will they have.

Secondly, online learning that is bad influence for a student because their is lot of traffic going on phones or computers one of them are messages. Messages are a distraction for a student to learn or focus when they are learning. For example, this student was learning online and than he see a message pop on his screen of his device that is probably from his parents or friend text and he gets' untask what he was watching or learning.

Lastly, many students have brothers or sisters and taking classes at home that will be one of the problems that students will have. You know that little brothers or sisters will be a distraction when you are studying at home. Generally, going to school and learning their that will be a great choice by the government than rather taking classes at home. You get better skills or learning in school because it is all in order.

Although many students will like this idea taking classes at home by just grabbing their computers or phone and ready to study. Their is a main reason why they would like t because their will not be teachers' to tell them where to sit, to be quiet or getting in trouble.

In conclusion, this are the three main things that i disagree that taking classes at home will be a benefit for students because many noises in the house that are going on that cause them hard to focus on their learning, online learning that will be a bad influence for a student because of the messages that are popping on their phone or computer that is a distraction that will make students fail their learning, students that have sisters or brother in their house that will be a hard time for them to learn.                                                                                     ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
C0F9FAE946AE,"Students, if given the chance, would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. A large portion of kids all over the world struggle to go to school because of various scenarios and responsibilities that prevent them from going to school. Whether the problem be a disability, large distances, a dangerous environment, or problems in their own life, people may need a method of education that can work anywhere and anytime.

Many students may live in areas where technology is scarce or has a lack of constructed buildings, so their designated school may be far away from their house. This leaves them with two traveling opportunities: take transportation or go by foot. In many cases, though, these places tend to not have any metros, roads, or even have anything like bikes to ride. This changes the choice to ""Should I go, or should I not?"", as it may well not even be worth it to traverse to their destination for hours just to walk back afterwards. If we were to start having online classes, they would be able to communicate with their teachers efficiently as long as they had electronics.

For those who are severely injured, or quarantined in their room from being sick, they're likely to be stuck at home as a means of preventing the reopening of wounds or getting others at school sick. With the help of technology, they can still attend their classes without falling behind on late work they would have missed out on without worrying that they might spread their disease or put themselves in risk of getting injured again. Even if it's not a disability that keeps them away from school, there may be family responsibilities, especially for those in the poorer classes. These responsibilities may range from helping their family business, taking care of their younger siblings, doing all of the house work to relief stress for their parents, or any family member being in the hospital, these can be random and often times sporadic for those who struggle in terms of income. These are usually resposibilities they cannot say no to, and so being able to take classes via the internet allows them to multitask and not have to give up their education.

Most people believe, however, that those who want online classes are just using it as an excuse to be lazy, or so that they may slack off without the teacher seeing. While they may be true for some, the danger is real. Even if school is maybe a ten or so minute walk, or you have a bus stop nearby, parents have realized that in that short amount of time, you may get lost or attacked. Cities are a prime example of a dangerous environment for children and teens alike. Thee may be a lot of dark alleyways or corners on a student's route to school, and they can early be robbed or kidnapped at each turn. There has also been an influx of school shootings, in which people would rather stay in the safety of their own home than go to school. During extreme weather and natural disasters, school chooses to cancel school or have an early dismissal so that the students arent endangered, which wouldn't be a problem if we had our classes online instead. With online classes, students would be able to ask questions during the weekend, or while caved in by a snowstorm.

When looking at a small scale, like a single county or school, it may look like everyone's attending and keeping up with their grades, but when looked upon at a larger scale, like other states and even countries, it's obvious that there's a huge problem. Many people worldwide decide whether they like it or not, that they do not have the time or means to go to school everyday, which comes back to haunt them in the future when they go looking for a job. With the support of online classes and video conferencing, we could provide everyone with a solution to this dilemma.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7EA804FD13A8,"Students are exhausted. Sitting in a classroom for seven hours a day is tiresome and inhibits the learning of many. However, technological advancements may have a solution. Online learning, such as online lectures and video classes, have replaced the traditional classroom in many settings, though with mixed reception. However, I believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because of efficiency, preparatory experience for college, and a positive learning environment.

I believe attending class through the internet results in more efficient learning for students. According to the psychological Yerkes-Dodson Theory, if one experiences too much stress, their level of performance will decrease dramatically. If students are too stressed out, they may not be performing at their absolute best. This may result in decreased test scores, class averages, and overall learning retention. Although some say that learning from home is counter intuitive, online learning can actually be more productive than at school. By learning at home, students no longer have to deal with the everyday stresses and hassles that they face at school. Being in the familiar presence of their own home instills a certain degree of relaxation in students, which is absolutely vital to boosting productivity. Through the use of online learning, students are likely to become more productive, efficient, and better learners.

I believe students should be exposed to online learning to help prepare them for college. Many universities have already implemented online learning in their curriculum for a multitude of courses, such as Computer Science and Human Resources. By learning from home, kids know what to expect when they arrive at college, easing the transition for first-year students. Without a strong foundation in online learning, students will not know how to navigate the digital classroom and fall behind. Ultimately, students who know the mechanics, aspects, and overall feel of online learning will likely have a better chance of succeeding in college than those without it. In the end, I believe students who engage in online learning would have a greater preparedness for college.

I believe students would benefit from attending classes from home because it is a more positive learning environment than school. In my experience as a high school student, many of my peers are very judgmental. They often make fun of and berate other students who struggle when learning. Students who need more time to grasp the content or just ask basic questions are often targeted and ridiculed. This makes it extremely difficult to meaningfully engage with the material because most traditional classrooms are unsafe learning environments. However, by staying at home, students are free from the contempt of their peers and able to reach their true learning potential. Therefore, I believe students would benefit from a more positive learning environment if they studied from home.

As an educator, the success of one's students is of utmost importance. Therefore, I believe schools should seriously consider learning from home if they want to improve their students' quality of learning. The use of online learning can augment students in different ways, such as increased productivity or better preparation for higher education. By letting them learn from home, schools can help transform students into well-rounded, efficient individuals. After all, shouldn't schools push their students for the absolute best?",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
CD7860A8F65C,"Students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home or online. Most people who take online school have jobs and families they need to worry about so that why online is so successful for adults over the age of thirty. Most online school caters to adults who are have jobs but still want to get their education in timely but inexpensive manner. Though the concept of school is a hands on experience meant for learning, practicing social skills, that focuses on core values and ethics that every kid should endorse.

School has been a concept forever intertwined with the modern day man. Controversy about schooling is constantly making headlines in the public eye, whether it be about a head masters lying or schools giving out one thousand dollar scholarships. Public schools help us reflect on what we have achieved over the hundreds and thousands of years, whether that be basic math, science, writing, or history. Some people could argue that they understand a class enough not to attend, but it costs more to do online than it does to do public. Though not all countries have a free educational system that tries to be supportive of the lower class not being able to pay. Normally payment is at the beginning of every year and is fairly cheap compared to what it could be in other countries.

It can be argued that with the growing teenage population, more disrespect is shown in school, thus making students not want to attend certain classes. School has given every chance they have to show us that there will be people in the real world who won't care about your ability to get your work done if they are distraction to you. Being introduced to other people at a young age prepares us that we can't just think for ourselves anymore and always remember that people can be affected by what you do. When taking online classes the ability to communicate with others about how you got an answer isn't there just because you didn't want to be in a loud class. In math you can use different equations to get the same answer but some are easier than others, but without the other students their it complicates thing by making you learn one way and no other.

Core values have been an important issue that kids ,especially teenagers, are forgetting. we pick up core values and ethics from the people around us and what we emerce our selfs into to on the TV. If someone doesnt hang around a lot of people then they won't be as sympathetic or understand how to act when a situation happens.

The benefit a student would get from online school wouldn't really be a benefit but would be a crutch. A child shouldn't have a reason to stay home all day and take the classes at home. Social skills that are required for day to day life would end up being forgotten, learning wouldn't be as unique as it is in a real classroom, and a set of morals would only be tailored for that individual instead to thinking about how others would feel.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4856BA67958F,"Some schools nowadays offer distance learning classes or classes that you can take at home which some people think could be revolutionary. I believe that the distance learning opportunities for students will actually hinder the students ability to learn as much as they could in a real school scenario. Attending classes at home gives the student more freedom, like learning at their own pace, but his freedom could be a good thing and also a bad thing. Taking classes at home does not benefit the students because it creates more opportunities to cheat on their work, it limits their social interaction with other people, and at home classes dont have the benefit of a teacher directly helping you in person.

If a student were to take a class at home in their own room, there is no one stopping them from just searching up the answers. When students are doing work that they dont feel like doing or its too hard, some result to cheating. Cheating could be asking a friend for the answers, searching the answers up online, or just straight up copying from the internet. And if a student is given more freedom by taking classes at home, this opens up even more opportunities because they dont have to hide their cheating, the student just could be doing schoolwork or an at home test with an electronic device sitting right next to them. Some would say to trust the honesty of the student, but if the student has the chance to get a better grade on an assignment by cheating with no chance of getting caught, I believe the student will take that chance. I have seen experiences like this when a teacher gives a take home test, and when its due every student shows up with the same answers. Allowing students to do important work at home is also unfair because of how many more resources that an at home student would have compared to a student taking the class in school. The distance learning option for students will hinder their learning because it allows them to non-honestly complete their work, meaning that they wont really be learning anything.

Distance learning also doesnt benefit the student for future life by limiting their social interactions. A student that doesnt go to regular school and just takes online classes wont even have the opportunity to meet new people in their classes or make new friends at the lunch table. In my experiences kids that take a lot of online classes or are home schooled often join a sports team because that way they have some method of meeting new people and making friends. Kids need social interaction in order to prepare them for the future, high school classes where the teacher makes you do a introduction in front of the whole class might be embarrassing, but it opens you up to not being scared in front of a large group of people. High school is supposed to prepare you for college, in which some colleges make it mandatory for freshmen to live in the dorms, so if you took online classes throughout high school and now your faced with 10 times the amount of people that were in your high school it can overwhelming. There is also the factor of working in groups, which is something a job might require, working at home by yourself doesnt prepare you for that or even have opportunities like that. Even still in high school group projects help everyone succeed by learning from each other and getting new ideas from your interactions with your peers. Attending online or at home classes wont prepare you for the future because you wont have as much social interaction with other people which is a key factor in growing up and becoming an adult.

Some online classes will teach you by having a pre-made video of the teacher going over the material or even just a power point with the information, and that does not benefit the student at all. Students need to be engaged in their learning if they want to do good, so this means asking questions and getting help from the teacher. If the video is pre-made the student cant ask any questions about the subject to the teacher because they dont have a real teacher. This greatly hinders the learning ability for the student as all they can do is hope that they understand the material and watch the video or go through the slides. When a teacher is teaching and I dont understand something I dont raise my hand while shes still teaching but I wait for the 1 on 1 help because that is what I can learn from the most. If you are at home you dont have that opportunity to ask all those questions or to get direct 1 on 1 help from the teacher. Being in person and hearing someone explain something to you is way easier then hearing it over a laptop or computer, in person the teacher can uniquely explain something just to you. Like in math, having a teacher write on your paper and point out the mistakes that you made is really helpful, but without having a direct teaching scenario that cant happen. Having a teacher directly next to you rather than over a screen will benefit you way more.

Taking a lot of online classes during high school will actually hurt you more than it helps you. Attending classes from home doesnt benefit you because it will allow students not to do work based off their own merit(cheating), it doesnt prepare you for future social interactions, and there is no direct teaching from a teacher in online classes. When you at home taking class by yourself no one is their to stop you from cheating, which will hinder your learning. No social interaction will not prepare you for your future life like college. Direct teaching, like in person teaching, is the most beneficial for a student, but with online classes you dont get that. Some people might say that online classes allow you to work at your own pace or students are more comfortable at home, which is true, but that also allows for laziness. In conclusion schools offering distance learning for students is actually not beneficial for the student.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
DB7C2E4235B4,"Some people might think students would benefit from home schooling and others might think the opposite. Doing home schooling has its own pros and cons but, I believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes at school where they have multiple of resources to help them rather then at home where they only have a few. Students can learn a lot from a teacher explaining everything to them physically then them trying to figure everything on their own. They have someone watching over them making sure they understand everything. Students have different facilities at school then at home. Some students stay after school with teachers to get a better understanding in subjects they need help with, while students who do home schooling don't have this opportunity. Every student should make use of the resources they receive to help them improve academically.

Students who do home schooling might not understand what they are learning. They don't get to ask question as much as students who got to school do. They would have a hard time understanding which will caused them to copy answers from online. Which won't teach them anything. Students could easily cheat on test or quizzes. Studying at home would get in the way of opening up and meeting new people and will also cause them to be shy and have a lack of communication skills. They won't learn to be an independent person which can affect them in the future. You need to be able to both communicate and be independent to survive in the world we're entering. Although online classes give you some resource in which you can ask a teacher if you need help with something but it's not the same as asking a teacher face to face. Students might have a hard time communicating with a teacher through emails. Some might not be able to afford to pay extra money for courses and a teacher who would help you through out the course.

Students would be lazy and would not think much of studying when at home. Being lazy all the time is not good for one's health. Students would waste their time playing games and watching moves on their phones. they won't pay attention academic studies instead, they would do other things at home; anything that has nothing to do with studying. Not understanding what one's learning can cause their grades to go down which also effects their GPA. And without a good GPA it's hard to get accepted into a good collage. Being at school gives you an opportunity to go and talk to different people which can teach you a lot about the world around us. It can build up communication skills that people need in order to survive.

Students should attend classes at school rather then at home because having a person physically be their to teach them, can help them in different ways. It can teach them way more then they can accomplish at home. A person who would disagree would say, students would be more comfortable at home. They would learn better at home with no one disturbing them when studying but, a person who is in their comfort zone all the time wouldn't learn to be independent and too much comfort can cause a person to be lazy. I agree with the fact you can study better when no one is disturbing you but not all student willingly want to study they need someone telling them what to do. That is why students should attend classes at school instead at doing home schooling.

I Have never done home schooling but, I have friends who has. Her name is Generic_Name, we used to go to a private school together until her parents decided to have her do home schooling. Generic_Name and I haven't talk to each other for two years now. She doesn't have a cell phone and her parents are strict; which made her cut off communication with everyone. I think people can can anxiety disorder being locked up at in their houses. Some kids might not even want to do home schooling but they have no other choice but to follow their parents choices. It can affect them in various ways causing them to have personality disorder or anxiety. Home schooling can also some students stress because studying alone, figuring everything own your own and not know what they are doing can be really stressful. People have a lot of other things going on other then studying in their lives so, they need to get out a breath some air and school is a good place to take load off their chests. You have people you can talk too and help you if you need anything. This is the reason why I believe attending class from home wouldn't benefit you as much as attending them at school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F683D9D28CE7,"With the thriving success of evolving technology, there is no question as to why schools shouldn't also keep up with the time. The idea of online learning as an alternative to in-school learning is very new. This may be the start of something revolutionary that contributes to the process of learning. Therefore, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class because it is a faster alternative, an easier way to learn, and students are able to pace themselves.

Distance learning may be a faster alternative for students who are currently enrolled in normal schools. With experience from the Generic_School Hybrid Program, there is not as much content within these virtual classes. With less work it would allow for students to complete classes faster. There would also be a lot less stress put into completing these assignments, which would allow them to complete this work at ease. Working ahead could also be another possibility. Proactive students love to complete work earlier to reduce stress that may come in the future. By working ahead, students are able to learn the material provided a lot faster; which would reduce the amount of time needed to complete a course. As time goes on, we strive to complete certain tasks at a faster speed, therefore, distance learning may be a perfect alternative.

A new way of learning may also allow certain students to learn at more ease. Certain learners may classiy themselves as visual learners; those who need to see something to learn it. With the lack of a live lesson conducted by a teacher, a visual such as a PowerPoint or video would be provided. With the presence of these factors, visual students may learn more easily at home rather than in school .Also, with the fact that there would not be other students involved in the classroom, it could eliminate the factor of distraction. For some, it is difficult to learn with others who are disruptive. Therefore, the elimination of this problem would allow students to learn without distractions, reducing their ability to learn. Students have no choice as to what they are exposed to in a classroom environment, therefore, a visual and calm environment may benefit them.

By doing these courses at home, students may be provided the opportunity to pace themselves. Teenagers have very busy lives that include sports, jobs, and chores. Therefore, by being able to pace themselves, they would learn the material but also be allowed time to do their other activities. It would be a perfect balance of school and other activities. Along with balance, students would also learn the importance of time management. They would need to reserve time in order to complete these assignments in a timely manner. Time management is a skill that may benefit those who may acquire certain jobs in the future. Allowing one to pace them self would help them learn the skill of time-management and how to balance their lives with school

With the advancing times, virtual school has become a possibility for a few students around the world. If one had problems in a normal school facility, online school should be a possibility to consider. These problems which a lot of students suffer from include distractions, time consumption, and difficulty learning. Therefore, the choice of enrolling in distance learning options should be offered at schools because they are a faster alternative, an easier way to learn, and they allow students to pace themselves.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
C6171901DBA7,"For the average, 21st Century American, technology has vastly changed day to day life. Machines have taken up some of the work in manufacturing goods, Cars are starting to drive themselves, and theres even an app that can deliver a Big Mac to your door in under a half an hour. If society has evolved into a world of technology, why not let that technology change the way our kids learn for the better? Students would be better off with having an option for online education, because it would provide for a more flexible way to learn, a ""Plan - B"" in the case of a long term school closure, and another option to receive an education for children in unfortunate situations.

For some kids, going through the typical 8am to 4pm school day can feel pretty monotonous. Even your average core class tends to have lots of downtime that makes students wonder, ""why am I even here?"" With an online education, students who hate wasting their time are able to move through curriculum at their own pace, and whenever they see fit. No more sitting in a florescent lit room wondering if whether the asbestos or the sheer boredom will kill you first. Instead children will be able to set their own parameters for how to get through the days course load. Online school has the potential to bring efficiency to the forefront of education.

Another issue that becomes for and more relevant by the day is how education in America is supposed to continue in the case of a long term school closure. It has become increasing likely that the United States will end up closing all public schools due to the widespread intensity of the Novel Coronavirus. The virus has already infected around one thousand people in the US and that number is likely to rise exponentially. In the case of a massive school closure, an online option for public education would be a clever way to keep education in America from grinding to a halt. A close to normal way of life for the foreseeable future will almost certainly require an online education.

Finally one issue that an online education could partly remedy is how kids with unfortunate home lives properly receive an education. With the flexibility of online schooling, Older students who happen to live in poverty would be able to have a job during the day to bring money home to their families, While still getting a good education when they are off the clock. An online school would also help children with chronic illnesses or disabilities as students and parents would be able to structure the childs' schooling to fit with the needs of that specific child, resulting in a more personalized and thus more useful education.

While some might argue that online school could stunt the development of social skills for some children, I would make the case that, while online school certainly isnt for everyone, having an option for students to choose the way in which they learn makes the idea of school far more appealing for most students. Online learning provides for an efficient, flexible, and safe way to learn, and every American should have the option to be a part of it.               ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
C8D3EB90EB29,"Do you ever want to skip school and stay at home? As a kid, I have always wanted to take classes at home so I wouldn't have to go to school; however, now that I'm older, I realize that taking classes at home wouldn't benefit me. Coming to school and taking classes at school has been extremely beneficial for me. Schools offer a great counseling program that has helped me through various problems, I can't imagine how my life would be if It wasnt for the help of my counselor. Some say that taking online classes at home is beneficial, but it is not, taking classes at school is the best option and is beneficial because students have a one on one experience with their teachers, students have a better social life, and builds character.

Having a one on one experience with your teacher is extremely important, but if a student takes online classes at home, they wont be able to experience that. Teachers are always there for help: if a student, after taking notes, still doesn't understand the subject, a teacher could go one on one with the student and help them understand. On multiple occasions, I couldn't understand a subject until I had a one on one time with the teacher. According to Harvard University study, 78% of high school students need a one on one time with a teacher to understand a subject. Teachers have a special way in making students understand. This is why a student won't benefit from taking online classes at home because there will be no teacher to help one on one.

Also, being at home all day taking classes does not benefit with having a good social life; however, coming to school exposes a student to many other students that could potentially lead to having more friends and a better social life. According to multiple studies ran by Cornell University, 48% of students who take online classes are socially off. My brother took classes at home for the first two years of high school and he did not have any friends. When he started going to school for classes, I could tell that he was much happier. He had multiple friends and was socially better. Thats why a student doesn't benefit from taking classes online because its not good for a students social life.

finally, taking classes online does not build character because it doesn't expose students to the real world; however, school on the other hand, exposes a student to many real life situations that sets students to graduating and going out in the real world. My family and I have noticed the difference in my brothers character when he used to take online classes at home compared to going to school. My brother was not confident and did not have much common sense since he was home all day; however, since he started going to school he has became more confident and has more common sense. By going to school, I personally have learned many life skills that build my character. This is why taking online classes isn't beneficial because it doesn't build a students character.

some may say that taking online classes at home benefits a student because students have less distractions; however, it doesn't benefit a student because what they can experience and learn is extremely limited. Imagine being home almost all day taking classes, a students life would be miserable. Would a student be able to handle going to college if all they were used to is taking classes at home? Are students who have been socially awkward their whole life because they took online classes handle going out in the real world? ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

There are also other types of way to attend classes at your home. For example, taking it online and video conferencing with your teacher and others from that school. And it is much more easier in a regular school.

Firstly, taking classes at home is much more comfortable than taking classes at school. Therefore, you can relax, not be tense, and not being afraid to ask questions. It is much easier to handle than a regular school.

Secondly, you're much more focus there are no one to annoy you, making such noise, or hearing somebody else talking about other stuff whether it is important or not. It is much more quieter than any of the room you've been in and your head is on the right point.

Thirdly, you don't need to worry about troubles unless you're slacking no, i'm talking about bullies those brats who always pick on the weak. Their head is not the right pont where they por they're anger all to you.

And others would say that taking classes from home can take your mind off from your objective. Because they're distraction if you have sibling and when you just can't really focus when you play games all the time and watch tv.

In conclusion, studying at home instead taking classes from a real schools can alson be hard there's really no one that you can depend on except, you have a teacher on your house now, thats much more easier.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
BCAE5B0783CF,"The way we tech is constantly evolving, technology is a big part of that evolution. Technology has helped us make learning become faster and less reliant on teachers. Technology can also help with leaning outside of the traditional classroom. Something that could be a big help for the schools allowing for students to attend classes from their own home. Attending classes at home isn't a new idea, it has been around for a few years now in certain school districts, not to mention with homeschooling. Students can benefit from this if they're sick and or injured where they really can't go to school, or kids who work better in better environments than the traditional classroom, or even the people who just don't want to go into school to do classes they can do from the comfort of their own home.

People get sick or injured often, sometimes it can be so bad they're put on home bound which is when they aren't supposed to leave their home to go to school normally. In those cases the students could benefit from taking online classes. Online classes allow kids to work at a pace that is comfortable for them and if a student had a question they could have a call with their teacher to clear anything up they didn't understand. Another thing that is beneficial is being able to have a group call to do classroom specific learning, like calling the student to work with their classmates via the call, or calling together other kids in similar situations to recap with them what happened in their classes.

Classrooms are for most people a great way to learn a topic, others can have difficulty learning in such an environment. With the rise of mental health awareness in the past few years, and being able to identity kids who might be special needs, some schools haven't done enough to make those kids comfortable in a learning setting. Some kids might find it easier than others to work in a classroom, the other kids who find it more difficult should be able to take classes in their homes. This innovation could make it so more kids could be integrated into the public schools, especially if we hired teachers for their needs and allowed then a safe place for them outside of the normal classrooms. Something like this could be a huge step forward into more open and accepting schools.

Unlike the other two points this is a bit more up to the parents and school. Students who may not want to work in classes should be able to have a choice to work from home. This would be very close to home schooling, but it could allow the kid to be more involved in their school. An example of how this could work is one day a kid could go to school for a certain amount of classes and the next day take all their required classes online. The classes could be taught by teachers with the county or teachers specifically hired for such a thing. This would allow kids to have more free choice with how they receive their education. This is seen in some counties around the state, where special centers are created for kids who want to do something other than traditional schooling.

All these reasons are why potentially having online classing and video calls from home as a form of education could be really beneficial. Not only will it give the kids more options on how they learn but also create a change to your typical classroom. If you were to offer this to most students today they'd agree because this could be the future of the school systems in America which have been the same for decades. Schools around the world have been constantly changing the ways they teach to help better adapt to how the students learn best. This change might also raise the rate of graduation and lower drop out rates in our schools. Change is inevitable and we should go with it instead of allowing our teaching methods get stuck in the past. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7BC73C8FBDBC,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated.

Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they don't want to work.

some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school.

Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it won't have distractions that a online has. However, Students won't lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school.

Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers won't helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didn't know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time.

In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they won't be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldn't make you stressful. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
750AFA674F45,"I think students would not benefit taking online classes or videos conferencing from home. Students not learn to much because they do not receive a good explication about the class as a real teacher would to explains in the school, not have rulers and online classes not catches the students attention.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them.

Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

Some say that taking online classes or videos conferencing from home is a benefit for students. They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. Other say that online classes or videos conferencing explain in good details.. They are wrong because real teachers explain better than online class or videos conferencing.

As you can see, taking online classes or videos conferencing from home, not helps the students to learn because if they are confusing they will get bad grades , nobody answer their question or doubts and they don't have rulers or limited to use any electronics devices. This is not a benefit for students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FD607B909E07,"A college study states that students are five times more productive when they work from home. This means that students would benefit from attending class from home. The reasons for this are, students are in a more relaxed environment and are less distracted by other peers.

When students have to leave home everyday and be around so many people it can get a little overwhelming. Meaning they are being put out of their comfort zones. This can cause them to show poor results in the classroom. One student said"" While they attended school they were a straight C student, but when they began homeschooling their grades significantly increased."" Later a parent stated that there kid had never been comfortable around large groups of people. This could have been avoided by removing that student from that stressful situation and allowing them to be home in a controlled environment.

It is a well known fact that students are distracted by their peers. This means students are missing important parts of class by talking with other students or watching other students do silly things in class. Taking these kids out of school, and leaving them at home to attend class makes them isolated from their peers giving them no distractions from others. This also allows their full attention to be on their work. This makes them more productive and able to take in more information.

When it comes to being comfortable or distracted at school these things all add up to one thing, limitations placed on students being able to learn at school. These things seem minor but they each play a role in students academic successes and can be avoided if you allow your student or child to learn from home. Being able to learn from home is a very beneficial idea that schools and teachers must take advantage of.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
75F898F291C7,"The students of today are the future of tomorrow. Students need a good education to be the next leaders of the world. People will look up to them one day and they will need to be educated correctly. Having the correct education and correct learning environment in can go a long way. Although some may disagree, active learning and friendships proves that online school will not benefit students.

Active learning is only possible by meeting in person and having the pleasure of talking to them face to face. For example, students tend to learn better when they are actively learning in a classroom with less distractions. I, myself, tend to get distracted fairly easily with my phone. Last week during my physics class I was on my phone and I missed an important date. The teacher did not repeat it because I was not paying attention. Teens attention span is not that long and when we get put into our own home it is an overall distraction. Another example of how active learning is better at school is for the teachers. Eariler in the month I was struggling in my math class and the teacher came up to me to see if I needed extra help because she noticed I was struggling. If I was to be in online school then the teachers would not notice I was struggling because they cannot see me. Active learning is the best form of learning.

While on the topic of communication between teacher and students, friendships are a lot easier to make while attending school. For example, I have met a lot of new people at school that do not live close to me. I would have never met one of my best friends if it wasn't for school. School brought us together by letting us see each other everyday. Online school could dis encourage friendships because students are not meeting new people. Another reason why friendships are a lot easier to make attending school is because of sports. High school and middle school sports are a way for teens to engage in school activities. I have met a lot of new people through high school baseball and basketball because they share the same interest as me. Meeting people that enjoy the same things as me is just a conversations starter, which leads to friendships. Friendships and the feeling over being included is just as important as school.

Some may believe that online school is better because the people who have a hard time in school by getting bullied won't have that fear anymore. While thinking that way is reasonable, it is inaccurate because teens will always go through hardships and they will need to overcome that hardships. For example, Oprah Winfrey had a hard and gruesome childhood. She did not give up and has overcome all of her obstacles in life to get where she is today. Oprah is now one of the most influential women in the world and overcame all of her obstacles. Overcoming hardships at school can make individuals stronger as a person.

This is important because students need a good education for a good future. People in the past went to school everyday with no technology and had to learn in person. Since that way has been working, there is no need for a change. Students of the future can hopefully see how much more beneficial going to school is than attending online school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
E4B7DF413601,"Being able to attend class every day isn't always the easiest things for some students. Life just gets in the way sometimes. School also takes around 6 hours out of a students day which leaves them very little time to do anything else. One thing some schools are doing is offering students the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students could benefit if schools offered distance learning as an option because online classes eliminate the need for a student to be present in class, gives them more time in the day to do other important things and can even help teach a student some responsibility.

Giving the students the option to take classes online allows for them to still get work done and on time even if they are sick, have doctors appointments, or even have a family emergency.

Some students may even miss a few days to even a week of class leading to them having a large amount of work they have to make up while also doing the work that the teachers are currently assigning. Allowing students to take classes online can help students eliminate the physical attendance factor and lets the student work from nearly anywhere with a computer and internet connection. And having the ability to have classes online means a student can help reduce the amount of missing assignments which would overall help improve their grades.

Online courses also give the student more free time in the day to do other important things. For example, some students work jobs to try to raise money for college but often dont get paid very much due to the little amount of time they get to go to work. With the opportunity to take class online, a student can get most or all of their schoolwork done in a smaller portion of the day and still have plenty of time in the day to go work, take care of younger siblings, and tend to other important things. Most students have to sit in a school for up to 6 hours a day, but with the option of having online classes a student could get schoolwork done within a couple hours and have the whole day to do what they need to do. Being able to get schoolwork done in a smaller amount of time benefits students because it gives them more time in the day to do what they want or need to do.

One issue that one could argue against giving students the option to take classes from home is that some kids may not be responsible in doing their work because of distractions or lack of motivation because of a less structured environment. While this is true, it is the students responsibility to make sure their work is done and turned in on time, even in regular public schools. And while the online classes may be less structured, online courses usually have required times that a student must be active which would provide some structure for the student to get their work done. But having a less structured teaching environment could actually help make the student more responsible because the student will be given due dates and requirements that must be met, otherwise they would start to fail the course. And learning responsibility is a great thing for students as a way to prep for college and life outside of school. Having online classes as an option still benefits students, even tho less structured, it still teaches some responsibility.

Students are likely to miss a few days of school, and some work jobs and have to help with family income. The option for students to take their classes online is very beneficial to them. Life just gets in the way sometimes, but giving choice to take online classes can significantly help students. There isnt much of a downside to these forms of classes. Overall schools that offer online classes to students benefit them by giving them more time to take care of their own things outside of school, recover from illnesses, and inadvertently teach them to be a little more responsible.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
275D05200160,"Distance learning is becoming very popular in my generation. You can easily sign up for an online classes, or classes instead of having to actually go to school to learn. There can be many reasons for a student to do this, some students may not work well in the school environment, some students may have certain jobs so online school helps them to create thier own schedule, or maybe there is even a deadly viras going around and they have to put students in online school so they can get work dont from home. Taking online school can be very beneficial to students that desire to do so.

Some students out there don't enjoy the public school environment. Sometimes it is the teacher, the students around them, or maybe they are struggling with a disorder or a diseas. This is where online school can come in hand. Doing online school gives the student a safe place they can go where all they have to do is sit in their bed, open their computer and they are at school. You don't have to worry about the stress of not liking your teacher, or even how you are being treated. From personal expierence a handful of teachers that we have in our public schools today forget that they were like us once and had no idea what a certain topic was about, and probably even struggled with it. They often get frustrated with us when we don't catch on as quickly. Or they just try to get through lessons rather than teaching them. But with onlice school you are able to go at your own pace without having any trouble or distractions around you. Something that other students can also struggle with is bullying. For some, school is not an enjoyable safe place for them where they can freely learn without being bothered. Which of course is not ok by any means and if a student is stuggling with this they should tell an adult. But, there are cases where the student wants to be taken out of that environments, so that's where online learning comes in so they don't have to deal with the stress of everyone else and they can focus on their education. Now, there are also students that struggle with diseases and disorders. There are certain illneses that can cause you to be in the hospital for long periods of time, so you can't go to school, or school is not a safe place for you to be because of all the germs and crowded hallways. You can bring your computer anywhere and get all of your work done, which can take someones mind off of things and make them feel like they are working at something and to keep going. Online school is a safe place for students to learn and get their education without having to worry about anything else.

There are students that have to become the parent of the household sometimes, because they need more money, or they have an absent parent. This can put a lot of pressure on a kid my age. We don't really think too much about paying bills, or having to buy groceries, or worring about when our next pay check will come in. But, there are students out there that have to worry about that. They work two or three jobs to support thier family, which leaves little to no time for school. Online schooling gives you more free time because you are able to make your own schedule. You don't have to worry about waking up on time, then going straight to your job after school, then having to go home super late and get all of your work done. You can take your computer anywhere you want, at any time you want, and sit down and get your work done. This can take loads of stress off of a student that shouldn't be stressed out about things that we normally would relate to our parents stressing about, but at times some people get put in certain cercumstances.

Now, something that is going on right now is the Corona virus. This virus is spreading all around the world and killing many. So one place where most of us students get sick from is school. There are hundreds and sometimes thousands of students touching so many surfaces in our schools each day. These surfaces aren't getting disinfected every second of the day so this is why so many kids end up getting sick from school. In my area there have been 2 reported cases of the corona virus. Schools are now talking about closing the schools and putting us all into online classes since it will be a substantial time out of the classroom. Putting us in these online classes keeps us all caught up on our work from home. None of us will have to worry about catching this deadly diseas, and it keeps the teachers safe too. So doing the online classes is going to benefit us because we won't fall behind and have a huge load of work to do, and it takes stress off of teachers so they don't have to worry about having to teach us tons of lessons in a short amount of time.

So in conclusion having these online classes can really benefit all kinds of students in many ways. You go to class on your own time, from the comfort of your own home or wherever you may choose to do you work. Being a good student is something we all strive for, and none of us want any unwanted distractions. There is no need to worry about anything else around you. You are able to get your education, and succeed in an easy and comfortable way.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
32D85652B5AC,"Everyday, students enjoy themselves and learn new skills while interacting with their classmates. Not only is school a place to learn, the classrooms hold many children of the same ages who get the chance to communicate and discover new things about each other. Putting children in school is one of the most beneficial decisions a parent can make. Although many people believe distance learning from home is the most helpful way of learning because it better fits the busy schedules of children, learning in school is much more beneficial because children get the opportunity to learn and interact with others, students will not become dependent on technology, and kids will adapt to necessary time management skills.

To begin with, school may not be the most exciting time of the day, but it teaches many life skills used regularly. In the classrooms, students work together in teams to complete tasks and share ideas. Whether somebody is working in a job or purchasing something from the store, these necessary interaction skills are all taught in the early years of school. For example, if somebody completed their schooling online and was ready to go off to college, they would have a tough time getting around due to the fact that they have had no prior communication with other students. Completing school inside the classroom relieves stress from students who might be struggling on something while working alone online. Students who take advantage of learning in class together will learn important interaction and communication skills.

In addition, technology is increasingly becoming a part of everyday life for people all over the world. Children everywhere are being influenced by their screen, preventing them from focusing on the task at hand. In order for kids to stay kids, they must physically stay in school and not take online courses from home. While many kids are becoming well rounded and physically active with each other, some children are stuck at home taking online school through their computers. For example, the children in school will learn to do things on their own using their heads without having to rely on technology. Students who only interact with people through their screens will become more and more dependent on technology which can cause many problems down the road.

Last but not least, time management is one of the most important skills for people to have no matter what age they might be. The whole world is running on a strict schedule every hour of the day. When students attend classes in school, they get up on time, get themselves ready, and learn how to balance their busy schedules. Learning how to manage time at a young age is no easy task; however, students can master their skills by physically taking classes in school and preparing for life ahead. Children who take online school courses will struggle in the future to balance their time and live a life full of stress.

In conclusion, learning in school is much more beneficial for children because they get the chance to interact and communicate with others, they will not become reliant on technology alone, and they will learn necessary time management skills to be used everyday. When every child is enrolled into their school for class, they will be ready for the future and prepared for anything that life might throw their way. On the other hand, if children remain in online courses, they will struggle communicating with other people throughout their entire lives. Every student should be physically put into school to ensure a great future at this very moment.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

F4FD84517F40,"Schools are offering distant learning for students to attend classes off campus. Many students are saying this is great and they are taking the offer to continue and better their education. On the other hand, some say that this is not the best idea for schooling. Schools want to give students an opportunity to better their learning and stay connected with education. Online classes would help tons of students move closer to graduation and a better future.

Most of the people failing classes or didn't graduate the first time around have things they have to do outside of school to help support their families. A big example of this is working. They have to work to make money for their families but without all of the education they need, they can't work for a better paying job. Therefore, lots of people are working multiple jobs to support families; this is leaving them no time to spend six to eight hours of the day in a building. Another example is that nowadays many teens are having to stay home to watch their own child or watching a family member because of finances in their home. Although being home may help out with home situations, students grades are dropping due to the amount of absent days in classes. Online classes and video conferencing would benefit these students by allowing them to take classes at night and/or multitask during the day.

Another case where distant learning may come in use is for students very involved in sports. Doing a sport can be a big responsibility. Sports are very time consuming, although some athletes make it look easy, there is a lot that goes into playing. Many levels of sports may require leaving the state or country for days, sometimes even weeks. While playing a sport it is easy to be injured or become sick. Furthermore, students are loosing class time and unable to make up for missed days in little time. Distant learning would be beneficial for those who travel so they can take their school work along and manage their free time. Online classes also help when they are sick or injured to give them time to rest and heal and still not miss out on continuing to learning.

In conclusion, yes distant learning as an option to students is very beneficial. Allowing students to attend class from home or while traveling could get more and more people willing to go further in learning.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
ED74D2C2403B,"Sometimes take classes from home not can be helf students to improve their learning. Although some schools offer distances learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. I disagree to students take the classes on home because they not learn the same as in the school, if students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking, and Students did not have the same opcion like others students.

The students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. For example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting. Sincerity, take classes from home it is difficult for students the short learning because they not have the same capacity like others students. The students can be improve in the school more that from home, because from home they teaching they self. In addition, most of school believe that give classes from home can be helf students, but this is a big error.

If the students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking since, they answer themself. For example, sometimes the students do not know how to make homework, project, etc and they need someone to helf them. Also, every students need a teacher to explain everything that they need to make, and if they make the classes from home is impossible to make the thing good if did not have a teacher. It not the same to make the calsses online or in school because in online it is person who teaching for only a short moment, nevertheless in the school the teacher teaching for like 8 hours and helf in sonthing that students need. In effect, some students do not have capacity to make the classes from home, they needing to make the classes in the school to learn more.

Students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning. For example, most of them have a job and they not have the time to take the classes from home, because they lose the time in the job and when they going to the home they are tired and only going to sleep. While, the others students improve their life in the schools the others students who make the classes onlone not learn enything because they not have time. Make the classes from home it is not necesary for students because they can going to school every day and work after school and with this method they have more chance to improve they learning.

5C12763A0F7B,"Have you ever heard of being home schooled? Homeschooling is when the parent of a child, or sometimes even the child themselves, chooses for the child to be taught school materials right from the comfort of their homes. Another alternative is for a school to have video conferencing set up so that the student can be taught by a teacher from a school right at home. This style of learning could either be very beneficial or detrimental for the student in many ways. I believe that students could very much benefit from being able to attend classes from home online or through video conferencing because it's convenient, could allow for more direct learning from an individual teacher, and could even reduce stress for parents.

Being able to attend a class online from is very convenient because it could give the student more time to work and study the different subjects they'd have to take, while allowing them to have a level of comfort regular school just can't give to them. They wouldn't have to worry about being late for school, or having to walk if their parents weren't able to drive them if they lived far from their school. Overall, giving students the ability to take classes at home could play a crucial part in stress-free education.

Students could also benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows them to be taught directly from a teacher. There wouldn't be any disruptive classmates that distracted them, they'd be receiving the teacher's full attention. Allowing this would greatly improve the average student's overall academic performance, and would allow for many more creative and intelligent minds.

Allowing students to attend online classes would reduce stress on the parents as well. They would no longer have to worry about having to rush their child out of the house if they slept in too late, or was simply being too slow. Online schooling would simply allow the student to take more time with their classes, which would prevent parents from being stressed out about students.

On the other hand, some may say that allowing students to take online classes could have a negative effect on the student's social skills. While this could be true in some instances, I don't believe that school is the only place a student could be social in. There a plenty of other things that could play a key role in boosting a student's social performance.

In conclusion, giving students the ability to take online classes or have video conferencing is very beneficial, and has more positive effects than negative. Giving this privilege to students would not only take the stress off of them, but the parents, and even the teachers. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
E76B5F4C93C4,"Some schools were considering doing classes from home like online or video confrencing. This could change schools Heavily. Having the options to take classes at home would not benefit students because they dont need to pay attention they could put up the class and just walk away and also it would make it so many students would skip school all the time.

Having the option to take classes at home would not benefit the students because they wouldnt even have to pay attention. The main point of school is to educate kids and prepare them for adulthood, but how can Schools assure they are learning if someone isnt there to make sure there actually paying attention. Many teachers will make sure students are not on their phone and are actually paying attention but no one can assure that if the kids are at home. Finally if students didnt understand they would have no way of asking questions.

Next if students could simply take thier classes from home some students wouldnt ever go to school. If students were just skipping school and taking their classes online many students would not graduate. Doing this would just give students another reason to try and skip school daily. School is more than just learning information its also about learning important skills for life like responsibility, teamwork, and problem solving. Being able to take classes at home would make it impossible for some students to learn those skills.

Some people may say that having the option to take classes at home would benefit the students because it would give an option for kids who couldnt attend school that day to not fall behind. Many kids will get sick throughout the year or have a reason not to come to school and this would give them a chance to not fall behind.

Giving students the option to take classes at home would not benefit them at all because it would make it so kids could just skip school whenever they want and just because they have the class on the computer doesnt mean they are actually paying attention.

Finally In order for the students tp truely benefit they would need to really want to learn.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
451BE494A2C0,"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would be able to benefit from attending their classes from home because they could have fallen ill from a sickness that would generally prevent them from attending school, the student or students could have extreme anxiety issues to where they could faint after an anxiety attack from being overwhelmed by the abundance of people around them, and they would not miss any important information that will benefit them as well as their education.

First of all, like any school would, they encourage their students that if they are sick or not feeling as well as they should be, they are to stay home so they won't get sick others and most importantly to get rest. While they are out of school, they are missing class time. This class time could be very essential to them because, in class, the class could be going over some information that would be needed to pass a test. With this being said, the opportunity of being able to attend class from would benefit the students if they are sick should be given so the students would not miss out on test given information.

Second of all, Students with anxiety issues can get overwhelmed by the abundance of students and teachers around them. Them getting overwhelmed could cause them to have an anxiety attack and cause them to faint from it. By having access to being able to attend school from home, a student fainting from an anxiety attack would be prevented from happening.

Third of all, what if a student has important information from their instructor about something that is upcoming in their class? The student would not be able to get the information that could benefit them because for some reason they would not be able to attend school. If their school adopted a distance learning program, they would not miss the opportunity of gathering this important information from their instructor because they have the opportunity of being able to attend class from home.

In conclusion, schools offering distance learn would benefit every student attending school because a student could be sick and staying home would mean they would be missing class time, students could have bad anxiety and would get overwhelmed while at school because of the large amount of people, and if a student is unable to attend school for a specific reason, they could miss some important information that their instructor needs to give them that could benefit them and their education. While most would be in favor of this idea, other may find that distance learning by way of online or video conferencing could detach students for from society, the students won't be able to participate in essential hands on activity, and won't get the overall full school experience. This rebut to the distance learning program should not deter any school board official or any person from being in favor of this beneficial tool for enhancing the opportunity of learning. All in all, every school should invest in a distance learning program for their students, for it will benefit the school and most of all the students.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
76B1E5A86F75,"In the 21st century, the world has become increasingly digitized. This has allowed people to communicate with greater ease and from further distances. An example of a part of daily life that uses more and more technology is the education system. Many classrooms are beginning to offer information via online. Despite the limitations of an online classroom, it will benefit students by offering them flexibility and by preventing them from falling behind.

Due to the nature of online learning, it will offer students more flexibility in their learning. If the student wants to learn the information face-to-face with the teacher and ask any questions they might have, they can do so. On the other hand, online education allows students to complete their school work from the comfort of their own home if they are unable to attend class for any reason. For example, in the event that a student becomes ill and has to stay home, it allows that student to be caught up on the work that they missed.

Another benefit of online education is the ability to help prevent students from falling behind in class. There are many scenarios in which a student can end up falling behind on their school work or in their understanding of a subject, even though the teacher must keep moving on with the class. For example, if a student must stay home for an extended period of time due to an illness, then they can remain caught up on what the class is learning through their online classroom. Additionally, if a student feels that they do not understand a concept that was taught and was unable to ask questions to the teacher about it, then they would be able to use the different resources offered by an online classroom to gain a better understanding.

On the contrary, the online classroom does have some limitations. Firstly, not every student may have access to internet at their home. Other students may have spotty connection at best or limited amount of screen time. However, in this scenario the potential to do good outweighs the restrictions. For students that have issues with online learning at their home can still meet with their teacher to discuss any problems they might have or workarounds to solve it.

In the age of technology, its integration into everyday life is inevitable. One aspect that is beginning to become digitized is the classroom. While critics may point out its restrictions, the online classroom will give students more accessibility from home and help them stay on top of their missed work. Besides, public education has remained largely unchanged since its inception. Wouldn't it be a waste to not use technology to its benefit?",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
BF7C67E62F30,"Ever since before the modern-era, there have always been different ways to teach. Whether this teaching was through disciplinary actions, or through work-heavy courses, the ways of teaching have been evolving and continuously adapting to the needs and wants of the typical student. As long as the student is learning, there should be no reason to oppose an idea that would benefit that learning capability. Because of this, opposing the idea to learn from home through online classes or video conferences would be absurd and hinder a student's performance who benefits from learning at home. The positives outweigh the negatives tremendously which should leave no room for doubt on the issue.

As we advance deeper and deeper into what is the 21st century, emotional problems seem to have a bigger impact on the public than they did 20-30 years ago. There was once a time that coming out to say you had depression, anxiety, or any other type of mental issue would be looked down upon and receive little to no medical attention for it. But as technology advances, mental problems are now ""see able"" through the human eyes. One consequence of a mental problem would be social issues. With the younger crowd, these social issues tend to spill into the classroom leading students to not participate, or even miss class completely. Whatever the reason may be, a classroom outside of the social norms of a typical classroom would be extremely beneficial towards a student who may not learn as well in that setting. Not only would there be a rise in grades, online-attendance, and more, the student would work in a stress-free environment. Being able to escape the problems from the typical classroom is just one of the few reasons online learning should be something to cheer on and not look down upon.

Learning in a classroom can have it's benefits; however, sometimes distance learning is just exponentially more beneficial and convenient to the student. One of these conveniences would be just timing and classwork overall. As a student myself, being able to have one of my required classes online is extremely convenient. Not only do I save an extra year of high school, I'm able to take the course side by side with my already packed schedule. I'm confident there are various students on the same boat as me who find online schooling much more convenient. Moreover, not only am I able to learn the material at my own rate, I'm able to learn the material and successfully test out of it without dealing with a biased or grumpy teacher. Being able to complete a week's worth of schoolwork in the matter of a Saturday morning is no more than time saving and allows for me to complete other schoolwork fro various classes without worrying about having to sit in a slow classroom and learn the same material. The overall convenience is why students would absolutely benefit from being able to take classes at home.

The last and final reason I believe students should be able to use distance learning as an alternative to classroom learning, is something that will get their future started as young and as soon as they want. Whether they'd like to take a simple arithmetic online course, or an advanced calculus course, the options and tools would be out there completely. The best and brightest teachers are starting to use platforms like YouTube or Khan Academy to share their tips and tricks on how to solve even the most advanced mathematical equations. These types of tools would benefit students to where they could learn the material quickly and easily from home, and then get back on their path for their future. Instead of having to cram loads or work in the four years of high school, students are able to use the morning for schoolwork, and then participate and really learn skills and crafts that are required for the future. A perfect example of this would be any online gamer who is still in school. Instead of wasting useless time on busy-work, as soon as these students finish their online class, they're able to hone in on their skills and produce content that kick starts their career. Another example of this, would be a ""TikTok"" star who still wants to get a degree, but also likes and benefits from pushing out content every hour or so. By being stuck to the restraints of a classroom, they're able to produce material that helps them financially and educationally.

Regardless of how someone views distant learning, the benefits are clearly visible. The practical implications into having online schooling are endless and can benefit students who don't like or aren't able to be stuck to the restrictions of the typical classroom. The benefits whether emotional, financial, or time-saving, all play a part as to why I believe distant learning is beneficial and produces endless possibilities. Learning from home is just another approach to learning that has adapted from the needs and wants of the modernizing student.                              ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
EB1500B8EA75,"Some students who live far away from their schools; they prefer to attend classes from their home instead of going to a school, attending classes from their home can affect some students education and affect their live in a future beacuse not all of the students who are taking online classes are going to complete their work .In my opinion I think is a bad idea to attend classes from your home because students can get distracted for anything, not complete their work and get bad grades.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated. One day I went to her home like at 6:00 pm after shool and she was working in her online class, but honestly Generic_Name was not really woking in what she suppose to be working on, yes she had her cumputer on and her online class open , but she was getting distracted by the her tv show just because she like the beaty and the best she stop doing her work. My friend Generic_Name she suppose to do her work but she always got distarcted by her tv show, if she had deside to turned off her tv she didn't got distarcted by anything and she could be success in her online class.

Students who attend classes from their home as there is anyone who is reminding them to completen the work some of them forgot to get it done and they had an incomplete work. This year I am taking an online class and sometimes I forget that I have to be doing all my requested assingments, and by the end of last week I got a bad score because i didn't complete my Vocabulary assingment. If I had put a alarm every day to remind me that i have tostudy and complete my asssiments i could get a better score.

Some others will say that attending classes from home can be a good idea because they can work on in any time,however,others may say that is a bad idea beacuse they can get bad grades. Some classmate that are taking online classes they aren't reading all the directions that the class is giving ;they are just doing the work without reading and that can affect their grades. Having bad grades can made you to not pass your school year, but if we efort we can be great.

For some students is consider to take online classes, but in some point can affect them in their education. There are many students who have online classes and they are falling because they dont have enough help, and some of they because they are not doing it .If schools provide after schools help for online classes will be helpful for all student who needed to be more success, and feel more confortable while they are doing their work and also teachers to be cheking if students are able to pass.     ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
D231A669B482,"About 60% of students have a hard time catching onto lessons taught by another person and having a way to better understand or they have social anxiety and can't be around people without feeling uncomfortable or panic. Most students will be able to learn better in an environment they feel comfortable in. For an example, their own homes that way they aren't as anxious. Although, Most parents believe actual school is better for students because they might have a better chance in getting higher education and better jobs. Some students will benefit from online classes because it is less stressful, better learning environment and opportunities, and they have a better sleep schedule than they do in actual schools.

To begin with, students benefit from online classes due to it being less stressful. In schools the teachers make a short time period on assignments and have close deadlines which causes students to stress about getting them in on time. For example, english teachers give esssays and most of the time only ONE class period to finish them, but in some schools you dont have long class periods like middle school you get about 30 minutes each class everday for 7 periods. Deadlines can cause stress due to it being so close and not having enough time to begin and finish your work. Even with missing school days it takes away from your time to get your work finished on time but most teachers wont allow you to get more time. Online classes give you enough time to make up and finish your work so that you are stressful and not panicing about turning in late or missing assignments. They also allow you to get enough time to begin work and finish it. Unlike actual schools, online schools are flexible with your outside of school schedule.

Furthermore, better learning opportunities and understanding. Most students cannot learn by being taught by a fellow classmate or teacher. For example, student athletes might not catch onto whats being taught unless its demostrated by their sport. Students can learn by using their hobbies or even visual productions to understand what they are learn or being taught,but most students might enjoy learning and teaching themselves the lesson they are giving. From a students perspective notes are better taken when they are giving the documents and lessons to them and they take them theirselves rather than a teacher handing them a note sheet. For some students visual examples or lessons are easier for them to catch onto unlike a paper giving to them. Other students learn quickier when they can relate their hobby or sport to what is being given to them . Onlne classes allow you to learn in the way that you can better understand.

Last, online classes allow you to have a better sleep schedule. Actual schools can cause lack of sleep due to the stress students have from their assignments. Online classes allow you to get a good rest and a flexible schedule. These classes can be taken at anytime so that you wont have to worrying about staying up late trying to get everything done and losing sleep. You can take online classes in the morning or afternoon and in between you can nap or get rest so that you are not straining your brain. Lack of sleep can cause you to lose focus so it is very important that you have a good nights rest. Online classes make it easier to sleep at night because classes dont run late and assignments dont have close deadlines. Classes taken online give you enough time to almost finish or finish assignments so you are not up all night stressing and rushing through to get everything done and on time.

In conclusion, online classes are a better benefit for students. Students benefit in more positive ways from online classes. Students can benefit from online classes because they are less stressful, better learning environment and opportinies, and a better sleep schedule .",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7863164BA896,"In the American Public School system, education is primarily compromised of students physically attending their school and learning from teachers in person. However, with the rise of technology and the internet in the 21st century, students at most public schools are able to participate in learning both online and via video conferences, allowing them to effectively be educated from home. Distance learning in this way permits students to work on school subjects, even when away due being ill in some manner, and allows students with mental health disorders unable to attend classes the opportunity to achieve the same as someone attending school physically. Additionally, students working a job outside of school to support their family/self now have the opportunity to attend school from home/work and still be able to provide financial support to dependents/themselves. In short, distance learning is beneficial to students in public schools for students missing school due to sickness, mental health issues, and careers clashing with school scheduling.

The first and likely most prominent way in which students benefit from distance learning is the case in which they miss school for an extended period of time due to illness. Distance learning allows these absent students to still work on school subjects and stay on top of their work, while also reducing the risk of other students receiving the same illness due to the student continuing to attend school. Students attending school while still sick is a prominent issue in public schooling, caused by the lack of support for students unable to attend school. This issue would be eliminated due to the reduced need for sick students to continue attending school due to distance learning allowing students to stay at home while continuing to work on school subjects.

Another benefit for students from distance learning is the ability for mentally ill students unable to attend school due to disorders such as social anxiety, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and depression to continue learning outside of an environment detrimental to their mental health. Speaking from personal experience with family members and friends with mental disorders, public schools can often be a breeding ground for self doubt, anxiety, and general depression to occur for mentally unstable people, regardless of counseling opportunities available. Working on school subjects would allow for mentally unstable students to pursue their education, while also allowing them to maintain a healthy mindset in the comfort of their own home away from mentally unhealthy stimuli.

A final example of the benefits of distance schooling for public school students would be the opportunity for students working job/s outside of school to simultaneously pursue an education and support themselves or their dependents. Many lower class students or students with parents unable to work feel the need to obtain jobs outside of school, ranging from part-time summer jobs to full-time year-round jobs that inhibit the ability to pursue an education. Distance learning allows these students to do both at the same time if they have the desire to do so, instead of having to go to a program such as night school in order to catch up on work they usually do not have time to do. Distance learning essentially unlocks the ability for students working outside of school to continue to pursue academics while also maintaining financial balance for themselves or others.

To sum up, the opportunities for students with work hours interfering with school, mental health disorders or various illnesses are all benefits for the usage of distance learning within the American school system. Although some find distance learning to only further complicate the process of education for students due to some not having reliable access to WiFi or internet, different accommodations are usually available locally for students to use distance learning as a tool to further their education. Distance learning serves as a universal golden opportunity for students unable to attend school to continue to receive and education regardless of outside circumstances.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F7DFF6D988A0,"Imagine not having to go to school early in the morning to learn. Now a days, online schools are becoming more and more popular. It makes sense because technology is becoming more and more advanced, so why not make school more and more accesable to everyone? Certain people have bad mobility skills because of their disabillities, so being able to stay home takes away the stress of having to try get around a huge school. Being able to take classes online creates a better learning enviorment because it is cheaper for the schools and It is more acessable for people with mobility issues.

High School teachers have to teach about 25 to 30 kids each class and that means 25 to 30 copys of each book, each paper, and each textbook. All those materials costs schools a lot of money, but if a student is taking a class from home the teacher can just post it online and students can see everything saving the school money. When I was in 9th grade I missed a month of school because I had to go out of the country, but I still maintained my above average grades because my teachers just posted everything online. Posting everything online saved the school money because they didn't have to print all the papers I would have needed for that month before I left. With the school saving money from less papers and textbooks, they can put more money into things such as the library, sports, and teachers pay. Teaching more kids more efficentaly should be every schools goal and with online classes that can be possible.

A school should tend to the needs of every child, and every child should feel safe and happy at school. With this in mind, certain kids who have mobillity issues might not feel safe at school. Kids running around in the hallway and elevators sometimes breaking are risks students with disabillities take when coming to school. Also wasting all that energy getting around school might make some kids less content and not want to learn as much. When I was in 10th grade I broke my leg and had to get around on crutches and It was diffcult because I had to leave class early which made me miss important class time, the elevator would not work sometimes making me have to risk going down the stairs, and the fatigue from getting around just made me tired and not want to learn. If I could have taken online classes I would have because I could just accomplish all the things I did at school but from the comfort of my home. If all students had this option schools would see an increase in grades, attendence, and graduation rate. Taking online classes makes students feel more safe and sometimes way happier. Although students could make friends at school and learn real life social skills, they also might get bullied and become more shy.

Students are being more and more stressed as they increase in grade level, and If schools can do anything to take away some of the stress they should. Taking online classes has almost no negitives and so many more positives. Schools should be more inclined to make more classes available online which leads to schools being more efficent in teaching. Tell your school to make more classes available online!              ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
09ADB0629CD0,"Benefits of attending public schools

Imagine a child or student taking classes at home. How would his or her parents feel?

Would home school be helpful for their child? Is homeschooling important for thier child than public schools? Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas.

Attending public schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun. For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is a program in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate.

Not only schools let students become active in class, but also offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students study for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can give their best to answer student's questions.

Not only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others student's opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself.

In public schools, students can become active, can get information that they need, and let students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students. A student working alone with no partner, not being active, and not getting enough information from parents. Imagine a student being in that position. How would she or he feel? Public schools would be the best option for children. Imagine if every student went to school, their would be a positive change in their future. School can build student's knowledge everyday and to do it is by learning. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7F63036D0C59,"Inflexibility is one of the most common sources of failure for most people in large organizations. Public schools happen to be classified as large organizations, so the statistic mentioned previously obviously applies. Many students have a difficult time at a physical school, whether it be from medical problems, social anxiety, or even if they are just away on personal leave. Advancements in technology have helped to solve these difficulties at school, such as: easily-accessible internet, affordable personal computers, and large-scale organization software like Microsoft's Office 365. These advancements make up a new kind of education: virtual schooling. Virtual schooling allows students to access the same education as physical students while being away from the actual school. Schools should utilize this new type of schooling for students who cannot attend school due to medical problems, students who are stressed by a public environment, and students who are away from school due to a large-scale world events.

Medical issues can frequently cause students to miss school and fall behind the other students in terms of their studies. While they are usually acquitted from late penalties, students with many health issues usually have to make up schoolwork on their own time, after the medical treatment has concluded. With online schooling, students can complete lessons and assignments while recovering from a treatment in the hospital, offsetting the amount of schoolwork that they have to make up for later. Without online schooling, recovering students do not really utilize their time in the hospital, usually using cellular devices or other forms of entertainment. However, with online schooling, students can utilize their time efficiently, to save time and effort that would hurt them later.

Along the lines on medical issues, some students have social or mental disorders that bar them from attending school like a neurotypical student would. Disorders like Social Anxiety or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can cause some students extreme stress under a social environment. Online school is a remedy for this, as it allows these students to access the same classes, but under a much less stressful environment. These students would also perform better online, as the negative stress that would otherwise affect their grades would be missing; therefore, with online schooling, students with social or mental disorders would perform better in terms of grades and attendance.

Large-scale world events can also cause students to miss school. With these large-scale events, it it usually large groups of students that are affected, with some events causing an entire school system to shut down. For example, in early 2020, there has been a viral pandemic of a certain Coronavirus, with Asia and Europe most affected by it. In Italy, school have been shut down across the country, including schools affiliated with the U.S. Military Overseas School Program. One high school that has been shut down has began to utilize online schooling with video chat features for lecturing. All students at the school utilize the online schooling program, so that their school year is not interrupted by the pandemic.

Although some schools still do not have online schooling options, the ones who do show massive benefits at little cost to the schools or students. Some might say that online schooling is just another expense to the school, although that argument has little foundation. Most software for online schooling costs very little and the local governments have no problem funding them. The benefits definitely outweigh the costs of online schooling.

As the world becomes more technologically advanced, online schools have become more prominent at a high school and college level. Online school provides education to those who cannot attend a physical school, whether it be from medical issues, social issues, or mental issues. Large-scale closings of school due to world events are also remedied by online schooling, keeping school going while the physical school is shut down temporarily. These benefits outweigh the minimal cost of online schooling. The low cost and high reward of online schooling definitely benefit both the student and the school.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
1BF239A971C9,"At School

Students should not do school at home because it will put them in this bubble that will make the stay at home classes feel secluded and will make them become an introverted person. I do not think that doing school from home through videos would be very effective because at school you are surrounded by people who are or have taken the same classes that you are and it is easier for you to ask for help at a school with the teachers being there.

By going to an actual school you would be experiencing everything that someone who goes to a school would. You would be physically sitting in the same class with your classmates. You get to know your classmates, build friendships, and relationships with the people that you meet. You will get to know your teacher in person and get to physically ask them questions in person. If I did school from i would miss out on a lot because I would be by myself and I would have no friends in my class. I would also have to meet people from outside or from different events having to do with school.

Another reason to go to school is that by going to a school you gain so many things, one of them being skills. Some skills that you gain would be communication skills. Being able to communicate is really important; not just in school but outside in the real world too.

At school you have to do projects, talk to classmates about school work or about school in general. later, after school the kids who did school from home our most likely going to go to a college where they don't offer the same things by providing video conferences and other things having to do with doing school online. They are not going to be used to being in the same room learning the same things with multiple people. For the kids who did go to school, it won't be a big transition for them because going to college will be the same as going to a high school. The only difference is that college is a higher level course and you have to start over and meet new people.

Some people may argue that learning from home is more effective and beneficial because it takes away distractions and it will help their kid become more independent. However, I still think that going to school is more beneficial because being at a school, you are surrounded by people who have taken the same classes and your teachers will be there physically so that you can ask them questions and build friendships with them and your classmates. You can also become an independent person at school because you have to be able to speak up for yourself, ask for help. Me, going to a school i have to become independent now that i'm growing up. I have to ask for help and be able to do things on my own.

Going to school is a great way to get to know a lot of people that you might not meet by random. A school offers a lot of different things, such as clubs, volunteer opportunities, and the chance to be on a sports team. If you did school from home you'd have to get permission and would have to do have your grades be good enough to participate. At home you are reliable for understanding the information that you are receiving from the videos and if you have a question you have to email or get a tutor because sometimes the teacher isn't available and you'd have to go off the notes you took and the videos that are available to you online. Therefore, going to a school is more beneficial because it has more opportunities to offer you and people to learn from in one building. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
AA079BC1923D,"Schools preach to always have the students best interest at heart, which they demonstrate on a daily. A way for schools to best show they care for their students personal lives is by providing the option of distance learning for those unable to attend school. Distance learning, the chance to take their studies wherever they go to ensure they are always learning and receiving their proper education, would improve the lives of many. A program like this would be the beneficial for the students who have struggled with having to place school on pause to deal with a life crisis. All universities and schools should work to implement this option for their students. Although some may believe otherwise, distance learning should be offered because it accommodates all of students varying situations and is available in easy access to all.

The first reason that distance learning should be offered is that it accommodates all of the students varying situations. Famous social media influencer Annie Leblanc opted to take distance learning after leaving her home state, Maryland, in order to travel to Los Angeles,California in order to work on her acting career. Annie, known for her family YouTube channel Bratayley, chose to embark on the journey of acting, and although she was successful booking a main lead role in the Brat series Chicken Girls, she was determined to also complete her high school education. The compromise that she was offered was online schooling or distance learning where she was able to complete her courses from across the country at any time of day, especially while on break on set. Another person who opted for distance learning when they were unable to attend school, is my twenty-two year old cousin Generic_Name who, through using Generic_School's online graduate program, earned her masters in Psychology. My cousin has always been a studious person who worked hard in school to always improve her education, and after graduating in the winter of 2018, decided she wanted to continue her studies by earning her masters degree. However, at the time she was a a full-time employee at the company Constellis where she worked a nine-to-five. She knew that actually attending classes on campus would be difficult to incorporate into her schedule, so when introduced to the option of online schooling, she was beyond delighted to be given the opportunity to complete her education in the way that best accommodated her situation. Giving students the opportunity to chose distance learning at times where life throws them a curve ball is beneficial for it helps the student to benefit from their time.

Distance learning being at easy access to all students is the next reason for why it should be offered. One of the requirements of graduation that a student must meet at Generic_School is completing a personal finance course at some point in their high school career. In order to meet my requirement I chose to complete the course online during the summer while I visited my grandmother in Generic_City. Being able to take the course online was ideal for me because I was able to work on it at anytime I desired, for I always had an accessible device on hand that I would take out whenever I had time to spare on the course. Distance learning was not only beneficial to me on those hot summer days, but also in the case of a harsh winter storm that led to an extended period of closed school. Since the Generic_School, the school I attended while living in Generic_City, chose to change their curriculum to it being offered via an electronic device, my homeroom teacher, Generic_Name, was able to continue our lessons easily during the three week long break due to the harsh snowstorm. Each student was able to access the the proper programs at home where they completed the assignments from the comfort of their beds. When it was time to return to school, the distance learning helped keep us on schedule, and we ready to continue from where the online classes left off. Distance learning is equally beneficial for the teachers as it is for the students because it can be offered in response to a situation occurring that is unplanned for.

Arguers of this debate would say that distance learning should not be offered to students because it would be easy for a student to become unmotivated if not put in a classroom where ones teacher is continuously monitoring their work. While this is understandable because the students would be in the comforts of their home rather than in a school building, and would be required to complete assignments that they otherwise would not if not forced to, this argument is false. Students would still chose to complete their assignments and meet the deadlines, for the work that they are completing would still be a grade. Personally, when I was required to complete my online personal finance course, I remained motivated and dedicated to earning high marks. What I understood from my situation was that this online course would be a test of my success, and I took it just as seriously as I would if I was completing the course at my base school. Students would be just as motivated, if not more, to complete their distance learning, for they would be given the chance to complete the course on their own time in a comfortable environment to them.

Distance learning should be a choice to all students for it accommodates their varying situations and is always at easy access to them. Society has evolved immensely throughout the last couple of years to were if a student was required to complete distance learning, because they are unable to attend a normal school, they would be surrounded by all the necessary resources for that to be possible. Students should not loose their right of education because life left them unable to be in attendance at school. Distance leaning would benefit these students greatly, so why would one not offer an alternative solution and help improve their lives if it is possible?",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
08B72DCFD859,"Have you experience taking online classes from home?

students who plans to take online classes from home they would have to learn to be more responsible and dedicated. Could students benefit by taking online classes from home,

Yes I think it would be fantastic idea taking classes from home, it would be a great way to learn without having to leave your house or worrying you wont get to school on time. Home school can get you more prepare by learning and working on time managment,by woking on time managment prepares you for future jobs. For example I have friend that does home schooling she tried going to a regular school but didnt feel comfortable her parents decided to try home schooling, she ended up loving it,she had more time do other activities, its a great idea because you could prevent bullying from happening.

Imagen not having to leaving youre home, students would have more energy because they wouldn't be as exausted. Cerain students have walk miles not matter the bad weather. If students take online classes they could get more sleep and finish there work faster. students would be able to concentrate. In school you get distracted a lot because you have friends next to you trying to talk or make caos also interupting the class.

Not having energy for school is a big factor specially for student who work and walk to school in the mornings.

if student dont have the enery to go to school learn they would not be able to get good grades. a clear example is myself having to wake up every morning at seven am and walking thirty min to school and also working every day is exausting not matter the weather. Its really hard trying to stay awake in the mornings after walking a certain distance. Thats why i would prefer online studying as well it would change my life completely and i would feel more ready to do work.

in conclusion online classes is a great way to study if you dont feel comfortable going to school.

I would take online clases its less tiring its a great rest having the time to do my work from home and expirience a new way to study.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
05A6C6DF86A9,"More than 60% of kids who do online schooling score an average of 250 points lower on the SATs than kids who go to school. Online learning isn't an effective way to gain a decent education and students would not benefit from it. First of all online education puts you in a learning environment that is not suited for learning. Secondly it disconnects you from your fellow peers that could've helped you when you were struggling to understand material. Finally it blocks off the essential skill development of how to work together and with other people. Online learning may be easier than real school but in the end it leaves you at a disadvantage and unprepared for college and life as an adult.

Learning at home through a computer may should nice but its not all what it seems. Learning can become increasingly difficult when your at home and not in a class room because when your at home it makes it very hard to focus as you now have access to all the video games, TV and any other form of entertainment. It also means you are not under any teacher supervision which allows you to daze off and easily be distracted by pets or younger siblings. Especially in our day and age where we have cell phones, you would always be able to go on your phone whenever you'd like consequently missing what little important information your being taught. Another important factor ,that most people don't even think about, is the fact that you lose all the connections with your fellow classmates who can be valuable sources of information.

With the loss of fellow classmates it can make an impact greater than most people think. Humans are social creatures which allows us to thrive when working and collaborating with one another. Now when your taken out of that environment and placed in an environment that forces you to do all the work alone it destroys your work speed and makes it far more difficult to process and absorb information because you don't have the different perspectives or incites your classmates could have given you. Not having classmates also could make it harder to interact with unfamiliar people because when your in class your always meeting and socializing with new and unique people, now being taken out of that your no longer exposed to any of these interactions meaning you would have to relearn these social skills which could be very challenging as a teenager which could lead to worse problems like being socially awkward. Without classmates you will miss out on key social skills that may show its scars further down the road of life.

Getting along socially with other people isn't a given, we spend up to 16 years in the class room together nurturing key social skills that we will continue to use throughout our entire lives. Now imagine what would happen if you were taken out of the classroom. The effects would be devastating, you would miss out on the social development you gain from schooling and it would cause turmoil. This would be such a massive problem because social skills are a key instrument to have when in the work place, if you not able to articulate ideas and information to fellow employees properly it would strip these what wouldve been bright employees to substandard workers not fit for upper management jobs. Along with this without the key development of social skills these student that did online schooling could appear unappealing to other people leaving them lonely which would turn into depression making that person live a sad and horrible existence.

Online schooling and courses is just not the way to gain a proper education and it does more damage than anything else. Because people need other people taking them out of the class room for even one year for online schooling can have devastating impacts on the student and it may take years to reverse the damage. Risking vital aspects of success like the development of social skills and the brain is just not worth the easy courses of online schooling and should never be implemented into school systems. It sets you up to be steps be hide your peers meaning you'll always have to play catch up. In the end online schooling isn't worth the all the struggles you'll have to face as an adult and in college and its my strong recommendation that you stay away from it.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DECECA25BCBD,"Not everyone learns the same way and because of that not every class should be taught the same way. Since schools were designed to educate people of all backgrounds it should also be designed to teach various subjects in different manners that would ensure a better learning environment. Because of this it's better to have a versatile school system that offers a variety of ways for a subject to be taught. Allowing the option of online classes could help ensure that students are able to learn in an environment that proves to be more beneficial to them. By having the option of online classes it could help benefit students because it's, increases time management skills, is more accommodating to their schedules, and it's less overwhelming than a traditional class.

Taking online classes would help to instill necessary time management skills that could help ensure a more productive present and future. Some students have a lot on their plate that he or she struggles to keep up with, so school tends to become an issue as they can no longer keep it all balanced. Having the option of online schools help them create a balance that wasn't there before so they're able to remain on track with all their goals. However, allowing a student to take online classes doesn't mean they're able to sit at home doing anything, but what it does mean is that the student will be help responsible for keeping up with their work as they progress through the curriculum. By being able to remain responsible and keep up with one's work it proves that he or she will be better prepared for adulthood and the future. Some question what would happen if the student doesn't time manage, but this is why he or she must fully evaluate if online classes would prove to be more beneficial to them.

Whether a student chose to take one online class or several, it would prove to be much more accommodating to students' schedules because it enables them to fit their classwork and lessons into their schedule versus having a predetermined schedule they can't keep up with. Not all students are able to focus on school alone because they have other things that require their attention. Things like jobs or more private things can occupy a permanent time period in one's life and cause constant conflicts with school, but by allowing students to take online classes it helps take away the stress of having to chose which necessity will receive their attention. Yet some still believe that school should be a student's only focus, but in some cases it's just not possible and by giving them the chance to create a schedule that works for them it helps better prepare them for the future.

By being removed from a traditional learning environment that a classroom provides, it also removes the sense of being overwhelmed and anxious that one can get from the stressors it permits. Other students, and in some cases teachers, can create a barrier between a student and learning simply because they've created an environment that makes a student feel he or she is unable to fully focus and get involved in the subject. When this happens the likelihood that a student will be successful in a course greatly decreases. By removing him or her from this environment it destroys that barrier and creates a new space where he or she is now able to learn without any interrupters. Some say that the sense of being overwhelmed can still occur if one isn't able to keep up with their work, but by using time management skills he or she should be able to truly excel.

Students today are the leaders of tomorrow and because of that they should all be given each and every opportunity to excel. At no point in time should a student be denied something that would help them be more progressive in their track to graduating. By allowing schools to provide a versatile way of teaching materials, we guarantee to students that they're the first priority when in school, and that their needs are just as important as others wants. By taking a stand today and helping students everywhere be able to learn as they see best fit, the world is ensuring a better world for future generations to come. The world deserves a better future and that starts by allowing students to have a better one.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
9E4100586EDC,"Distance learning is a good thing because it allows kids who can't come to school a chance to get education. This could also become a casual tool that allows kids who missed school to get and stay caught up with their classes. People all over the world could benefit from this new form of technology.

Sometimes as a person with high anxiety, I dont like school because of all the loud and compacted areas. With distance learning this allows me to be able to focus somewhere and feel safe. This also goes with anything else as well, you dont have to have anything wrong with you to use it. Maybe you wake up one day and realize today isn't a good day, not an issue call in do what you gotta do and attend class online.

People who attend school regularly can benefit too. Say you miss a day or two of school due to the flu, with distance learning you can be there still while at home taking notes and keeping yourself rested. This could be integrated in many other ways as well, maybe the teacher is out one day or not everyone could go on the field trip. This technology opens a whole new door to the learning world and allows kids to expand and strengthen their education.

Kids who cant come to school should all be offered a chance, everyone should have an education and with this new technology you can. Third world countries where there's people who have never gotten education will now have that option available. Kids who cant control their lives in those particular places shouldn't be shut off from society. With this we will be able to teach and give knowledge to other people to hopefully make something more beneficial.

Distance learning benefits everyone because it makes education more accessible and helpful to all.

A9E4B29E6B0D,"Schools that offer distance lerning for students to get work done from home are far more helpful than schools that do not yet offer this as an option. When a student misses school they come back the next day with a pile of makeup work, that most of the time, will not get done. Not only that, but students end up getting behind in the material that they are learning, and teachers get overwhelmed trying to help them get caught back up. With the option of distance learning, students and teachers could work together and both benefit greatly by being able to work from home using resources such as video confrences and/or online classes.

When a student becomes ill or has to miss school because of other reasons such as doctors appointments, they will have missed everything that their peers learned that day in class, causing them to get behind in their studies. With online classes and video confrences with their teachers not only will they stay up to date with the material that the class is learning but they would get one-on-one time with the teacher. With distance learning students and teachers would not have to stress out about makeup work and re-learning the material.

Not only would this greatly benefit the student, but the teacher as well. If a teacher was able to have a video conference with an absent student, the teacher would not have to worry about that student getting behind. It would make the job of the teacher significantly easier. With online classes and video calls the teacher could therefore cutback on getting together all the grueling makeup work and not have to worry about their student getting behind. Instead all they would have to do is find a time that works during the day to have a video conference and explain the material face-to-face with their student.

All in all, having distance learning as an option in school would be extremely beneficial to both the students and the teachers. The students can stay up to date with the material in class and dont have to worry about a large pile of mkeup work waiting for them the next day, while the teachers do not have to stress about their students being behind. Online classes and teacher video conferences are an exceptional way to help everyone recieve an education.       ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

For example, some students that coming form another country they don't have time for go to school to learn English or for go like normal student to the school. I agree that some schools have this good program for students.

My firts reason, I agree with this program because, some students they can lear thing standing in home. For example they learn English, spanish, and franch or another thinf like "" How I can complete an application for work.""

And all this the students can learn standing in home.

My second reason, I agree with this program because, the stundent that will get this program they can dicided the time for take this classes online. Also the students can decided the day that they want to take this classes. Another, is that no only students can take this program also this program help people that never go to the school before and now with this program this people have the opportunity to learn something.

Some people are disagree with me. Becuase they think that if the student don't go to the school. they don't go to find another opportunity to lear. Another, is that they think is that teh internet is not a good place for learn thing.

C5C8126C1E65,"Alone, laying in bed, a bright lap top screen in front of your face, could this idea of distance learning replace a school day? Students would not benefit from distance learning because at home students have more distractions than a school environment and could easily lose focus. To continue, when learning at school, students learn and grow through social interaction with their peers. Having an isolated learning experience at home allows students to miss out out on social cues and friendships.

Distractions are something every human sees in their day to day life. At home students have a wide range of distractions from their cell phone to a basketball. This causes them to always have something else they could be doing rather then sitting down and taking an online class. Additionally, with all these distractions students have to have accountability and a sense of urgency to do their school work. If students are constantly pushing off their school work due to distractions then their education will be at risk.

Going to school helps students learn how to deal with their peers and adults socially. When going to school with their peers students learn problem solving and team building skills as a group. This prepares them for their future jobs and life in the work force by allowing them to understand how to work together. If a student is alone, in bed, and learning through a video it eliminates team building skills they could be learning in a regular classroom.

Some may believe students are better off with distance learning because it eliminates social anxieties and discomfort in the classroom. This is incorrect because in life humans have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable, the only things humans can count on in life is change and discomfort. To continue, students need to be prepared for all types of people and personalities because after school ends and the tests are all over, those people don't go away. If students are not participating in school with their peers because they are more comfortable at home it is teaching them to take the easy way out.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from the ability to attend these classes because it would allow them to put their education at risk and miss out on developing social cues. If all students were to take advantage of the distance leaning option, then it could cause this generation to fall behind academically and socially. If students are allowed to take the easy way out with school, what else will they later take for granted? ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B15874A0E53D,"I think it is such a great idea , That school diced to offer distance as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing . for example; if any of the students sick or have issues to come to school online classes will be the best way to catch up on school. which is going to make life is more easy for the people who dose not go to school, or have a problem to go to school. I'm sure would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. last year I took Arabic online because for a fact my school don't offer that ,so I diced to take it online . It was so helpfully for me I learned so much. Thats why I think all schools should offer online classes .Even the research shows online classes helped 89% student to catch up on schools .

B4994C771190,"Do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

I don't think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. First, the students not have somebody like a teacher to tell what to do and no body give pressuare. For example: if the student don't want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. Second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. For example: Everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. Third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home. For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. Next, if the student stay at home the student can do whatever the student want to do. For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day. Finally, if you take the classes at home and never came to school you cannot live the experinces that we live at school. For example: if you take a classes at home you cannot participate in any activity that the school have like a any sport or party or any activity that one is so funny and you can enjoy the activities with you friend or teachers who always are there for us to lisen if you have any problem and the techer are like a secret box because you can tell whatever you want and they never tell to someone. That's why I think is nice to get classes at school and I think is not so good to take classes at home because you can get more fun at school and is a experince that you will never forget.

In another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or your's parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody can't tell you anything.      ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

Who doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.

Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.

Secondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.

Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You can't always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people aren't perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.

In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.    ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FF056F9CD1D3,"In today's society, we rely on technology tremendously. Going from paper notes and assignments to having everything saved online and portable, many opportunities have been created to make life easier and more comfortable. Life may be more comfortable, but there are many drawbacks to relying solely on technology. While learning from home may sound pleasant, the drawbacks of online learning far outweigh the benefits. Not having a teacher present, having nobody to enforce rules, and having no opportunities to socialize with peers are just some of the reasons why learning from home is not as efficient as learning in school.

Having teachers to talk to face to face provides a greater advantage to students by enabling them to have one on one sessions regarding material learned in class. Having a teacher to talk to in class about an assignment or simply reviewing new material that was learned is not something easily replicated in online learning. Going over missed questions on tests or quizzes, and receiving feedback helps the student to learn from their mistakes. Being face to face with a teacher provides personalized feedback, where the teacher can easily tell a student areas that need improvement, or areas that can be reinforced.

Having the opportunity to learn from home is great, but being too comfortable may lead the student to procrastinate. There is no reason to wake up early to get ready for school; students essentially run on their own schedules, and do not have to worry about being late to school. While running on their own schedules may seem great, it would not be hard to take advantage of the fact that they operate on their own time. Not having a set schedule enforced leads the student to believe they can complete assignments given to them whenever. Not getting in trouble by an authority figure contributes to the mentality of doing work whenever, and not being concerned about repercussions.

An advantage to going to school are the peers, and learning to socialize. Socializing is a skill that is essential to the workforce or any career the student chooses to pursue. Collaborating with others shows the student complex ways to think of a solution, and meeting people with different backgrounds exposes the student to cultures they can learn about. Maintaining healthy relationships is a skill that is important to learn about as the student goes on in life, and learning to deal with different situations gives the individual future experience. Being able to function with a team, and efficiently communicate ideas to each other will provide numerous advantages in the workforce and in life.

The experience gained from being in school teaches students important life lessons, such as socializing, communicating efficiently, and time management. These are all qualities that many employers look for in individuals, and not having these skills may put one at a disadvantage. High school is the time when students learn to make new friends, find out who they are as individuals, and branch off to explore new hobbies. While learning from home sounds wonderful, the experiences made from being at school are ones that you can not replicate at home.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Majority of students' are listener and visual learners because they learn more when you see it in person and on paper. They wouldn't be learning as much as they could since they could be skipping the videos and be doing the assignments that the teacher assign them. Everyone learns differently from each other.

Some students' don't learn anything from their house because they won't focus. They could be getting distracted by other things like watching TV, listening to music and listening to their mom. Also they could be the type of student that gets distracted by every little thing. Majority of students are listener and visual learners because they learn more like that. Students' learn more by listening to a teacher because it will help you focus more on the topic the teacher is talking about. When you are just watching a video from your own house it's different because you might get lost and might not know what the video is trying to explain. Some students' are visual learners that like to write every single thing down or just like to see it in paper not just on a computer that you cannot write on it or anything like that. They wouldn't be learning as much as they could since they could be skipping the videos and be doing the assignment that the teacher assign them. They could just go straight to the assignment and not watch any video they had to be watched. They could be doing their assignment and act like they watch the videos they had to watched. Students' just want to rush with their assignment so they don't have to worry about it no more.

Some people say it depends on the type of person who you are. It also depends on how you wanna learn things. For example some students' want to learn on their own others would like a teacher to talk to them and explain things better. Some students' are different from each other they learn different ways. Not every one is the same from each other. They're many ways that students' can learn things. They could learn by their parents explaining things, a paper that a teacher wrote with explanation on it and even by a teacher explaining things. Everyone is not the same they learn differently from others.

Students' that work on their assignment at home aren't really getting any benefit. They wouldn't be getting any help from their teacher. Also if no one was at home with the student their wouldn't be any help from anyone. They could learn by their self but it could be hard if they didn't understand what the video is trying to explain.

6321CFDD093A,"Taking an online course can benefit a high school student in many various ways: they get to work in their own environment, it is a 1-on-1 process, they do not feel the pressure to catch up with other students as they would in a regular classroom, and it helps students work on a self-managed schedule. Although physically going to school helps with hands-on experience and social environments, could online classes or video conferences benefit a student as well?

Permitting a student to take courses online can have many takeaways. It can limit their social skills, working habits, and it lacks the assistance of a teacher in their presence. Some teens are not responsible enough to manage their time wisely for online classes and can disregard the importance of maintaining a set schedule for their classes. As well, some teens dont realize how hard it can be taking courses at home; you may not have to deal with the loud, obnoxious environment or constantly having to catch up with other classmates and teacher but it is obligatory that you turn in work on time and comprehend it takes more responsibility to ""teach yourself"" a course rather than having someone teach you the material and answer your questions in person.

Some people address that attending school physically has many more benefits, online can have just as many perks. All schools should offer distance learning because students who struggle in the classroom have potential to do better online. It builds a students confidence knowing that they can understand the material they are doing online, at the pace they need. As well, students can become more comfortable with their work area because they get to choose where they want to work. Giving them the ability to explore while doing work is dire for a teen. Keeping students in one area per class for an entire year does not engage students or excite them for what they might learn.

To add on, attendance is a great matter in school. If a student is home sick and has missed class, they would have to go online and get all the missing work they need to catch up on. Falling behind because of absent days is stressful for the student and the teacher because they must both make sure that the student is on track with classwork, homework, and tests... but if that student was home sick and did online school, they wouldn't have to stress at all because they can still continue to do their mandatory work for the day. Convenient, right?

Online school has more benefits than people believe and is a great alternative for students who would like to do better in class while out of the classroom. Each individual student learns in a different way at their own pace and online school can give them the opportunity to figure out how to enhance their work ethics and become more responsible. Nonetheless, online school is just as beneficial as physically attending school and could open new doors for students when it comes to better working habits and becoming more confident in your classes.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
B860C32986F9,"First, i think it's a good idea because, it's more comfortable for us (students) and we have our personal teacher; the students can learn more easily, in my opinion i prefer more take classes in my house with my personal teacher, although the technology every day make our life more easily, but not every-body prefer this idea, some students like assist to the school because their have your friends there, others don't like the idea to learn in their houses, one reason that i prefer learn in my house is i dont need wake up at 5AM, i have enough friends and i don't need to walk or take the bus to going to the school, but not every-body are equal.

Causes of consequence of these are:

* You probably are aisle.

* You don't like the school.

* Your parents thinks about the conferring or video classes.

*You feel more comfortable your house.

* You don't like how the teachers explain.

All of this causes of consequence show us the reality about why students prefer more video conferring than school, with your personal teacher you can ask over, and over again no matter what; he/she know that you are the only student so, in the school you can ask about over ad over again but it's not the same, there are more students and you teacher just have approximately 1 hour with 30 minute just for one subject, i think it's not enough time to learn. In the school there are many distractions like friends, boyfriend/girlfriend and others smallest details.

Why I'm going to the school? I'm going to the school for those reasons:

*Baseball programs

*I don't know how the online or conferencing working.

* My parents do not have enough money to pay it.

*I can't speak the language.

*In the school i have all my friends.

to sum up, the school bring to us every things that we need, like pen, scissors, piece of paper and others things. So if you prefer the school more than video-conferring you need take the bus, wake up at 5AM or 6AM, take a shower in the morning, the most probably you are tired at the end of the day. My brother did the college in a web site, i always ask, questions like that: How do you feel taking class in your house? are you always understand? Is it easy or hard? the last time that i saw him he told me yes i like the program, it's not difficult, i have more time to work, in my opinion is easy, but not every-body think equal that others.

In Conclusion, the school teach you about the values, things that you really need in the future, the video conferencing program just teach you the assigments and you need to pay it, the school are free and you can participate in sport programs like baseball, football, tennis whatever you want, the confering programs you can understand more easily and ask what-ever you want the thing is learn, in the school you can makes friends and share culture, Example: i am dominicane, i share my culture with my salvadorians friends. the conferencing programs doesn't have time to take it, in the school you need to stay there at 6:40 AM, the school bring you all of you need. finally i think is most better assits to the school.                                                                                                             ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
0B25AA5D6644,"Imagine being in a classroom full of loud students. You wouldnt get much done. With that being said dont you think that giving students the opportunity to take their classes at home? Although some students need ""hands on learning it should still be an opportunity. It sounds like a fantastic idea to me because some students work better alone and around no one, and it could also help students stay caught up and work at their own pace, and it would show how advance some of the students really are.

To begin with, some students work better by alone and around no one. Some times being in a classroom can be difficult for students. Most of the time its really loud and no one is really paying attention which can be hard for the students really trying to just get their work done and pass the class. Not saying that it has to be completely silent in a classroom for everyone to focus, but imagine being in a class where the students talk the entire period or continue to get in trouble, it would be hard to stay focused and get everything done right? When students get around other students they tend to do things to empress one another which can make it very hard for other students to get their stuff done. Meanwhile students could be at home doing their work. Just picture how much you could get done in a shorter time span at home by your self! A lot right? The only way you could get distracted at home while your doing your work would be if you distract yourself.

In addition, it could help students work at their own pace. Have you ever been in class and the teacher starts going to fast and your too busy trying to catch up that you end up not knowing what your doing? So wouldnt it be just wonderful if you could stay at home and do your classes online and just have video conferences. You could work at your own pace and go as fast or as slow ass yo please. Even if you felt like you need help or if you even had a question you cold still get in touch with a teacher that would be very willing to help you with whatever you need help with. For example at my school we have an online class called Plato which is something the school uses to help students make up any classes they need to make up at their own pace. Its not as bad as it seems, the whole course is do at the end of the year which gives you year to work on it whenever you feel like it. Students would get so much more done if they could work at their own pace. In a classroom full of students everyone works different some people work faster than others. Every students is capable of doing it but some just dont work as fats others, so giving them the opportunity to their work at home, and at their own pace is a marvelous idea!

Last but not least, it would show how advance some students really are. Being in a classroom can be very difficult especially when it comes to seeing how much your students really know. For example my freshman year in high school i had this friend named Generic_Name, everyone in that class though he was so smart he did all of his work and even turned in om time. Near the end of the year when we were testing everyone had submitted their test except Generic_Name, and when he did he had got the lowest grade in the class, when the teacher asked him hat happened he couldnt give her a reasonable answer, later we fond out the he had been cheating his way through her class and he couldnt cheat on the end of the year test. Now for his sophomore year he takes an online course for that class and hes actually doing much better and his grades are great. Now that he gets to work at his own pace and gets to do his work as he pleases hes doing way better! When you let students get the hang of what their doing and work how they want they tend to d better and make more progress. Scientist read that 89.7% of students that take their classes online tend to be more advanced.

Now that you know how beneficial giving students the opportunity to take classes online is you can agree with me because, some students work better alone, and around no one, and it could help students work at their own pace, and it would show how advanced that student is. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
29B80B7D1092,"Imagine learning from the comforts of your own home. Well, some schools actually offer online classes which is a great idea. The benefits of being able to attend classes from home is that there would be less bullying, more engaged students, and less stress.

Online classes would result in less bullying because you would not have as much time to congregate. Usually, at school children are bullied for the type of shoes they have on their feet. All you would see is their shirt through a laptop screen. Many of the side conversations would be limited because you would have to focus in order not to miss any information.

Also, their would be no physical contact, so the people who enjoy pushing and shoving others would have to keep their hands to themselves. Being at home would probably feel more like a no bully zone.

There would be more engaged students because many people in society love technology. Technology causes you to have more interactive assignments because you could do many things. For example, assign games, virtual labs, make 3d objects, and more. Everyday kids complain about having to do work on paper because it gets lost quicker or its destroying the trees. They feel as though technology is more efficient because you have a less chance to lose something that you spend most of your time on. People would be more organized and be able to keep a track of due dates.

A lot of people become stressed just entering the school building. Multiple students have social anxiety and fear walking pass a whole bunch of students at school. Also, having to speak in front of the class and having all eyes gazing at you. Another thing is having to adjust to a schedule and switch classes. For instance, trying to get around between classes in a crowded hallway is difficult and having to do it in a timely manner. Online classes decrease some of these challenges.

Being able to attend online classes is highly beneficial because their would be limited amount of bullying, more enthusiastic students, and a decrease amount of stress. Some may say online classes is not such a good idea because some people do not have internet or any technology. Most likely schools give you the materials needed to take online classes. People enjoy being comfortable so online school would put smiles on students faces.                                                                                                                                         ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
78611275D9A2,"Imagine being able to learn and attend school from the comfort of your own home. With the advent of distance learning, that just might become a reality. Distance learning would allow students to attend classes and participate in learning from home by way of online interaction or video conferencing. Allowing students to learn from home could have significant benefits, completely changing the traditional school system and altering the way we view school; however, it could also have some drawbacks, such as preventing teachers from monitoring students. Despite its potential drawbacks, distance learning would significantly benefit students, as it would resolve issues with the school transportation system and make it easier to attend school, cut down on the amount of time wasted in a traditional school environment, and prevent the spread of disease among school populations.

Today, transportation to and from school is slow, inconvenient, and wastes a large amount of time, requiring students to wake up earlier, walk to take a bus, and ride a slow, unsafe school bus to their school. In some cases, children cannot even get reliable transportation from buses and often get to school late due to issues with buses. At other times, students may not even be able to take a bus, and must get to school some other way, often taking time out of their parents' day as well as theirs. With distance learning, the issues of school transportation would be no more, as children would not have to worry about catching the bus or getting to school and could learn from home. This would allow students to get more sleep and to more reliably get to school, as they would no longer have to wake up early to catch the bus and would no longer have to worry about transportation issues making them late for school; they would simply have to wake up and walk to a computer in their house to access their school. Distance learning would undoubtedly mitigate the issues so often seen in the public school transportation system.

In today's school environment, a significant amount of time is wasted, with students taking time to walk from class to class, teachers showing up late, and large amounts of time wasted in class doing nothing. With distance learning, the school day could be compressed and shortened by removing things that waste time, such as traveling between classes and unused class time. Students doing schoolwork at home would be able to simply switch from one class to another after they have finished, and doing work online would shorten the amount of time it takes for teachers to teach and give work. Distance learning would also prevent students from being late to class, as the change between classes would become instantaneous if done online. If schools began using distance learning, it is very likely that the school day could be significantly shortened, giving students more time to do other things.

Recent events have shown how poorly the school system has performed in preventing the spread of disease among student populations. With the recent coronavirus outbreak, many school systems have shut down and moved to online learning to prevent the transmission of the disease between students. Currently, schools are a hotbed for the spread of disease, as sick students can infect many of their classmates due to the close proximity of students in schools. When sick students stay home, they prevent the spread of disease, but they are also forced to miss school and must make up work when they get back, leading to large workloads and lots of work. With distance learning, however, the spread of disease between students would be completely prevented, as there would no longer be any close contact between people. Many schools that have moved their classes online due to the COVID-19 outbreak have been very successful in both preventing the spread of disease and in continuing the education of students away from the physical school environment. Distance learning would completely prevent the spread of disease among students and faculty, and moving school over to distance learning now could make it easier to continue schooling if another disease outbreak occurs in the future.

Distance learning is a new form of education that could revolutionize the school system and change the way we perceive education. Allowing students to learn and do work at home would make education much easier for many in the country, and would remove many of the issues prevalent in the modern school system. While it may come with some drawbacks, distance learning will provide massive benefits to students in the long run, such as removing issues with transportation, decreasing the amount of time wasted, and preventing the spread of disease. The American public school system has long been criticized for being inefficient and out-of-date; distance learning may be just the thing to change that.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
C08F1994B248,"Offering distance learning can be extremely beneficial, depending on the child. Some children often feel safer at home than they do in school. Often times this can be due to bullying, mental disorders, or the desire to be at home with people they can trust. Children might also benefit from having one on one conversations with their teachers. In a public school, children might be nervous or scared to ask questions, give answers, or put themselves out there when they need help. An environment that makes sure a student is comfortable, will ensure that all questions are being answered. Finally, the education provided to a student at home is no different from the material public school students are learning in a classroom. Personally, distance learning seems like the perfect choice for students who have a hard time learning in a public school environment. These children have the opportunity to obtain a personal connection with a teacher, they are still getting a good education, and are more comfortable at home than in school.

When a child does not feel safe at a public school, this can distract their ability to learn and think. Many adolescents are bullied, which can cause a variety of mental disorders. Bullying disturbs a childs thought process and mental health. Mental disorders are becoming a larger problem than ever. Children can be diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and anger issues. These problems can all stem from being in a public school. When a child is at home, they do not need to worry about the bullying as much and can focus on their school work. Being around people that make you anxious will hinder your ability to retain knowledge. All a child will think about are these people who are making them feel sad, anxious, or angry. If a student decides to learn from home, they have the chance to ignore the people or things that make them feel bad and focus on their education.

Children who are in an environment that make them feel safe can often go out of their comfort zone. Often times, students do not ask essential questions becuase they are scared of scrutiny from their fellow class mates. This can leave a gap in a students knowledge of the topic. For example, if a student is learning a subject that is tough and their questions are not being asked, true comprehension is not being obtained. Being in a one on one setting can give a child a better chance at asking essential questions. Another upside to learning from a private teacher is the personal relationship that is gained. When a teacher better understands you, they have the chance to teach the way that a child needs. In a large class room, the teacher does not get the chance to teach every student individually. All children learn differently, and some can not learn any other way. When a teacher better understands the student, they can teach the way that the student will benfit from the most. The teacher can also get to know a student on a deeper level. Having a connection with a teacher is extremely difficult in a large classroom. When a student and teacher can connect, the chances of the student being more enthusiastic about learning is higher. The students drive to exceed expectations is also higher. Being in a one on one setting gives the teacher a better chance to understand the student and what the student needs. This also gives the student the chance to better understand the expectations of them.

The children who are taught from home are also recieving the same education, if not better. The cirriculum and subject matter is the same as what they would be learning in a public school. These children also get the opportunity to take the subject at their own pace. If they need more time digging a subject into their brains, they can get extra time. This might not be the same for public school students, because all students move on together regardless of anyone getting left behind. In public school, if a child does not understand the material, there is not much time for a teacher to review a topic before they have to move on. When it is just the student and teacher, the student can ask as many questions as needed and the teacher can answer the questions that that student has. Some children are slower learners and others are fast learners. It is hard to have to follow someone elses learning style and still have to understand the material being given to you. Often times public schools have programs for the slow learners and the students who need extra help with test taking, but it is not enough. These programs at public schools can help students with test taking, but they do not ensure that the child is learning everything they need in the classroom.

The distance learning program seems like it has many positive outcomes. In contrast, I do not believe this program is for everyone. Many students benefit from being in a larger, more social environment. For the students who can not handle public schools, this program is the perfect choice. It provides each child with the chance for an equal education, while getting the extra help they might need. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6D7CB0579AEE,"Imagine if you could do all of your school work on your own at your own pace? You would do everything from home. Although some people say that they won't focus on their school work at home they , actually they would learn better because they would not have teachers bothering them about assignments they need to turn in. This could be very beneficial for many students who could use the extra time.

For my counter argument I'm saying that they should not allow students to do online school. Doing school at home could be difficult for some students. They would have no one to help them so if they ever have question they would have to figure it out themselves. Sometimes you just need to ask a simple quick easy question but you wouldn't be able to if you are at home. Also being at home their is so many distractions you would easily lose focus on what you are doing. Another reason is that since you won't have a teacher reminding to complete your assignments you may forget about them. Being at school and having a teacher could help them do better in school.

There are many benefits of doing school at home. One of the benefits is that they learn at their own pace they can spend as much as they would like on a subject. There are times when I'm in class and I understand what we are learning and I finish all my work, but I then have to sit there and wait for the other students to finish or to understand it. During that time that I wasted doing nothing I could have done my other school work. Doing your classes online is a good way to keeping up with your class because you work at your own pace, this would help you maintain the best grades possible.

Another reason is that they have more time to complete their assignments. It's good because they don't have to worry about that the ""bell is going to ring"" and they are going to be late to class. They can just focus on there work without having to worry about a certain time they need to finish. Which means they can take as much time as they want, it would probably help them learn better. It's important that they do all their assignments and finish them, but it's also important that they understand the work.

In conclusion this could be very beneficial for many students. This could help them to have a better future and enjoy school more. This is best for people who struggle keeping up there class who are either behind or ahead. Some students drop out because they hating sitting in a class room all day. This is a good way to encourage students to stay in school and get an education.                                                                                                                              ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Like if i were on the position of taking online classes, because im working and i don't have that much time i would loved to study when ever i could.

For Example:

some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Contries.

For Example:

Some of the people don't have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes.

For Example:

There are some kids that don't go to school, having the school next to them, but there's alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they can't because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs.

For Example: My mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she can't because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at 11:30 pm so she doesn't have time but she would love if she could do it.

For Example: My dad he's going all the way to DC for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in countruction but weekends she goes to DC the classes start like at 10 and they end like at 1, if you like someting work hard for what you like.

For Example: I have a friend that he takes online he work's everyday, he takes his computer to his work so when he's on break runs to the computer and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",1,Distance learning,Independent,0.0
3716F4794AB4,"Online or video conferencing is seen by schools as an option for students to attend classes from home. I Think students would not benefit from attending class at home than they would attending classes at schools. Students would lose the opportunity to communicate with the teachers and other students about the topics they are learning about. Online classes don't keep up with what the student has learned and what the student needs help with. Online Classes are not a good option for students because they would not be able to communicate and ask questions, Students wouldn't take it as serious and cheat, and students would lose the option of extracurricular activities and to socialize with other students.

Online classes are not a good option for students because they cannot communicate and ask questions that could benefit their learning. For example if the classes were not prerecorded or all written down and you had to listen to a teacher talk online, if you miss any information you wouldn't be able to communicate directly to the teacher for some time and wouldn't be able to ask questions until after the lesson. If the class was thought through notes online then students would't be able to communicate with the teacher directly and would have to email them which would take time for them to respond. Students need to think about the information they are learning and not asking questions and making connections, could hurt students when they are taking a test.

Students would not take online school as serious as being in a classroom and learning and would probably end up cheating because they are in their own home. Online classes wouldn't be able to supervise or restrict students from cheating on an assignment or a test depending on what website or program the students are using to take the class. Students can access any program when they use their own computers unless they are provided b'y the online school. Students could become lazy and skip the lessons because students would feel they have the option because they are in their own home.

Online distance learning also takes away the option for students to socialize with other students and to attend or take extracurricular activities after school that they would normally take if they were at school. Students would not be able to work on any assignments or share any information with other students and would have to work alone. Students would not be able to join school sports, to be part of a team or to just be a little active instead of staying in your house all day, or attend other after school activities that would allow students to socialize and learn about more information that other schools provide after school. Students would lose the opportunity to stay after school with the teacher and ask questions and ask for help.

Online distance learning would not benefit students because it takes away the option of direct communication which is key when it comes to learning new curricular. The chance of cheating and laziness increase with taking online classes because its based on your schedule and you learn from your own computer. Also it takes away from socializing with other students and making new friends to spend time with and also losing the option to try after school activities. Also students could have many issues accessing the lessons which would ultimately disrupt their learning. Some schools may offer the option to attend classes while at home but students wouldn't benefit as much as attending classes at school.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
521D89F262DF,"Some people may say that offering the opportunity of being academically instructed from home is unbeneficial, while others may disagree and state that it's advantageous to the student or learner. With the increasing interconnection between persons and the modernization of society, time has become valuable. Days are often filled with many tasks and responsibilities to accomplish, leaving little to no downtime for a great amount of people. Another key point is traversing from location to location, which can also diminish one's freetime greatly depending on the distance. That's why some academic instituitons, for example, have switched to the virtual environment of the internet. ""Online-classes"" are offered to students who are not able, or choose not to attend physical lessons. Being able to read, listen, and do work from one's home lowers the amount of priorities and allows for greater flexibility in schedules. However, the cons outweigh the pros, and being able to attend classes from home would not be beneficial to students because it encourages limited physical activity, hinders social development, and leads to unproductivity.

Physical exercise is one of the core practices to maintaining healthy bodily functions and reducing the risk of disease. Not being active and sitting down for long periods of time can be detrimental to one's health; negatively affecting posture, muscles, and more. With recent and current generations being in school now more than ever, the risk of not being physically active enough goes up significantly. Taking classes from home can multiply this danger even further as walking from class to class and carrying books is not required. If an individual taking online virtual courses does not invest freetime to get the needed active hours, they're putting themselves at a greater risk for developing harmful conditions (such as diabetes) than students on campus who stimulate their muscles travelling to different locations, keeping them in shape. Additionally, academic insitutions often offer sports/physical education classes that help an invidual improve or maintain their fitness. Limiting oneself to a home environment can prevent an individual from being physically active, and in turn lead to harmful effects on health.

Humans are a social species; they evolved to cooperate and communicate with each other to ensure survival. The same basic principles apply in today's world, in fact even more. Almost all jobs require individuals to work around other people. Communicating with one's boss effectively, or group members in a project a person is working on, requires valuable conversation skills. When a person takes online lessons rather than attending physical lessons, their social sphere gets constricted. The expansive horizon full of different backgrounds and cultures, typically available at academic institutes, is no longer available to an online learner. They're restrained soley to their home; making it nearly impossible to find friends with similar interests from classes. Like a muscle, empathy, conveying efficiently, and understanding are all strengthened through practice. Limiting social practice decreases these skills, which in turn affects a person's career and even their mental well-being.

A person's home is usually seen as a place of relaxation. Coming home from a long day at school to a comfy bed helps one take a break from all the stressors. The seperation between the busy school day and leasurely home is not so clear to an individual who attends classes from home. Instead of having delayed gratification like people who attend a physical academic instituion (study & work, then freetime at home), home-learners have access to instant gratification, which can be abused. These students have food, entertainment, & other distractions that are constantly present. At any time they can become sidetracked by these items, whether it's because they're bored or want to take a break. Once sidetracked, progress on assignments or other important tasks are halted, causing a drop in productivity. This can cause serious problems such as missing deadline dates and even neglecting to take care of one's personal health (brushing teeth, taking showers, et cetera). On the other hand, at school, the amount of distractions are limited. For example, there are often quiet libraries at academic instituions. This provides an environment where the student can focus and do work instead of losing their attention span and precious time.

While there many benefits to virtual classes if utilized properly, these type of courses often result in a greater amount of negative effects on the individual taking them because they promote poor time-management, limit social skills, and reduce physical fitness. Home locations are typically filled with entertainment systems such as consoles, TVs, and more, which can affect the concentration of the students taking online courses and cause them to take longer on assignments. Furthermore, when taking an online coure, interacting with new people is a difficult task; consequently, this can cause them to miss out on opportunities and isolate themselves from others. Finally, in home learning environments, physical exercise/activity is limited as it doesn't require the individual to move around a lot or utilize muscles. This can cause one's health to affected. Trying to be efficient as possible with one's time can be counterproductive, sometimes it's better to go with the flow and enjoy life as it is.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
DFE2FC3897AF,"Technology has been applied in many aspects in our lives that have improved major components such as economic machinery, medical equipment and cures, transportation, and even entertainment. However, when referring to education, there isn't a clear growth in the development of technology within the school environment. For generations, the school dynamic has remained relatively the same with very similar and unaffected teaching styles since the 20th century. This can be very ironic since there are many problems and flaws with our US educations system today. Conflicts relating to students struggles in productivity and uninterest in school has been the effect in mental health with an increase in depression, and many students who are diagnose with this draws back to their high levels of stress in schools. Many students lose their passion and motivation to be creative and optimistic through their future. Though, there are new ways and options into solving these problematic situations. One way is through online distance learning, an alternative for students to attend classes from home by using online resources or video conferencing. Online schooling can benefit and improve students learning by providing digital classes to supply students for the best education possible.

The efficiency and availability of the internet is so common among teenagers, which allows them to easily access online assignments and lessons. The great thing about online classes is that students are able to go in their own individual pace and complete tasks that are more suitable for them. It is crucial for schools to acknowledge the different learning styles of each student and is something that is rarely considered in traditional classrooms. With this method, it will help students be more efficient and productive through out their day to day lives with the privilege of learning and focusing on their personal struggles such as reviewing lessons or topics.

Not only is online schooling beneficial for students learning progress, but it also saves so much time throughout the day. As young successors, it can be very challenging to balance time since majority of their day consist of school.

With ruffly eight hours used in schools and additional hours used in after school circular activities and homework, it can be nearly impossible to insert time for rest and self reflection. It is a huge necessity for students to get the required 7-9 hours of sleep a day to allow the brain to rest and prepare for upcoming tasks, and it enables them to perform at their best. Online education allows students to have time to do other interests in their ideal lives which increases productivity all together. Not only is this great for them to expand their horizon in experiencing and developing their own qualities, but also is convenient for students with hard and difficult circumstances; whether its dealing with family, financial state, and other private matters.

The contrary of distance learning can be dismantled in many well opposing minds in school departments due to the explicit and dramatic change to the idea. There are some counter implications that can be mentioned for the sake of improvement. With at home lessons, students will lose interaction and connection in a classroom which might be a strong skill needed in future careers. Assignments involving group presentations, live debates, experiments, and other tasks will be modified through online learning; but again, these assignments are best performed in classroom settings because of its complexities. This conflict may affect students learning from the lack of preparation or knowledge for certain high level classes. Missing out on these type of teachings is something that students should consider, and choose what is best and prior for their career fields.

Whether a student prefers in-home classes or not, online learning is not the main issue of why this was brought to attention. The climax of this topic is the undeveloped schooling system that is placed today. It is severely flawed and is failing to reach the full potential for students to become successful; this is due to lack of time, loss of determination in school, limited learning methods, and more. Online education provides a solution that implements an update version of teaching to solve these struggles and benefit students learning in order for them to reach their future achievements in life.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7675891A9A05,"Students would not benefit from taking classes at home. One could have a lack of communication or social skills. The student can not have easy access to things like school students can. One could also lose or have less friends. There would be no benefit from taking online classes because the student would not have easy access to things, have less friends, and have a lack of communication.

A way online class is not beneficial, is that the student not good with communicating. From the student being kept away with human contact, it could unleash a shy side to a student. Being shy can also get in the way of getting a job. One may not know how other people are, how they communicate, and how they react. Overall, the student may not know how to act or respond to the situation.

Distance learning could cause the student to not have a easier access to things like kids in public school. Say if you need a book for a subject that you are in, most public schools would give it to you for free. However, if you are home online, you would most likely have to buy an expensive book. Although you could just buy your own materials, public schools usually provide supplies for free.

Lastly, not being in public school could possibly effect one from having less friends. A limited amount of friends can cause you to stay barricaded in your house most of the time. It could also trigger depression, making you feel alone or like you have nobody. One may fade away from their friends because they do not see them often. One of the reasons of being in school is to make friends, so learning online defeats the whole purpose.

Learning at home is not as dependable as in learning in school. Being home schooled can cause unnecessary payments for materials and supplies, while most schools hand out supplies to kids for free. Distance learning could be causing one to stay in its own bubble, or not know how to improve their social skills. Getting educated on a computer at home, can make you lose friends and spend less time with them. These are my reasons why being in school is better.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
6D152ABC0582,"Do you believe that online schooling would benefit students more than actually going to school? Online schooling would give students the ability to get more sleep, then they could start their work whenever they want to. It would also be more beneficial so that students could get one on one teaching and focus better. However, there is way more distracting things at home than at school, such as video games, phones, sleeping whenever, etc.

First, if students could get more sleep, they would have more energy to push through and work instead of being tired. They could have their own schedule that they could go on and get their work done. For example, if a student slept for 10 hours, when they wake up, they would have a lot more energy to get their school work done instead of being tired. It really just depends on how much sleep that you need to get through the day.

Second, one on one teaching would be much more easier for a kid to learn. Instead of one teacher teaching a class of 25 students by herself, she would be teaching one student and much more work would get done also. For example, if one student is the only being taught, there isn't 20 other students that she has to worry about. She can focus on that one kid and much more work would get done. It also depends on if the student is willing to put in effort to get their work done.

However, one of the downsides of online schooling is that there is more distractions at home than at school I believe. They also don't have anyone to really motivate them and to force them to get their work done. For example, they have video games, phones would be much more distracting, etc., and if they dont have anyone to tell them to get there work done, they would just decide not to do it. Teachers help push students to get their work done, but online schooling would change that and more kids would never pass more likely.

Online schooling would benefit students much more than actually going to school. Online schooling would let students get more sleep to be able to get work done, One on one teaching is much more beneficial; However, there is lots of distractions at home that would get students side tracked from getting their work completed. I would like to have online schooling and classes much more than going to school, thats just my opinion. It could be a very controversial topic in some ways, it really just depends on how you like to be taught and the best way for you to learn.                          ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Alarm goes off at 7. That feeling of ickinees for having to get up so early for school is just morbid. What if that didn't have to be the case? What if you could stay at home all day and still learn the same materials that are needed? There are schools that offer classes online so students can stay at home and still get the same education as those who are in class so early in the morning. The only question is, does one outweight the other in any way? I think it does. Learning at home will never be the same as actually going to school because of social, economical and educational reasons.

School can be a lot more than just educational reasons. This can be a place where you meet your friends that end up being your life long best friend or even someone who you eventually start a life with somewhere along the future. These best friends you make can even be your bridesmaid/groom at the wedding. Yes, it may be a bit of a stretch but it's very likely compared to just sitting at home in front of a laptop all day. Social interaction is something very important to every human being. Starting from an early age opens up a whole lot of oppertunities. For example, there are going to be jobs where all you do is interact with costomers and if you are not strong in that mindset, there is a good chance that things will only be going downhill from there. At home, there is almost no source of interaction with people unless it's people that you are already familliar with, whether it mom, dad, siblings, or even the dog. These people who suddenly go out into the world to look for jobs or even go to college is gonna have a hard time socializng with other people becuase they aren't used to it. Another big thing is that, at school there are plenty more oppertunities to join clubs and get into more volunteer activities that will help with college admssion or even day to day life.

The popular saying ""every penny counts"" is overused but more that half of those people that say it dont take it into action. When going shopping, and you see an item on sale that you saw at another store for a full price, there is a good chance that you will get the one on sale. This scenario is pretty simmilar. Most homeschooling and online courses come with some kind of a payment plan. Why pay when the government is giving out free education? It may not seem like much at the moment, but somewhere along the way, you are going to have to pay for college or a new house. That money spent on unnessecary online education coud've helped get you out of debt. Going to school may even up your chances of not even paying for college at all. This can be possible through scholarships. For example, almost all schools offer different types of sports. If I were to join basketball and end up playing very well throughot all of high school there is a good chance that i could get a full ride scholarship to a great school. Again, you can still join that same sport outside of school but there is a good chance that they will make you pay for it rather than it being completly free like playing for the school. There are so many benifits that schools offer that won't make your pockets hurt.

Learning at school in the front of the class sitting on a desk is never the same than learning on a couch. For example, if you are at home and don't understand a specific material, you can search it up but it wouldn't be as efficient as having the teacher who is teaching that exact material have them exlain it in way you are conmftrable with. A good relationship with the teacher goes a long way. Everyday, they have the chance to learn something about you and with that knowlage they are able to know what your strength and weaknesses are. With that, they can help you improve in areas that they see needs some assistance and it can influence you not only become a better person but also have an impact on academic achievments as well. If my teacher saw that I was struggling with time managment and they gave me tips and lessons on how I can improve my time managment skills, it would help me get things done on time and also limit the amout of stress I had, which can lead to great success.

There are a lot of people in school that wish that they could have that chance to stay home and learn there. I was actually one of those people too. I hated having to wake up at the break of dawn to drag myself over to a place where we sit in a chair and get lectured for 6 hours straight. The idea of staying in my comfy bed eating my apple slices seemed like heaven. That was until I realized what I would be missing out on. Meeting my friends, my awesome teachers, and joining cool and interesting clubs. The things like having to wake up early didnt really bother me because I tell myself that it's something that I will need to get used to in the future for college and jobs anyways. Of course, like anything else on the universe, there will be some bad days but it's important to remember that taking that step to walk out the door for school, is being a step ahead to success. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
239FAAA1C2FD,"Are you a teacher for a public school in need of a different way to teach students! Well read up because some public schools are offering distance as an option for students to attend class from their home from online. Big companies have done this for the last decade. It's a brilliant idea for public schools to attempt this idea and, I'll explain why, Firstly! it's a safer way of learning in modern America where pointless shootings in school happen. Secondly If a Student who's bedridden or medical handicapped have a chance for Public Education or dont fall behind of other students. Lastly this technology isnt the hardest thing on earth, Its as easy as pressing three buttons and having Wi-fi. Now for the deeper expiation.

Let's get the serious point out of the way firstly. Public and Private schools aren't the safe haven for students anymore. Not after the rise of school shootings in America, so the idea of a safer way for students to learn from home seems like a better option for the ones that get bullied for example. Your counterargument of having the student tell the teachers about it is invalid and only give room for more harassment of the student. So leaving the student on a screen thats being watched by the teacher and away from said students who pick on student is a way to reduce bulling and mass school shooting. Next point is a really important point as well.

Life happens let's be honest people are doomed to get sick or harmed in a way where they can't move much or at all. Such things prevent Students like myself from being caught up in classes during such important and demanding times like the next couple of months. Plus a nice little bonus is fellow students are there for the sick student which is always great to see. Now Its time for the last part.

Finally, This technology isn't hard to set up and maintain. Should be easy as three buttons and a front camera on both or single computer. there is way's to watch the student so they don't get distanced and or abuse the power: Like playing games, watching videos and, any social media, since learning time. Not game time.

The point I am trying to get to with these is well, technology is changing and schools arent changing as fast with the technology. So many problems with school can be counter-acted with this tech. like the problems of bullying that sadly leans to mass shooting. Extremely sick/handicapped students falling behind after life dealt them a bad hand.

I am a student and hopefully you reading this will be looking forward to this new way of learning.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7F47FC448059,"Imagine that you need to stay home due to a family emergency, but you have an important test to take at school. Some schools offer ways to learn online and be able to see your class lesson even if you are not there. Although it could encourage more people to skip school, it still is a good option if you cant get their. Distant learning is a good option because a family emergency could happen, could watch classes as a way to study, and you could be sick or have other health problems.

Out of school learning would be a good option for people that have family emergencies. In my freshmen year of high school, i had to stay home because my great grandmother had died and i had no way to know what i missed. If schools did out of school learning i could watch and save the class lesson for latter so i would be able to go to the funeral, and not have to worry about what i am missing. Lets say your mom or dad has a medical condition like Autism or Multiple sclerosis, and you need to stay home because they are having trouble with their daily routine. During this situation you could take care of that family member and still do school work due to the out of school learning. In cases like this, it would benefit the student and the teacher because the student is not needing to ask for the makeup work since he already saw the class lesson and did the work.

Out of school learning would be a good option for ways a student could study. Even though some kids do not like to study, this would allow students to watch their class over and over again to get a better understanding for the topic/ class. Some kids have a hard time learning at school because of all the commotion in a classroom, but the teacher could record himself talking about the subject and put it online for students to listen to. Lets say you needed to miss school because you are traveling with family and you had a test the day you are arriving back in town. While on the trip or in the car/ plane, Listing to your notes and past classes could prepare you for the upcoming test. Being able to study this way would increase students ability to do well and prepare for tests.

Out of school learning would help with people that are sick and that have bad anxiety. School can be very hard for kids if they have bad anxiety due to being in a stressful environment with other kids. This would allow students to live a life without fear of going to school because they can learn from class lessons. When i was in sixth grade i had an illness called C diff, this can be very dangerous for people exposed to this very deadly virus. After finally getting out of the hospital i had to start doing work even though i was still sick. One of my teachers had to come to my house to help me, and this could have been dangerous for her since i could still get people sick. In a case like this, out of school learning would be a great tool for students so they dont get other people sick or have major panic attacks.

Out of school learning and doing the video and audio learning could help so many students and would be better for the school system and for its students. It would help people with disabilities or other medical conditions, help with unavoidable emergencies, And would create new ways to study and learn new material. If this is something that you would like your school to have, contact the school board and they might just like your idea.                          ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
48B9DA15FD36,"Most students have some sort of difficulties when it comes to school, whether its learning, family problems, social life, or even health issues. Therefore, students may not make it to school or might not be motivated to go because they feel behind. A vital solution to this problem could be online classes and video conferencing to help the students who were not at school or any students who needs extra attention. Online classes and video conferencing could benefit many students by giving those young scholars the help and lessons they might have missed in class. I think schools should implement online classes and video conferencing because they may not fully comprehended the information, they may have an terrible learning environment, or they may just miss days for personal reasons.

Majority of students dont get things the first time round and thats understandable, but some students still dont get it after the second or third time. Those are the students that are most likely scared to ask questions or dont have the time to stay back with their teacher for extra help. This is where online classes could really help those who struggle in school. With online classes, students have a one on one sessions with their teachers ensuring any confusion they have with the lessons in class. For example, what if a student is in class and he or she doesn't get the content thats being taught, but he or she is afraid to ask questions or is too frustrated to ask anything. This is why the online classes is a great option for students like that. Some may argue that she could just stay after school or they may not even go online to get help, but I see it like this, if someone is truly struggling and desperately wants help then they will get all the help they need.

Being in a comfortable environment is a key to success. Even in school, without a suitable and comfortable environment, learning and focusing is going to be ten times harder. Students cannot learn in class when the teacher is constantly telling the kids to be quiet or sit down every five minutes. Even in a class with your friends could be a bad learning environment because they are constantly distracting you, but with a online class at home, you are in a very comfortable environment being that your in the comfort of your own home. This is great for kids that want to extend their studies to the college level but have a hard time getting the information because of their class room environment. Many colleges and jobs are education based, so in order to get into the best of the best of colleges or jobs, students have to have the best grades they could possibly get, but with class room disrupts students cant learn and show their learning to their best abilities.

Students are humans too and us as humans have problems too. Meaning that us students are going to miss days of school for many different reasons, whether it be family issues, health issues or even car issues, we as students are going to miss a day or two. With that day being missed, students are bound to miss a lesson and be behind on work which would eventually result in a zero in the grade book. With the access of online classes we could be brought up to date with the current lessons and understand whats going on in class. For example, if a student misses three days because of the flu, they are definitely going to be behind on work and behind in the class curriculum, but say if the student did have an online resource to help him catch up from home, that student wouldnt miss anything and be up to speed with the class even from home. By the time that student returns to school they would know everything that happened even in the days they were out.

In conclusion, students are humans too and we are not perfect machines that can learn everything on the spot or be at school everyday, so with schools offering an alternative to help students learn away from school is a genius idea that can benefit many students in the future.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
A38187259EEE,"For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you don't have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences.

Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ? "" or "" What if I can't do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn.

For me if I could choose , I'll choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me.

So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say

"" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it. Online classes are greate! but for dome people don't think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
03401B71D0F2,"When I was younger I always dreamed of being able to go to school at home. Now I could have the opportunity to do just that.

When having online classes at home it could benefit students in many different ways. It could be beneficial for kids who are sick and unable to make it to school and it could also save the school system money. If all schools offered this distance learning there is not any doubt many students would jump on the train to participant. Distance learning is very helpful in many ways so why not do it?

Firstly, if students were to be sick or unable to make it to school, they would not have to worry about missing any work because all of it would be online. When I have been sick in the past I always seem to return to school feeling overwhelmed in the amount of work I have to complete. If students had the opportunity to have all their work online and not stress about being out sick, they could finish their work and not worry about having to make it up. If all schools offered this imagine the amount of people wanting to try it. This would be a great opportunity for kids to not have to miss class.

Secondly, it could save the school system money. Schools have to pay out to teachers, cafeteria workers, cleaners, and utilities. If having the opportunity to throw away some of those expenses why not do it? Several schools have been shut down for the lack of money, I believe this could have helped them stay open. I think if schools went to working at home it could save them any trouble that occurs in the long run. Schools are not cheap and if they have the opportunity to cut cost it could benefit them in many ways.

Therefore, some say students would not work as hard at home rather than at schools. But it has been said kids are more motivated when in a comfortable and safe environment. When students are more motivated they are more likely to get more work done and finish assignments on time. This could help kids finish their course faster and move on to the next class. Also students would be not as stressed about school and be able to work at a steady pace. If distance learning was offered to students how could it not benefit them?

In conclusion, having the opportunity to work at home could be very beneficial for kids. It could benefit them when they are unable to make it to class. It could also benefit the school system with the unnecessary costs. If school systems offered this the more growth and motivation would improve in students. Moreover, I believe having distance learning would benefit school systems and students in many ways. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
449E99B2C0A0,"Many kids are home schooled. And there has been a lot of debate to whether or not it is better than public or private school. The debate spans from social skill problems, bullying, and learning opportunity. In my personal opinion home schooling is a more beneficial for students because they have a choice in what they can learn, they can learn more efficiently, and they will have more time for other activities.

First, being able to choose what to learn is very important. Public school has very limited options, especially if they are in AP or IB classes. In IB kids are limited to only three sciences: Biology, Chemistry and Physics. although they are important classes, they are very basic and dont allow for expanded knowledge of other sciences. But in home schooling they are able to pick and choose any science they wish. There are no restrictions as to what you want to learn. A good example is, if a kid wants to be a pilot, he or she would attend classes more geared towards aerodynamics and engineering. These options are not only limited to sciences though, another example is language. In public school there are usually two to three choices to choose from; Spanish, French and American sign language. It is very important to understand another language and having only three choices is extremely limiting. But that is not the case with home schooling. In homeschooling the student is open to every language there is. Having the option to learn every language is an amazing opportunity. Many jobs and careers open up the moment you learn another language. Not only does it open jobs but it also allows the student to have access to other cultures and speak with people from other countries, which further expands their thirst for knowledge.

Being home schooled also is a more efficient way of learning. A day in public school is seven hours long. That leaves about an hour and thirty minutes for every class. Being able to grasp a concept and have a concrete understanding of that concept is very difficult to do in an hour and a half. But with homeschooling the student has as much time they need to fully understand a concept. Not only do they have unlimited time but they also have the internet as an extremely efficient learning source. Additionally, in public school there is a lot of waiting. Whether it's for a teacher to move on or for a fellow classmate to catch up. It is very inefficient way of conducting a lesson. The teacher has to constantly be checking on students to be sure that they understand the subject. Not only that, but a single class can range from fifteen to thirty kids. This causes the learning environment to reach a plateau, where nothing new is being taught because a couple kids dont understand the material. None of that is a problem with homeschooling. The student can finish a lesson at their own pace and move on to learn other things. It's more efficient to be able to learn something in an hour and have a full understanding of it and move on without having to wait for other students. There is no waiting involved and is a constant flow of learning new knowledge.

Finally, being home schooled leaves more time for other activities/extracurriculars. In public school there is very little time after school to be able to have fun or do other activities. Generic_School for example starts at 8:20 AM and ends at 3:00 PM. this leaves students with three to four hours to do the things that they like, excluding homework and studying. When homework and studying are added in it equates out to about an hour or two to be able to do things. The students who get affected by this the most are student athletes. Most teams practice for about two hours, which leaves students to get home around five o'clock. But when the student gets home they have to do homework and study, and by the time they're done its already seven o'clock. None of this is an issue with homeschooling. The moment the student wakes up they can work on school work and get it all done before its even noon. Or they can spread it out evenly throughout the day. This causes the student to have more free time and pursue other things that interest them. For example, a student can wake up and work on school work while eating breakfast. They would work hard until they finished their work, which would take a lot less time than being in public school. When they are done they have the rest of the day to either play a sport, go to museums, or explore the arts. Additionally, having that much free time would encourage students to participate in more volunteer work. Since they wont have to be at a building for seven hours they can go outside whenever and will be more inclined to help the community. This will result in a healthier and more friendly living environment.

In conclusion, there is a lot of debate about whether or not kids should be home schooled or should attend public school. But there are far more benefits of students being home schooled. The benefits range from being able to have a choice in what to learn, being able to learn a subject more efficiently, and having more time to do extracurriculars/other activities.      ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5EFC63975196,"Schools have offered distance learning as an alternative to going to school. Schools offering distance learning do so by way of online or video conferencing, these options have been given possibly due to students lack of attendance at school or a personal matter which involves them not being able to go to school in person. Being able to have these variety of options is extremely beneficial to a student due to circumstances they may be dealt and the routes they can take to keep their education up to par with their fellow students.

Albeit many students are not able to go to school due to personal issues there are alternatives given by schools to keep track on the necessary education required. Back when schools wouldn't give other options for schooling many individuals would be held back, now the reason why this isn't the optimal outcome for students and schools alike is because if you fail a grade you don't graduate in time which schools dont want you to do as not graduating on time hurts their rates and they want you gone as soon as possible to keep their graduation rates intact, now the reason failing a grade for a student is bad is due to exactly that, they fail a grade resulting in complications that can hinder their future greatly. Failing a grade is bad enough but instances where this can be bothersome is when their trying to get into a good college or they want to land a good job, this is why schools have given students options if they can't show up to school because both parties get hurt if that individual doesn't pass their grade.

Being able to have the necessary resources to take classes without going to school is extremely beneficial to a student. Whether a student got into an accident or had a child for example would normally keep them out of school due to the severity of the circumstance and possibly hold them back due to the amount of absences they have acquired,as sad as that may seem schools have recognized that many students can't even go to school due to their personal situations so they have made multiple ways to keep students education up to date so they wont be held back. An added benefit is if an individual were to get into trouble a lot and get sent to the schools office multiple times they would send that student to a special school for delinquents but because the schools have had new ways to teach students some of the kids that are supposed to go to special schools just stay home and catch up with online schooling for instance. Now negatives of having these options are that individuals may start to abuse it, for instance if somebody is assigned to online schooling they dont have to go anywhere to do it they can stay home, but some individuals may use this as an excuse to stay home and relax all day instead of doing what they're supposed to do, due to this there should be a few rules that prevent that from being the case.

schools who have offered distance learning as an alternative to going to school have done well as there are many circumstances students may be going through and having the opportunity to be able to stay in pace with their education is great for them and schools alike. And being able to have the necessary resources to take classes without going to school is extremely beneficial to a student. And although there are a few flaws to this system schools have given they are to little to take away from the significance of this approach.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

A very important question is whether schools should embrace the possibility of becoming more online focused, or continue with traditional in person learning.

They allow for more flexibility for students with busy schedules, make it easier for sick students to stay involved, and ensure that students are familiar with technology.

Schools offering online classes would make sure that students who have jobs or other things that they need to do don't fall behind in school. Having online classes allow students to work on assignments wherever they have access to the internet. This could be during a lunch break at work, or late at night after a busy day. Traditional schools have the same hours as a standard job, and a student who needs to work should be able to go to their job and still attend school. Online classes could also allow for students to travel and not miss valuable lessons in school. Students have responsibilities outside of school, and timing shouldn't prevent them from getting an education.

Another benefit of online classes is that students don't miss lessons because they are sick. They can learn from their bed while dealing with a cold and not have to decide between taking care of themselves and staying on pace in class. In more extreme examples students dealing with more severe health issues won't fall behind nearly as much when they miss large chunks of school. In addition to this, students with mental health issues can decide to stay home and still do the schoolwork they are assigned. Stress, depression, and anxiety levels are at an all time high and giving students the ability to work in an environment they're comfortable with can help.

In addition to these last two reasons, online school familiarizes both students and teachers with technology. Technology is a constant of modern day life, and people need to know how to use it well. Having online classes helps students develop skills that weren't previously taught. For example, their typing ability would most likely be much better, and they would be comfortable using the internet for things like research or communication. An increasing amount of companies are using technology in the workplace, and schools need to prepare students for that. Online classes also help teachers develop skills that they didn't previously have, as the majority of them didn't grow up using the internet.

In a world more focused on technology than ever, schools need to adapt and offer online classes to their students. They allow for more flexibility for students with busy schedules, make it easier for sick students to stay involved, and ensure that students are familiar with technology. However, this does not mean that school should be strictly online. The option to attend class online benefits many students, but some prefer traditional schooling. Online school would also have to structure itself differently to prevent cheating. Smaller assignments could be done online, but tests may have to be taken in classrooms to stop students from cheating. While online classes may not be for everyone, the option should be presented as the benefits are too great to ignore.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
63F533DA2C4E,"A on going debate of today is whether schools offering students the option of distance learning. With distance learning students get the opportunity to attend classes from their home. Some people believe that allowing students to do their work online and through video conferencing would help them. Others believe that distance learning would cause problems with the students such as poor communication skills and not being able to handle real world situations. Schools should not be offering distance learning as it could cause more problems for the students.

One reason schools should not be offering distant learning is that it could cause students to have poor communication skills. Not attending a school could cause students to not know how to properly talk with other. For example students that spend most of their time at home due to online schooling would not be able to learn how to act with others their own age or with authority figures. Attending schools would also allow students to be around children their own age and allow them to make friends. Distance learning would also cause problems by not allowing students to interact with others outside of the people they already know making it difficult for them to meet new people.

Students should also attend schools so that they can learn how to handle real world situations. Attending schools would allow students to learn and see how things will be when they become adults. One example of this is that a student that uses distance learning would not know how to work well with others and could cause problems for them at their job. Attending schools could help students with job interviews and make them more prepared instead of having no experience with others they do not know well. Students that do not attend schools could also become lazy and introverts due to not leaving the house as a majority of children and teens time is spent in school.

Some claim that distance learning helps those with mental illness and that attending schools would cause more harm to these students than help them. While those who support distance learning want to help students they could be causing more harm to these students mentally. Allowing distance learning would cause students to not be able to make friends or to interact with others their own age. Distance learning could also cause them to have more trouble then they originally had by not being able to interact with multiple other people.

Distance learning is a topic of debate today because it could have such an effect on how the new generations turn out and how they develop. Others should not allow distance schooling as it can cause many negative effects with children and teens. Distance learning could stunt the mental growth of many students as well as cause them to not be fully prepared with real word situations. Do not allow the new generation to be held back by something like distance learning tat could have been prevented.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

High school students have it the worst because they have to get up at 6 in the morning just to get to school on time. Who wants to get up that early? If a student has work or any after school activity, they wont be able to get school work done because the're too tired at the end of the day or just dont have the time. Students that are home schooled or take an online class are able to make time for school work and it's not as much of a hassle. Bullying is a big issue going around in schools and most students that are getting bullied dont wont to go to school because they are scared. Having the option of letting them take it online would help them not be as stressed about school and be more thrilled to go. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they wouldn't have to wake up early, it's an alternative if they dont feel safe at school, and students would feel less stressed.

Students, especially teens, hate waking up early in the morning to go to school. Studies show that students should be getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Most high school students, however, get 4-5 hours of sleep each night because of homework and after school activities that keep them up all night. Students drink coffee or energy drinks to keep themselves awake even though its not good for them and if they drink too much it could hurt them. Students can only have a certain amount of absences and tardy s before they have to go to summer school which no kid wants to do. Having classes online would help students get the recommended amount of sleep each night.

Bullying is a big problem in most public schools today. Students that are getting bullied dont want to go to school because they are scared of what the bully is gonna do to them. Even if they go and tell a trusted adult there is no telling what the teachers gonna do or if the bully is gonna stop. Most of the time when someone is getting bullied all the school dose is suspend the bully for a couple months and thats it. Some extreme cases of bullying have led to the student harming themselves or trying to take there own life. Having online classes at home would help the students that are getting bulled feel less scared and learn better.

Having school at home or online wold help the students not feel as stressed. Going to school each day tired is already hard enough on students, but now they are getting even more stressed out because of homework for different classes. If students wanted to take AP or IB classes they couldnt do anything else because those classes are very time consuming. Students couldnt have a job or have anything after school if they take an AP or IB because of the amount of stress they would be going through. Having online school would help fix that issue and allow students with the opportunity to take those hard classes.

Going to school helps students make friends. School is the number 1 place where most children and teens make friends and meet people and if they taking the classes online, they dont get the chance to experience that. If a kid doesnt have very much social interaction then they become very anti social and not have a whole lot of people skills. Staying at home and taking classes online has its benefits but actually putting in the effort to wake up and come to school everyday and meeting new friends is worth coming to school for. If a student stays home and takes an online class they really dont have anyone to ask for help if they dont understand a topic.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they dont have to wake up early, it is an alternative if the student doesnt feel safe at school, and they would be less stressed. Taking classes online are safer because you're in the safety of you're home and they wouldnt cost as much money as it would being at a public school. Overall, online classes would be a big help to students who are struggling to come to school. Lets start making this a reality then!                                                                                           ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4C083F3FA3EA,"As technology and digital devices improve, more and more schools have begun to utilize them by offering the option to take a class at home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to have an empty slot in their class schedule which results in students being able to come to school late or leave school early. Allowing students to take their classes by way of online or video conferencing would not be beneficial because students would be able to cheat more easily, it would be harder to communicate with teachers, and students would get more distracted in online classes than they would in school classes.

While the internet can provide long distance communication for a student to attend an online class, the internet can also provide the answers to assignments and work that the student may be assigned. If a student is allowed to take a class solely online, they will be inclined to cheat and look up answers. One counter argument that people have is that teachers have a way of seeing how many tabs are opened on the computer, but even if the teacher could see how many tabs were opened, the student could still use their phone or another digital device to look up answers. An online class would also make it easier to cheat because since the assignments would be all digital, students could utilize the copy and paste keys to look up answers quicker. If the student was taking the class at school instead, they could be given paper assignments and it would be harder for them to cheat. Online classes also make it easier for students to collaborate on assignments that they should be doing independently. Students could be using other students' help or they could be using previous students' work and it would be harder to identify.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because it would be harder to communicate with teachers. Some online classes may be taught by teachers who don't teach at the actual school the student attends. This makes it harder for students to ask them questions or ask for their help when they need it. This could cause students to not understand the topic completely and it might reflect in their grades. Online classes also make it harder for the student to build a relationship with the teacher. Because it is an online class, the student and the teacher don't really get to know each other and this could cause their relationship to be very weak. If the student was taking the in school class, they would have a stronger relationship with their teacher because the student would get to physically see and talk to the teacher every other day. The better the relationship between the teacher and the student is, the more likely it is for the student to go to the teacher and ask for help. Because the online teacher and student are not able to build a good relationship, the student might not ask questions to the teacher even if they don't understand the topic.

Another reason why online classes would not be beneficial is because students would be able to become distracted easier. Because the online class is done through video, teachers can not verify that there are no distractions present for the student. If the student was taking the class in school, the teacher would be able to see most distractions and could take them away. During an online class, the student could be able to use their phone away from the camera and the teacher would not know. This can cause the student to not pay attention to parts of the lesson and cause them to not understand as much as they might in an in school class. The student might have other distracting factors at home that would have been controlled at school like siblings or pets. At school you can produce a more focused environment than you could by taking an online class.

Online classes have some benefits, but have too many flaws to be beneficial to students. The flaws of cheating, lack of communication between teacher and student, and distractions make online classes an ineffective method of teaching. The system of online classes could be changed to try and make it more effective, but there are too many sacrifices made when you substitute in person teaching with online teaching. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

If you had the chance to attend your classes at home would you take that chance? Most teachers in Generic_School agree that student get more experience and a better learning from actually going to school than attending school from home. I believe students wouldn't benefit from attending classes from home because there is more distractions and students can cheat without getting caught.

First, when attending classes from your home, there is more distractions in your home than there is at your school. For example, while in school you may have a couple students in your class who might start talking, but they can be removed so that you and other students can have a quiet learning environment; however, at home your brother, sister, mom, dad, or grandparents can cause a distraction while you are doing your class online and they wont be removed from that room or house that you share with them. Also, when having a class at home, people can be distracted by other things in your house such as: TV, Video games, chores, or even by other guest that are in your house to visit. In result, attending classes at home isn't beneficial for students. Attending classes at home not only causes more distractions, but they cause more cheating also.

Secondly, although attending classes at home can result in more distractions, it also cases cheating. Studies have shown that 49% of students use Google or Wikipedia in order to get answers on worksheets, test, and quizzes that the student is having trouble with at that time. In another words, attending classes at home will produce more cheating for those students who struggle on their assignments. To conclude, students who attend classes at home are more liable to cheat on a difficult assignment that they're struggling with.

Finally, many of students and adults have disagreed and believe that attending classes at home is more beneficial than going to an actual school. Many of adults believe that if students attend classes at home, then it can help and get them ready for the real world, but it can also help them get ready for collage. Studies show that over 56% of students want to attend classes from home because of other reasons such as: being able to sleep in, use there phone without being told to get off of it by a teacher, and even being able to play the game and do there work. To conclude, students and there parents believe getting ready for the real world can start now if teachers can agree to let students attend class from there home.

Students benefit more from going to school than attending classes from home. In conclusion, students benefit from going to school than attending classes from home because, there less distractions and less cheating.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A4FA2C4BB8C8,"Schooling can be a very arguable topic. Some students learn in varying ways and can focus really easily, while others can not focus and have trouble learning. With school students can learn the way they retain information easier and prepare for what is to come. Distance learning through online classes can be very difficult without having face to face interactions, distractions, and the bad learning environment.

Schooling is very important for children to learn life lessons they will use for their adulthood. Taking them away from public or private school will not help with communication skills. Stripping away communicating in person can make the individual very awkward in public situations. For example, if you have never had experience in face to face or do not have much practice it could be hard to read body language. When talking in person you can connect with someone and maybe make a bond. That way you won't be afraid to ask questions and get the help you need from faculty and staff.

In school you learn a lot of workplace readiness skills. When you are behind a screen it is really hard to learn to work as a team. With the in person view you can learn these skills very easily and quickly so you can use them in adulthood.

They say home is where the heart is, but staying at home all day can be a real challenge. Would you like to be cooped up in your house all day? No! Some students houses are not pleasant working environments. People have responsibilities they have to take care of. When you are at your humble aboard you start to worry about everything you need to do rather then the online schooling. With that, as sad as it may be, people could be having really tough times at home. At school for some people lunch is their only meal they get for the day. To some students school is a safe haven where you can get away from the house and actually be yourself. When converting to online schools you take away that opportunity for students.

With all the responsibilities at hand there comes distractions with it. One of the most prevalent being our phones. In class the teacher usually can spot you on your phone and tell you to get back to work or put it away. Without the teacher there you can stay on your phone for hours. One of my friends takes online classes and is behind by two years because she never does her work and is always on her phone. Do you want everyone to start doing that? That being said procrastination is another thing that really effects students. Usually teachers are their to remind you about certain thing that needs to be turned in but without the discipline to start your work or finish it in time students will fall behind and lose track of dates and when thing are to be turned in. When you are at school, public or private it does not matter, classrooms are made so the distractions are very minimal. With the desks in line, quietness of the room, and the teacher curving you back to the task at hand. At home you can easily be distracted.

In conclusion, Online schooling is not very beneficial for students. Some students need school to get away from the house. From being very distracting and not a good work environment, to not having the face to face interactions people need to learn communication skills. You do not have the right requirements to learn in that state. Behind the screen not being able to ask questions. School is a very safe environment for students to excel in their classes and be prepared for the rest of their lives and their future careers.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
2FA2ABCDD456,"Growing up as a kid, you had all your friends that you would hang out with everyday and always have a smile on your face, don't change that now. School can be stressful at times and when it was, you would make plans to go out with friends or just spill your thoughts to them, sometimes you just need a break. There is no reason to isolate yourself from the world, you will not benefit from that. always live your life to the fullest. The idea that students can benefit from taking classes at home is invalid because students need a social life, friends are always useful when you need them and another reason is that being home schooled can promote laziness, with no clubs or sports in your presence, students will have no interest in anything and lose motivation to do anything after they're done with their classes.

Having a social life can help you in many ways, why get rid of that? When taking classes at home, who are you gonna talk to? Once you're done with your classes, you'll be alone with no one to socialize with. Socializing is probably one of the most important things for teenagers. Having a social life will help your mental state and give you something to think about that isn't school. Having a friend can help you have someone to talk to when you need to, everyone has their bad days and you just need to let it all out, not everyone is comfortable with their family so having a friend can be very useful. Also learning with friends or even people just around you can help you learn better, you won't just be hearing yourself but you will also hear other people's thoughts which can help you gather more information and create more ideas. Lastly socializing can help students grow their character, you won't be able to grow without people being there for you and helping you.

Being home schooled can promote laziness which can affect students in many ways. If you're home schooled, what are you gonna do after you are done? There are no clubs or any activities for you to join, with nothing to catch your interest, you are more likely to end up staying home and do nothing that involves physical activity. With nothing to do, you will end up being lazy to do anything. If students are not active then their health will end up bad and could possibly start some bad habits. Students are too young to be facing any health and mental issues. Students need to be active everyday and taking classes at home does not help with that and can start them to be extremely lazy.

There are some people that claim that being home schooled can be beneficial. A reason why taking classes at home can be beneficial is because there won't be any distractions, so that means that students will mainly just be focused on their work which will help them maintain high grades which helps the student feel accomplished. Another reason is that students don't have to worry about what to wear, students don't have to fear about getting bullied for what they wear or what they look like and bullying can harm students really bad at the point where they can develop depression. The last claim is that students don't have to eat school lunch which some people don't like and they can just eat home cooked meals.

In conclusion the idea that students can benefit from taking classes at home is invalid because students need a social life and taking classes at home can promote laziness. There is no need to stay home and learn from home all by yourself, you can't learn a lot by yourself and you also can""t develop as a person. Being home after being done with classes will make you lazy and eventually get worst, students need to be active and experience new things. Being home will not help you discover new things.

E22D53ADC06A,"Over time, technology has become a major part of people's lives. Consumers have found ways numerous ways to simplify their lives as creators continue to advance technology through the development of new softwares, programs, and devices. As the world modernizes and becomes more reliant on technology, some school systems have begun incorporating more technology into students' lives by distributing laptops to every student. These school laptops are equipped with a video camera at the top of the screen and they're specially programmed to have all the resources students need in order to see teacher announcements and complete assignments whether they are at home or at school. Some schools have used these laptops to their full benefit by offering students the option of attending classes through video conferencing from home. Students benefit from having the opportunity to attend classes from home because they will be faced with less distractions and they can operate on a more flexible schedule.

Providing students with the option of attending classes from home will reduce the amount of distractions they face. In the school building, students experience interruptions or distractions during class every day. Often times, the disruption is caused by peers talking loudly to one another. Students enjoy seeing their friends in classes so they will begin conversing, but pretty soon they'll become too chatty and the teacher has to pause her instructions in order to tell the select group of students to quiet down. This effects everyone in the classroom, including the teacher. The select group of students who were talking are distracted because they're too busy chatting instead of focusing on the lesson. The rest of the students in the classroom are also faced with disruption because their learning has been interrupted. If students were to attend class through video conferencing, then this would reduce the amount of talking going on because students will be alone. This allows students to focus all of their attention onto the teacher and the lesson that is being taught. Another popular distraction in the classroom is the abuse of cell phone usage by students. Most students have their phones in their pocket or on top of their desk during class. As soon as they receive a notification, they're tempted to check their phones. Teachers have to continually tell students to put their phones away because this derails their attention from the teacher and the lecture or instructions that are being given. Through video conferencing, teachers will be able to see the student's surroundings and work space at all times, so the student will be less inclined to check their device and devote more of their attention to the teacher's instructions.

Students are able to attend classes on a flexible schedule if they're given the option to attend classes through video conferencing. Students are faced with strict bell schedules when it comes to attending school in person. Lots of students take part in extra-curricular activities that happen after school so they'll come home late into the evening and still have lots of homework to do. In order to finish all of their school work on time, students have to stay up late at night and lose sleep. In the mornings and during school days, students are drowsy and unable to properly focus. Having to operate on a strict schedule like the ones in schools can become difficult for students with busy schedules and will result in many tardies or absences in their attendance. With the option of attending class through video conferencing, there are less time restrictions so students and teachers can set up a schedule that both sides can function with. This will reduce the amount of absences or class time that is missed so that students don't get too far behind when they miss class. When it comes to school, many students experience stress or anxiety. They may be worried about not completing an assignment on time or not understanding the topic that is being taught. Video conferencing allows both the student and the teacher to operate on a flexible schedule that may be better for the both of them. The amount of stress in students will decrease because they're in a more relaxed learning environment. In addition, the teacher is given insight on what the students specifically need so that they can properly assist the students with a topic or an assignment.

Attending classes through video conferencing from home will benefit the students because the amount of distractions will be reduced and the time schedule will be more flexible. Although the use of video conferencing has many benefits for students, many schools and parents fear that the program used to make these conferences can cause glitches. To solve this issue, schools require students to restart their laptops once a week in class in order to refresh the program and decrease the possibility of any technological issues. Distance learning is an innovative way for students to attend class and communicate with the teacher. As the world modernizes, school systems should adapt and implement something new like distance learning.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
DFA37BC88FA6,"I disagree with the school offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Because i believe that student would not be learn anything, and they will be not focusing on there class. Parents would distract them or if they have a younger brother they might go and play with him. Taking a online class you spent most of you time inside not outside, and that affects you health. Many students would not have any friend to pay with, because they will be not going into a school. Also, they won't be able to do activities, and they won't experience any new thing everyday. Students can learn something else by going to school.

First, A student taking a online class at home that might be difficult, because there would be a lot on noses for the student, and that will make him lose focus. Parent would ask the student to do favors for them if they are home taking online class. If a student has sibling that will not help the student to work on their class instead they might just go to play with his siblings. The student might have a hard time hearing the teacher or listing to the teacher, because their connection might not be that great. It's hard for a teacher to explain something online or video conferencing.

Second, students won't be able to do activities outside and they won't be having any fun with friends as well, because they will be taking classes at their houses. They are not going to be social with anyone except their teacher, and their health might become not so wonderful, because they will be spending most of their time in inside a house. Student will not reach their limits if they are learning at their house. If the student is talking to the teacher the teacher might not be able to understand the student and that will be horrible for both of them.

Third, the student can become unhealthy, because he or she will be inside most of the time studying. Also, the student will learn how to get on time at school or drive safe because ho or she will be going to a school with other kids. If the student goes in a school she or he will learn how to respect some else, and the student will learn more, like leaning about boundaries at school. If a student goes in to a school he or she might get in to a relationship and that will be good for the student rather then the student just staying home.

Student can improve his or hers skills by going to a school. Such's being more social, playful, and friend full.

Finally, By not going to a school you become more isolated and you dont't spend more time with friends. Sometime you don't understand your teacher or you can't learn by your self, because you can't hear the teacher or the teacher can't heir you. That's why you need to go to a school where you can learn with other students. Their are a fewer benefit from attending classes at home, and there are greater benefit when you go to school. When you go to school you have a lot of fan also you can talk with a teacher in person and show him your work or show something that you din't understand.

Overall their are more opportunities when you go to a school, you learn new things not like when you stay home taking a class. You spent more time with friends and the teacher can be more passion it with you. Learning online can heart your well being. And more people would rather go to school then taking a online class. It's more teachable if a student goes to a school. Students gain better abilities when they go to school. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A6CC10322C3A,"I would say i'm more towards the con's of taking online classes from home, but their are also pro's with that way of learning. I believe it's easier for students to learn at almost their own pace, where they can get a better understanding of the lesson. Because if it's an online class the student most likely wouldn't have to worry ab the teacher going to fast or not explaining it right. Only a few percent of U.S students are home schooled either for a reason or because it could be easier for him or her. If you want to be lazy all day you could and still take the classes, you won't have to get ready for school like you usually do.

Won't have to worry about missing the bus or not having enough time to eat breakfast. Most kids don't have enough time to eat anything before school so they either eat breakfast at school or just wait until lunch. The cons of having online school at home is that students can get distracted easily or get lazy and not end up even paying attention to the online lesson. Because let's face it when your on your bed doing work you get tired of doing it and take a break almost every 10 minuets. Just end up getting bored quick and just start doing something else. Not going to school misses the experience of learning with friends and other people. That's what makes school fun, able to see your friends everyday.

Yes, school can be boring most of the time but being able to talk to other, classmates interact with them, getting help by your favorite teachers or if you need to somebody to talk to every student has a guidance consular. You can't really get that being home if you don't like sharing your problems with your parents. Most parents have gone to work in the morning so you'll probably be alone or with siblings which can also be a distraction.

I think online classes should be more used college than high school offering online classes. The students are already using computers to take notes. But for high school students some maybe don't have laptops or cant afford to buy. Not every high school are able to give computers to students for their work etc. So for students that may consider taking these online classes would't be able to take it . My conclusion is that online classes could be a good thing for students but can also be a bad thing. If they slack off at home their grades are just going to be worse than they probably were in actual school. There's always pro's and con's to everything.      ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
079FDB42E429,"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or don't like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school.

Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home.

These online and distance learning classes can help students get back on track with school and catch up with their work that they missed. The students who want to be home schooled can wake up at anytime that they choose and do the work that is planned for them and the ones that don't like coming to school or the ones that get bullied can stay at home and get their work done without missing class and getting bad grades because of them not being their to do classwork or take test and quizzes. The students who are taking these classes can benefit from these a lot.

These programs can help students be able to their work on their own time and a have teacher who can teach them but online like at school and this can help students become independent in being able to do their work and help them stay away from trouble that they could be having at school and give them confidence to be able to do their work. I think this can benefit students because they are in the comfort of their homes and its like a regular class but it just online and you could get all your work done and by that you earn good grades.

If students who don't like coming to school,sickly and get bullied,always miss class and get bad grades because their are not their to take tests or quizzes then these online and distance class can benefit them to do work at the comfort of their home. It will also persuade them to not give up on school and give them a right to get their education before they throw it away. These online classes and distance classes can help teach these students as if they were in school and if they work hard enough they can get good grades. These are all reasons why these programs can benefit student.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BF960F59D07C,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I do not think that students would benefit as much as they should by using this sort of learning tool. The idea of offering distance learning is not bad, it just doesn't seem like it would work to me. There would be too much work for teachers to keep up with both students at home and students at school, it isn't worth the effort. The effort of integrating this type of learning into school would be a wasted one.

What if it works? What if there was a good way of making distance learning to work? I dont think it matter if there was a way to do it, because I don't think that most students would do it at all. Students are already tired of the day in day out routine of going to school everyday with the exception of the weekends of course. I think if kids in high school or middle school are stuck at home, they would just rather relax, and who is it say that students might play games or do something else while in the video call with the class, it is possible to happen.

Long distance learning through online video calling a class would not work as good as being in the classroom in person. As opposed to the video conferencing, a student can raise their during a lecture or notes to ask question in a quick and swift manner as, on the other hand; students in a conference call with a teacher would most likely take longer and not to mention the student would be most likely to not ask a question at all. Another problem with this video conference way of teaching from home to school would be the problem of students talking over each other, when in a call with multiple people it could be chaotic and a mess for the teachers to teach efficiently. What if a students internet goes down and they are disconnected from the call and can't participate in the class? Or what if a student has to leave for something important whatever it may be? video conferencing just wouldn't work for students and teachers.

You may be asking: ""what about sick students that would like to learn? they could benefit from doing online video conferencing with a class."" That may be true that sick students can benefit and it would seem smart, but, sick students need their rest. If students have to be up in the morning till afternoon working at home while they are sick they would never get better. Unless a student is brought down with a long term sickness that could last longer than a month, then I don't think that they should use this method of learning from home.

In conclusion I believe that video conferencing from home to a classroom would not be a good use of time for the students or the teachers.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
047BD3CB80B4,"Should students have the option to take online classes? Yes, I believe that students should have the opinion to take those online classes and that no one should take those classes away from those students. Students can be more active when they are at home then at school. You can pick a time to start your online classes and have a fixed schedule. It is important for students to have the education of there own way instead of worrying about how public/private schools are run.

Most students attend to focus more when they are taking online classes; For an example, Students dont have to worry about how teachers are teaching students when they are in a class full of other students. Students tend to struggle when teachers aren't teaching their students properly and care more about there monthly payments. Second example, is that having that one-on-one connection. Having that bond with your teachers are great ways to not be afraid to ask question when you dont get a problem or how to get the answers to the homework. Third example, most students tend to be antisocial at school because thats how they were born or even scared that people around them with judge the student and that the students wanna feel safe at school.

My second argument is that students tend to get bullied at school; Bullying is a huge thing around the world and that bullying is a serious problem; Bullying is the number one cause of student not attending to school and not getting the proper education they need: For an example, when the student is taking an online class, they dont have to worry about other students picking on him, but instead he can feel safe and really enjoy the education that he is learning online at home. There was this one time that one of my really close friends was being made fun of and picking on him everyday at school. He would sometimes not attend to school because he was too scared to come in to class and would always worry about the other students. He would not focus on his school work, but would mostly focus about protecting himself.

My Third argument is that students can ask question when they are having that one-on-one with the teacher. Students are afraid to ask a not so good questions in math, English, history, etc. Students have that nerve racking moment when a teacher tells the class if they have any questions. There was this one time that a teacher asked the class if there were any questions and none of the students raised their hands because I felt like everyone knew what they were doing in the class but me. I was having that moment that I didn't wanna waste the other students time about my question that I didn't understand on. It was the judgment that they would give me, but I know that it wasn't the case, people tend to over think about the problem inside the classrooms. For an example, Extroverts tend to not talk/socialized to people often, instead they don't talk to others and the problem that they are having trouble with and scared to ask the teacher because they feel insecure about talking or feel uncomfortable talking to others.

In conclusion, Students should have the option to take an online class and enjoy learning like everyone else should. Learning is a fun thing to do, but have different learning styles in life. The world keeps changing everyday now and new technology is developing overtime.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1B6D51980EDE,"Technology has become a crucial part of modern society. The online revolution has reached nearly every industry across the world. Throughout this movement, new industries and companies have been created that were never imagined before, and others have been made obsolete. In today's world, technology plays an important role in everyone's lives. For this reason, it is necessary that children be taught how to utilize technology. Although some believe that schooling should remain traditional, there is no better way to benefit children in today's age than introducing them to technology through online classes within their schooling. Online classes would instill critical life skills, such as self motivation, increase attendance, and prepare students for the work force.

Online classes are a great way to teach self responsibility within students. When taking an online class there is no teacher in the room making students get onto their computer and finish their work. Instead, they are responsible for motivating themselves to do so. Additionally, experts say that life long habits are formed at a young age. So learning to motivate yourself to get work done is a great skill to learn young. This will also help students learn to cope with procrastination. When students who have taken online classes reach college, their prior experience with procrastination will prevent them from falling behind like so many students do when, suddenly, there is no one looking out for them as their parents used to. Online classes instill self-motivation and responsibility from a young age, setting students up for future success.

Today's schools are plagued with attendance issues. Not only are students skipping school, but many others are forced to stay home sick, causing them to miss valuable education time and setting them back in class. This is prevalent today more than ever when entire school districts are closing due to the recent Covid-19 outbreak. However, if classes were online they would not be missing any schooling. Students could simply work from home and continue on their path. Some schools have adopted this, such as those in South Korea, where classrooms have transitioned to online until the outbreak passes. Another benefit to at home schooling is the ability to work at your own pace. Students would no longer feel left behind in the classroom, and encouraged to stay home because of it. In the same token, students who feel they are wasting time in class because they are so much faster than others, would have the ability to work at their own pace. In conclusion, online classes would increase attendance by allowing students a more flexible schedule and empowering them to keep participating even if unable to come to class.

Modern offices have rapidly transitioned to the internet in recent years. Companies who once required their employees to come into the office every day now allow them to work from home. Additionally, meetings that once occurred in person can now be done through online video conferencing. Modern jobs require workers to be flexible and able to work online. Some employees do not even receive offices anymore because they save the company money and simply are not necessary. Online schooling would give students experience in this modern work space. These students would be experienced in video conferencing and other necessary skills which will be required of them in the future. Additionally, students would have the benefit of working from home like many employees do today. Working from home would not only allow students to learn in a more comfortable environment, but, would also help solve the issue of over crowded schools.

In conclusion, empowering students to attend classes online and from home would help set them up for success in the future. Students would develop crucial life skills, as well as experience beneficial to the modern work space. Additionally, online education would save time and money for students and schools alike. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5BE6F3FD90DB,"Online learning would be useful to the student's who struggle in school not because it is hard, but because the environment of the school is just not suited for them. Some kids struggle talking to adults or making friends or even just the thought of presenting gives them so much anxiety they end up not dong well just because of not presenting. One friend of mine recently moved away to another school and the thought of starting over junior year, making new friends, having to build new relationships with all new teachers just gave her so much to think about and too much anxiety and just all around stressed her out. The first day came around and I heard about the chatter and the looks that she got and she already knew that this year was going to be hard, and the fact that she is already a struggling student added on to the awful high school experience she knew she was about to have.

Highschool is not at all like what you see in the movies, don't get me wrong it is for some, but it's very few kids who actually have the perfect high school experience. For the students who don't have that experience and struggle more, online or video chatting with a teacher so they can get one on one help would help with easing the anxiety and pressure. Also the kids who need more attention than others can get the help they need without feeling like they are interrupting the whole class or feel embarrassed because everyone else understands what's going on but them. Having the feeling of comfort is important while learning because if the student is not comfortable then they tend to drift off and not pay attention and when they don't pay attention they end up not learning. Doing online school gives the comfort and that safe feeling of knowing what you are doing and when to do it without feeling tense about being late to class, seeing someone you got into an argument with or even something that happened two weeks ago and it's still on your mind because you see that person every day.

However, not going to high school can be a bad thing because you would not get the highschool expierence good or bad. Not interracting with people and staying in your room all day doing nothing is bad for you because that student would have no life outside of the house. Everything they need is in the house so there would be no reason for them to leave which means no sunlight, highschol sports, new friends, social skills or anything. Social skills are the main thing to be worried about because they are needed for a good job. My mom is a realtor and interacts with people evry day and she tells me all the time when I do not want to go to school anymore she reminds me of my friends and I would be bored all day not talking to anyone because they are all in school. School is a major stress but even if it is bad it gives you a sense of what a job is going to feel like when school is over.

In the long run I think yes for the few ammount of kids that struggle with school it would be beneficial because not everyone learns, thinks or feels the same way at school. No one knows what goes on at everyones homes and everyone is so quick to judge and make opinions and its so easy to put others down, and when one of these students finally snaps, most of the time they will assume it is the home life but in reality it's being at the place that makes them feel not wanted that makes them flip out. I think kids should have the option of online school if school makes them feel that bad and just not want to get up in the morning and every day it is the sme struggle, same stress and same people, they should get to choose. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4722B4D2C6E7,"In the United States, every student is required to receive a K-12 education. Since technology has become such a big aspect of people's lives, many schools have started to offer online classes. This means that students have the ability to attend their classes from home. With the ability to learn from home, people have started to discuss whether or not this opportunity is beneficial for students. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because schools create a good environment for face-to-face help, there are less distractions in schools, and schools promote projects to improve life skills.

First, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because schools create a good environment for face-to-face help. Although technology has made many daily tasks easier, school is a place that shouldn't be taken lightly, and has endless advantages. One of the biggest advantages of taking classes at school is being able to receive help from peers and teachers whenever a student needs it. This may not seem like much, but having the opportunity to get face-to-face help whenever it's necessary can make a big difference on a student's academic success. Not to mention, there are minimal distractions in school that make learning easier than at home.

Next, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there are less distractions in schools. A student's home is a place for relaxation and minimal work. When a person thinks about relieving stress at the end of the day, they think about going home. At home, it's easy to get distracted by the little things. It may just be a pet or the TV, but all of these things result in taking important learning time away from a student's day. At school, a student doesn't have time to get distracted. Lessons are taught and good amounts of work are assigned so a student stays busy. For example, if a student that learns from home has to write an essay, they are more likely to get distracted by the things in their home then get it done. However, a student that learns at school would get their essay done, knowing that it's easier to stay on task then get behind because of distractions. Having less distractions isn't the only positive of learning at school though. A student also gets to work on projects that will help them in their future lives.

Lastly, students would not benefit from learning from home because learning at school pushes students to do projects, which improve life skills. Projects have always been a way for students to collaborate with their peers. It may not seem like much, but projects teach teamwork, leadership, and knowledge skills. Projects also emphasize the importance of making friends and compromising with others to achieve success. Learning from home deprives students from working with their peers. The only way a student gets to be in contact with another person is if a student is video conferencing a teacher or staff member.

Some people may say that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Attending classes from home makes it easier for students to get an education without having to commute to schools. Not to mention, if a student didn't have to commute to school, they would have more free time to do extracurricular activities. However, students would not benefit from learning from home because schools offer face-to-face help, minimal distractions, and project-based learning that helps students learn essential life skills.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6504F77A1674,"Some student would love to work on school work at home, due to the lack of sleep and possibly health issues. Working from home can teach students what its like to be independent and responsible. Some students wake up to being home alone in the mornings, some students have parents home or siblings home in the morning. Online classes would help students work at their own pace, along with teaching them how to be responsible. Some kids are just not motivated to get up in the mornings to go to school and deal with the same situation over and over again. As one of those students i feel as if online schooling would help the kids who are having a hard time getting up in the morning, to go to school and deal with stressful and anxiety inducing situations.

Students who have a hard time finding a reason to get up in the morning, hard time finding motivation, would probably prefer to do their school work at home. Some students and social anxiety, some suffer from depression, and some suffer from sleeping issues. We need to keep in mind that not all students are the same and all have a personal life to include some issues here and there. Some students may have tried to talk about this and no one has acknowledged their idea, which causes them to be more stressed and feel dismissed. Being one of these students i would also like to share that doing school online may be more stressful to some students, but others would much rather deal with the stress of doing online school than go to school and feel dismissed.

Students have to go to school and deal with people bullying them, and deal with other students that have no respect what so ever. Some kids dont want to be around that or have developed problems due to having to deal with bullying or feeling alone and dismissed. Many kids get up in the morning and face all of that head on and dont speak on the issue because they want to get it done and over with, but little does everyone know that a person can only take but so much of the same thing before it becomes a major problem not only for them, but for others as well. Students and kids should have to feel the way that they do growing up into an adult, some people say ""you're learning how to be an adult.""

Students, to include me, would feel way more comfortable working from how, rather than coming into school and dealing with the same situations over and over again. The skills it takes to learn online would help older teens and young adults learn what its like to be responsible for your own things, without teachers giving them the free pass. If you dont have something you need for online school than you cant learn, causing you to fall way behind and more likely to redo the class.

Not only will students learn the importance of being responsible, they'll also learn the importance of time management. Young students should be able to learn without feeling like they have no choice. Students who are on the line of becoming 18 and up should be able to have a say in their education.

We also have to keep in mind of students home situation, if the student is becoming or is 18, we need to think about their home situation. Some of them might not have a home or parents to help them. If they go through the school they should be able to do online schooling. With that being said I feel as if student should be able to choose to finish high school online, as well as be able to express why they'd feel better off doing online school. A student choosing to do online school seems so much better than a student choosing to drop out in my opinion. I feel like the online school option would reduce the number of drop outs by a lot.

Students would feel like they have a say in their education along side being heard. The amount of school days being missed by student would go down as well because they wouldnt feel pressured into doing something they have no interest in doing. Graduation number would go up due to more students participating in classes even if its alone schooling. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9AE88E64DF4C,"Would it be surprising to know that kids that learn at home don't have to stress as much? Stress is mainly caused by students getting to much school work that cannot all be handled in one night. Everyday kids complain about having too much homework and when working in home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at home gain more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeed and have better grades. Not only does learning at home provides less distraction,it provides student with flexible schedule.

One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime. Because it can be done at any time,children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. The student can work around the parent schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule. Some students have trouble working around at a school because they cannot understand the materials at the place set by teachers. Homeschooling allows student to work at their own place and at their own schedule. Another thing about homeschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of working about the rules,the student can focus on their studies.

When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would be a benefit for students. Learning from home won't be a distraction that a classroom has. As a result of this,students won't lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reason students get distracted in the first place i because they are in an environment that they are not familiar with,which makes them feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. In a school,you are stuck at desk for6 hours and have limited time to eat and limited bathroom break. this does not help a student's learning at all. on the other hand,if you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want and when you want. Because of this students will feel less pressure and get better grades than they would have if they were at school. In conclusion,the environment at home will benefit students by giving them better grades.

There are still a few not to do schools from home. there are much more opportunities with public schools. People from different colleges don't go to students' homes and try to advertise their career options. It's also pretty hard to make friends if you stay at home every day. Public schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to do schooling,funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools,depending on the teacher,cheating is hard to do. But schooling at home,the student easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device.

Students should be offered classes online because the environment is less stressful,which could benefit test scores. at home there are less distractions,rather than at schools where there are many different things to worry about. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Socialization and development wee factors when deciding a viewpoint on this topic. Though socialization is an inevitable part of the school environment and experience,the conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could effect the student in adulthood. Many students successfully take some,and even all, classes from home. School systems and all districts should offer distance learning.              ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8A11B24EEE66,"For the schools offering distance learning, you rock! As a high school student sometimes it is hard to complete a class in school, and I like the idea of having the opportunity to take one from home. I feel many other students would too. In my opinion, I feel like students would benefit greatly from distance learning because, students grades will improve drastically in a shorter amount of time, students could feel more comfortable and will be able to get more work done, and schools could save more money over the long run.

First, students grades will improve since they can do more from home. If a student is unable to get their work they will not be able to do it on time or sometimes they would just decide to not communicate with their teacher when they return to gather any makeup work. With this option they can always have their classwork and or homework readily available. By having it readily available they can get it done a lot sooner. Being able to get your work done on time instead of having a bunch of makeup work is also a rewarding feeling. Distance learning can have students not rushing to make up their work in the class offering it.

Second, students could benefit from this by feeling more comfortable while doing work from home. Many students have anxiety and do not like being in the school environment. With this option, they will be a lot more relaxed. In my personal experience I get more work done from working at home in the same amount of time it does for me to be in class. Plus, if students don't have to show up to every class in school then they will just be more productive overall.

Last, schools would definitely end up saving more money in the long run. It cost a lot to buy the basics every student needs. Don't get me wrong having to pay for this equipment would be pricey, but after buying the equipment eventually schools will begin to save a more money. The more we transition to online school the more we save on things such as; paper, pencils, desks, etc. And I also think that a teachers salary should go up with the increase of money being saved.

Now I'm not saying this should completely take over every class because some classes should still remain in the school, such as, gym and other more hands-on classes. But, several classes need should defiantly have this option. Because if every class had this option there would be no point in having a physical school built or used. Plus, it is hard to have hands-on assignments done from home done. And this could also go down-hill for students who don't use their time wisely because with this extra time who knows what they will end up doing, but I feel like majority of students do use it wisely and want to be able to succeed in life.

In conclusion, I feel like students would benefit greatly from this because, they will be able to improve and keep their grades up, they will feel more comfortable and can get more work done, and overall schools would just save more money after a while. So, all schools should offer distance learning! It, to me, is a great form of learning and many students will highly appreciate having this as an option. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

oes being home school damage students education? Yes, because most home school students social skills isn't well develop, being at home can be an distraction to their education, and limits educational activities.

After high school in the real world social skills are the key to having a successful life, everywhere you go people are going to be around. High school is suppose to guide students on the right path of a successful life, teaching students how to properly save and spend money, being responsible by turning your work in on time, and much more skills you need in the real world. Being home school may hurt someone social life which effects the social skills being develop, someone not having a social life could be depressing and lonely. Getting a job could be exhausting at times if someone doesn't know how to communicate properly, the first interviews are the most uncomfortable situation. Because the hiring manger wants someone who knows how to work well with people, being able to communicate with your boss and employees are very important.

However home school students could get distracted from school work easier than a student being distracted in school. Cellphones are the biggest distraction in society right now, you could be on your phone for hours and not know it. For not being around teachers physical it's harder for students to stay on task, teachers constantly have to remind students to behave, and do their work. Do you really believe a home school student can stay on task all the time? It's impossible for a teen to not get a little distracted, especially being home all day. Teens have their televisions and cellphones, being at school limits students to watch televisions or be on their phones.

School open eyes to many students trying to find themselves through educational activities, music, sports, art, and clubs. In schools you always have an option of trying something new, because of the verity of things in school to pick from. Also, determent the liking of something that could become into a future career. Being home school limits that experience yes, you could find something of your liking out of school. But its easier when all these options are at one place.

Therefore being home school is damaging to students learning and their social developed, students are better in schools because of the teachers they have for role models. Having someone to remind you of staying on task, getting your work done is very helpful. Nobody is perfect there are distractions everywhere, but having encouraging adults around is amazing. Social skills are very important for having a job and being able to fully communicate with people. High school really help students finding their life paths.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F666D2588232,"In my opinion, online school wouldn't be good for a kid. Kids in public or private school interact with kids all day everyday of the week so its normal for them to be social around other kids. Also, kids who do online classes at home, they have more of a chance to be awkard when around people since they don't see people besides the video conferencing.

Parents might think home schooled is better but for the most part, its only hurting the kids socail skills and they may not be fully understanding the stuff being taught. It's been proven that kids learn better around other kids and it espicually helps when they are actually seeing what they are being taught. Kids learn alot more together then alone, kids who go to public or private school, develop the knowledge to learn and start friendships, field trips, recess, and best of all, field day.

Another reason i think online classes aren't beneficial for students is because online classes require to much time staring at a computer screen and not enough interacting with real humans. All of this is more devestating to the brain then beneficial in my opinion. Kids just need other kids around to function sometimes, another person who can match their own energy 24/7. Students in home school just wont get the most exciting childhood in a sense.

In conclusion, kids who are in a public school or private school tend to be more social and more outgoing then kids in home school,they also tend to learn more as a group and just have a better time learning",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
879F973C6DF6,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to wake up in the morning and complete your school day straight from your bed? As a matter of fact, some schools have begun to offer distance learning, which allows students to particapate in classes from home via online or video confrencing. This idea has had many people on the fence, saying that it could lead to students becoming more lazy and unmotivated in academics, but I disagree with that entirely. I believe that a good portion of students would bennefit from having online courses because it gives them a low stress environment to wok in (if the home is a safe place for the student), and it allows for students who are away on travel or bed ridden from an injury or illness to stay up on school.

School can be stressful and very overwhelming at times. It is scientifically proven that a school environment causes unwanted anxiety and unneccesary stress. I believe that allowing a student the chance to work from home, if it is a safe place for them, would create a very positive outcome. When you give these student's positive stimuli by letting them work in a stress free environment, they will be incentivised to be more productive, and their overall work will be more thought out and well executed. Stress is very big factor in the life of a student, and if you were to help eliminate it that persons overall life would become alot easier. There are also other great uses for this system aswell.

Staying up on your school work is a very vital piece to a student's success in school. If you they behind on work, it can sometimes be a huge challenge to get back on track. That is why I feel that this system would also be very helpful to students who are bed ridden with an illness or injury, or even a student who is away traveling. Most times, when a student misses school they have to make up what they missed from the days they were absent. This forces them to have to balance to much, by not only continuing with their ongoing work but also having them focus on their missing work at the same time. If a student had the available option of distance learning, they could stay actively engaged in the class aswell as recieve immediate help on whatever they needed; moreover, this would allow for an oppurtinity to never fall behind again. These opputunities are all very positive; although, there is still a worry about some student's work ethics suffering or the system not accomodating to everyone.

Many people are concerned with the thought of students becoming lazy and unmotivated by using the distance learning system. This is a very valid claim for a variety of reasons. Students could become overly dependent on the system, causing them to abuse it and consequently miss school even more. There is also the possibillity of students completely disregarding their work, and instead of being productive they could lounge around all day. As I previously mentioned, some students homes are not safe places for them to work in, and this plan would not accomodate them very well. This system has a lot of potential, but as you can see there are still many downsides to it.

The distance learning system is a very unique and potentially very useful system; however, there are still some kinks that need to be ironed out before it can be used to its fullest potential. If the schools can find a way to safely and efficently regulate this system, there is no doubt in my mind that this could be a revolutionary step in education, by giving students a stress free environment and a way to stay caught up on missed school work. This marks a bright day for the future of learning.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
EDC567D40996,"Students from all around the world attend schools in various locations, under different stress levels, and with an array of goals pertaining to each student. We live in a technology dependent society. From cellphones to laptops, we hold our lives and personal history on these devices, therefore, considering how helpful it would be, computerized schooling should also be offered on these devices. When attending an online course all of these details are wiped clean, simply a name with a passing or failing score besides a computer generated ID, for some this could be considered unnatural, unhelpful, and in broad terms wrong. I disagree with these notions because online schooling is extremely beneficial for the same reasons some may consider it harmful. Online classes are beneficial to students because they directly cater to a students schedule, they are helpful to students in terms of distance, and they offer another option to students who may experience mental and physical health issues as well as bullying.

Job's, career's, and responsibility's, all things that students may have to take into consideration when attending traditional schooling due to their schedules, when given the option to choose between a traditional or a modern solution, the majority would choose a more modern option for a more custom fit. Students would be given a due date on their assignments and a lesson plan on the material, leaving them free to decide when to complete these tasks. A very close friend of mine happened to be in this exact scenario due to his soccer career. Once he had informed me that he made the switch to online school, I could see a different version of him, he was truly a stress free individual when it came to his education because he could attend his classes through a screen. Some may say this would cause a student to ""slack off"", but that's incorrect. Regardless of online or traditional schooling, the choice to attend is solely based on the student and their goals; having it be online or through video, has no effect on this. My friend chose online school for various reasons, another reason for his decision was the distance between him and his school because of his travel.

Distance, it's a large issue for the majority of our population whether it be work or relationships, although not many consider it, the distance issue also applies to schooling. Students live in all types of conditions all around the world, making it difficult to reach a traditional school at sunrise, only to make their ""voyage"" back eight hours later. This could also be because of travel due to careers, an issue my friend struggled with. Online schooling is an easy solution to both of theses issues and is very similar to homeschooling in this event. Students can reach their goals directed at their education without having to struggle through finding a way to attend classes. It could be argued that a bus would be available to pick up students and take them home once school is over, but for some, a bus is a luxury that they don't have. This could be due to the distance between the school and the student in which some distances buses cannot travel. It could be argued that parents or students may drive to their school's location but a full tank of gasoline and personal use vehicles are not widely offered within families. Along with distance issues, mental health issues, medical conditions, and bullying can also add to a students list of reasons as to why online school is beneficial.

In a world in which mental health is taboo and medical conditions along with bullying are downplayed, an online education is an easy solution to these problems. It has been said that around 47% of students struggle with conditions such as depression, anxiety, social anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder or a physical disability. All of these conditions make attending school a grueling activity for most. Whereas an online education defeats all of these scenarios. Whether it be a hospital bed, a therapist's office, or even your own kitchen, online school is widely available to all whom are living a double life. Bullying rates for teens and children only seem to be going up, this negatively impacts a student so greatly, that they may feel like school isn't something they could handle on a day to day basis. Some may say that mental health and physical disabilities as well as bullying can be handled in a school environment by counselors and special exceptions that may be offered but this is simply false due to the fact that most school counselors aren't trained in helping students deal with a debilitating disease making an online education a better fit for most students dealing with these problems. By having an education packed into a computer screen, students are then encouraged to take their lives into their own hands, taking all power away from any illness or bully.

Online school is an amazing option for all and should be treated as one. Students who accept this route are encouraged to be responsible and healthy, which are the most important things in ones life. Online school should be a choice given to all because of its various benefits. Online educations are extremely beneficial in cases of scheduling, distance from a traditional schooling location, and student illnesses or bullying. Education is something that our young population should be offered regardless of a predisposed disability, online school makes getting an education a level playing field for all. It is convenient and overall a marvelous opportunity and should be widely available for our student population. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
2ABFDA03AB4B,"To my view point, yes, because so the parent could stay more focus to theirs childrens, also, they could feel more comfortable in your house, Also, Some childrens that they like more privacity, it might be a good idea, some facility the technology, and this always will follow ahead, this could be a way of we go adopting to it. For example, if you need travel or to do something important that really need it, you can go to the sitweb and check what you must to do; another reaosn is that they will not need go with their bainder, you can go just with your computer, you would have more organization thank to the apps that the computer get and you could save your notes (today day many people forget the papers, and this is more easy to lose it), how the computer need some conection to wi-fi, you can navegate by red and search something that you didn't understand, the navegation have many way to facility you life. However, The teacher would put more atention to each students, because I feel that best expresion is writting and the teacher will gave more trust to the students and they are apen to talk with them, and the conection to talk will be better (curse talking in person is very different but they wouldn't open their mind, and they would a close mind, because some reason is that they are not feling liberty, some reason are their partners in your classroom), For this reason, I think that this will be a way easily to keep your ''good grades'' and the atention to the students wil better.   ",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2
1ED627A6FC40,"Technology is proving fast. People have many different new ways to get education. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes by way of online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they will get distract, have questions that can not be solve, and learn nothing without internet.

Student will get distract from learning at home. Some student have self control to learn, but most don't. They may doing another thing while learning, or fall in to a sleep. Student can play video game and the teacher will not notice. For example, kids are the fast learner on computers. My brother who is in second grade, he's English class is taking online. During the lesson, he open up another window to play game. He divide the screen into two small screen, so one side is English class and the another one is the game that he like to play, and teacher do not notice that. Technology is a simple way to get education, but also is the way how students can ""cheat"".

Student may have question during the online class that can't get solve. Not anything online can give you an answer. My geometry teacher was absent on one day, and she made a video of the lesson we missed. During the video, I have a lot question, I tried to find them online, but I find nothing. I couldn't solve the question until I see her again. There is a lot simpler to learn in class because teacher will give you example to help you understand the question and give some practice of it, this way you can really learn and understand the lesson. Online class is just give you a lesson, when you have a question, you have no one to ask and no where to get help.

Online class will not work without internet. Some places have problem on internet, if that happen, student will not learn anything. My friend Generic_Name, who live in a town, has very bad internet at home, sometime the internet is completely dead. She have to take the classes online, but without internet, she couldn't do anything. That day she was so angry because she learned nothing, and she don't have a second option to get education. Therefore, online class is not benefit to everybody.

Some may say students would benefit from attend classes from home because they will get enough rest; however, they would not learn anything. Learning at school will let students be more success and helpful. School can develops many talent students by working together with teachers. Attend classes is the only and the best way that people get education because student will be more concentrate, understand everything they learn, and get education in many ways.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EC490F5D4DD8,"While attending a public/traditional school have very good benefits, some people don't do well in regular school enviornments. Having the option to take classes from home has bnefits that apeal to to people that dont learn well under normal learning circumstances.

If your someone that works or have other duties that get in the way of going to school, online classes gives you that flexability to learn from your home and so start and finish day-to-day lessons. Online classes also aliviates some the stress of balancing classes. Things like school events wather and days off won't effect your learning progression which makes finishing classes alot easier which gives you more time for other activities.

While online classes have great benefits there are some downsides. Most of the work is on you to comprehend, complete, and turn in on time. You also will be Isolated from other people and expiriences you can only have in a regular school. But while these are true they are easy to overcome if you are focused and determined.

Students all over the U.S. fail to do well in school because the types of benefits traditional school gives do not benefit the student(s) in the areas needed and in the the way that insures the most productive learning experience. Having alternative ways to gain accses to classes gives people that dont have the time to commute to a school a way to consistenly learn at there own pace.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
ADC46484D3B7,"Have you ever had to miss School? Whether you were sick, missed the bus, overslept, gotten injured, or you just couldnt make it to class. Whatever the reason missing class is not good and a lot of students miss class often. When students miss class it can cause them to fall behind and miss important material that they might need for later classes or tests. Missing class also means that you will then have to make up everything you missed and that can cause a lot of stress not only for students but for teachers as well. Distance learning will solve a variety of these problems and I believe that students will benefit greatly from it. By giving the students the opportunity to access the class online or by video conference you are helping students keep up with their school work, teaching them accountability and responsibility, and relieving stress on students.

Distance learning will help students to not fall behind on their work or in class. It is very easy to fall behind when you miss school it can make students feel lost,confused, and unprepared. When students are absent they are likely to have to come in early, stay late,and schedule appointments with teachers. They are also forced to work around their teacher schedules as well as their own. Getting behind on work can be really frustrating it can make students feel overwhelmed and unmotivated. But if the materials they learned in class that day are made available at home it solves the problem. Then students won't have to worry about not getting the work or missing the class because it is available online and they have access to it so, they wouldnt have any reason to fall behind.

Making the classes available at home benefits students and teachers by holding students accountable for the work as well as teaching them responsibility. Students will no longer be able to miss class and not be held responsible for the work because they have access to the material at home. This will hold students more accountable because there are no excuses and no reason to not do the work because they are no longer missing the class even if they are not there. Teachers will also be able to hold the students more accountable because even if they are absent they still have the tools to complete the work, but without the teacher physically being there the responsibility lies on the student. This will also help students not feel like they have all the responsibility without the proper materials and they will be able to do the work on time and not miss anything.

Lastly, distance learning will relieve students of stress and help them to not be as worried about missing class. Being a student is very stressful and as a student there are a lot of things that you are responsible for and or feel obligated to do. Keeping up with the work load is a big job and a job most students struggle with. Students have a hard time maintaining a balance and tend to become very stressed. Missing class is very stressful because when a student misses a class they then have to deal with all the things that go into trying to make up the work that they missed. If a student misses more than one class it is very easy for them to become overwhelmed and stressed. But with distance learning you are eliminating the stress of missing class because students will still be able to do the work. Therefore, you are relieving the stress.

Although some people may argue, distance learning is a great tool and something that all students could benefit from greatly. It makes life easier for not only students but everyone in the school program. It helps students keep up with the work, it promotes responsibility and holds students accountable, and makes life less stressful for students. Making classes available for students online is a great idea and i think all students should have the privilege of having distance learning.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
C865637A034A,"Students would benefit attending school from home in many ways.... students would be able to work in a quiet environment with no distractions from other students. Another reason why it would be better would be because, some students work in their own speed and won't be worried about how fast others finish. Sometimes students are more focused on who finishes first and sometimes think it's a race. students would also have the chance of working on their own time when they can,like that students could proprobly finish their work faster. Online school could also be better for students sleep schedule, like that students could be more rested and would be able to focus on their work.

Better sleeping schedule would help kids focus more on their work and would be able to stay up, whens students dont sleep well the tend for fall asleep in class. Falling asleep in class effects on class grades because student pay less attention. Having to wake up early and get ready on time is hard work,making it on time to school is a big task. Just having online classes from home would be better for everyone in general, would honestly make students life much more easier. Online school should just be a thing for students because its less stressful and much easier.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
CA62122BB195,"Have you ever had two tests, a project due and stayed up all night to finish work just to get up and do the same process again? If your answer to any of those were yes, you were probably a high school student. A solution to this tiring routine is distance learning. While some people are opposed to distance learning because they believe it changes the quality of education, distance learning can be extremely beneficial to students. Schools that offer distance learning are benefiting the students by keeping them safe, allowing students to have their own itinerary, and will help reduce student's stress.

The first reason distance learning will benefit students is safety. People have germs; when a bunch of people with germs get together, it brings a risk regarding public safety and health. If students stay home and attend classes online, it makes it harder to spread diseases, especially in situations where the diseases are airborne. One example of why this precaution would be good in today's world is the Corona virus. This virus can even be spread through air conditioning, by keeping students at home where they can continue to learn but stay safe is the best way to keep the health of the students intact.

Another reason that distance learning is the best option for students is they can work on their own time. When students can make their own itinerary, the quality of their work will improve. By allowing students to pace themselves can help with breaking down work and completing it all, without the stress of sitting in class and being assigned one thing after another all in a single class period. Every student has their own needs and way of learning, instead of lectures if students could get the material and learn it on their own, it would allow them time to focus on the things they don't know and get a more personalized education. Distance learning also provides students with learning in an environment school doesn't, an example is doing work on the patio on a nice day.

The last reason distance learning will improve the education of students is stress relief. There are so many different stresses students have to worry about, grades, clothes, other peoples opinions... All things that will not matter in ten years (except for the grades) however, these things can get distracting. By bringing the learning out of the classroom and into an environment where students can focus on the learning part of school, outside of school, students will be able to complete their work without all the extra. Creating a stress-free environment outside of school where students can balance school and life would be extremely beneficial to the overall school experience.

In conclusion, distance learning has many more pros than cons. The standard eight class periods everyday has been around forever, it is time for a change with new ideas. Giving students the opportunity to stay safe, pace themselves and reduce stress is something that needs to be at least an option for students everywhere.           ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
37B985859EB8,"I agree that this new use of online education would benefit students attending classes from home, as it would forcibly teach responsibility, time management and increase the students ability to become independent during their process life long learning.

Responsibility, the ability too be responsible and take complete control of your actions and tasks that you do. As students cling towards this new style of education they will be met with the lack of a teacher's or an professor's guidance. They'll have too get work done on their own. They will no longer have that reliable position of authority over their shoulder telling them what too do and how too do it. Instead they will be forced to learn responsibility, anywhere from getting homework done to studying for an exam. Their also responsible for being able too adapt too this new style of learning, therefore forcing them too find other ways too learn and interpret. For instance, as a a high school student, in the city of Generic_City Virginia, i personally have had too adapt too many different changes in my educational career. Transitioning from middle school to high school was definitely difficult

As I'm learning all this new information; i had too interpret it in a way too fit me and my process of thinking. Responsibility, being an every day part of life, is a big reason that i think this new type of education would help students, as it will help them out later on during life. Learning responsibility is one of the major reasons why I believe online education would benefit students at home.

Time management, using your time wisely, in order too get the most out of it. Online students doing work from home will not be in a class room for numerous amounts of hours on top of hours. Therefore,they'll be forced too use their own precious time in order too complete task and or assignments. Not only will they have too use their own time, but they will also have to learn how too properly manage that time. This could mean making a schedule, writing in a daily planner or even putting out reminders onto their cell phones. For example, as a high school student, athlete, as well as a working individual, I have to manage my time wisely so that all of my things are completely prepared to finish or finished. Time management being another key factor that would help online students at home, will definitely help towards the benefits. As students will forcibly have too learn this characteristic trait when they start this new style of educational learning. Which will help them prosper later on in their lives, additional educations or even in the career of their choosing. This is why learning time management could help benefit online education for students at home.

Independence, being able too function, completely finish activities or task all on your own, without any supervision controlling your thoughts movements, or actions. Just like responsibility students must learn how too be independent when having too do the work on their own.

As they won't have that professor or teacher too push them through it all. Instead the'll be taught to indecency and being able too do things on your own. Not being able too rely on another individual, they will be forced too learn this trait in being independent. For example , me being in high school i can not always rely on the teacher for any missing work. Sometimes i have take initiative and be independent and go to a class website, ask her after school or even ask another peer that also takes that class. Just like i might have t find out the information that i missed out on my own, they will have too find out he information on what they have to either turn in or even complete on their own. This trait of being independence is very critical to a person and how they live their life. As it is a major factor in our every day society. This is why i believe that being independent is a major reason and factor too help propel the benefits on online education for students at home.

In conclusion, i agree with the idea of this new style of learning in online schooling for students at home. It will properly benefit numerous amounts of students as it will provide them with tons of new traits. Traits like responsibility, time management, and as well s being and independent individual. this is why i believe in this new style of education, online education for students at home and why i support it and the traits that come from its, how it will benefit and propel our society in the future.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3.25E+11,"Ever since the invention of the telephone, our society has been marked with a series of innovations in the communications field. From texting to social media, technology has made it easier to communicate with each other with little to no latency from anywhere on the planet. One of the most recent applications of communications technology is through the education sector. Some schools offer online video conferences such that students can attend class from home. While many argue that they limit teaching ability and promote longer screen time, online classes provide enough logistical benefits such as cost-effectiveness and safety that they outweigh the criticism.

Running a school can be expensive. The school must be able to pay for general utilities, transportation, and safety for each and every student. Taking these factors into account, the school will likely be paying tens of thousands of dollars each day in order to function. This price contrasts heavily with that of online classes as the cost of an online class is typically only dependent on the technology needed to run it. The technology usually needed to run such classes can be broken down to a computer and access to the Internet. Computers have been rapidly becoming cheaper due to innovations in transistor design and other fundamental computational components. Furthermore, they are generally one-time payments as compared to utility costs that must be paid every day. The Internet has experienced vast growth in the last two decades as cell towers and broadband companies have become more abundant. As of right now, we have many developing countries that have gained access to Internet as reductions in costs have made broadband more accessible. If we consider that salaries for teachers remain constant for both in-person and online classes, the price for running online classes seem miniscule when juxtaposed with the logistical costs for running a school.

One of the most pressing issues in our world is the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The virus, which started in China, has quickly spread to the United States and has been infecting and killing many. Currently, no health organization has a vaccine for this disease, so the only solution is to isolate infected individuals and to stop local gatherings. One such place that a local gathering is constant is a school. Schools contain many students and staff from various age groups. These people are almost guaranteed to have interactions with one another, which isn't ideal during a virus outbreak. To solve this problem, school systems could use online classes as a substitute in order to protect their students. By allowing students to attend class from home, schools could limit the interaction that causes the spread of the virus. In fact, Generic_City Public Schools, whose county has already experienced a couple of positive cases of the coronavirus, has already created a digital plan in case the situation becomes more dire. This example of a virus outbreak clearly illustrates the advantage that online classes have in terms of the safety of the students as they are better protected in the boundaries of their own home.

Criticism against online schools often stem from the belief that communication with a teacher in-person is the best way to learn; however, that statement is becoming more false over time. As schools increasingly gain access to technology, they utilize certain software to increase their learning productivity such as Google Classroom and Microsoft Word. Both of these softwares often require students to have computers. Likewise, online classes share the same demand and produce the same educational result. Hence, the notion that in-person classes has better learning potential than online classes is false. Equipping this information along with the logistical benefits associated with online classes, it is clear to see that online classes provide a benefit for students.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
960C3510FA5A,"Almost every student who attends home schooled classes succeed within the programs. The benefits of the home schooled classes and success from students are shown through graduation rates. In addition,studies shows that students have less stress and social issues to worry about,at home. Also,home schooling could allow the students to make a schedule of their own. On the other hand,individuals think students would benefit more without the classes or attending public school. Public schooling does also bring benefits of both social and communication skills. Public schools also have the benefits of participation in extracurricular activities,such as sports and clubs. Although,both public and home schooling have a broad amount of benefits,home schooling is overall more beneficial.

Students tend to have less stress and social isolation issues from home. Many students of public school systems have been shown to have isolation issues with other students,which leads to stressful mindsets. The unobserved and unnoticed isolation issue,have frequently lead to sometimes self harm or committing suicide. In addition,the stressful issues on students also lead to lack in grades and failure of attendance within school. While,students taking home classes have been noted to be more comfortable in a recognized,safe environment.

Home schooled classes allow students to freely make there schedule. Students are enabled to modify class types and subjects. In addition,home schooled students are enable to choose there class times,on their schedule. In contrast,public schools only allow students to modify and switch classes ,based on the remaining available classes. Also,students within public schools aren't able to choose there own class times,and there given a routinely and orderly schedule.

Many individuals argue whether or not students would be more benefited in public or home schooled classes. Home schooling makes some of the best benefits of independence. Including,the home schooled benefits of being in a recognized,homely environment. However,public schools shares a broad list of benefits as well.

53B21C3A440F,"Technological innovations have changed the way students learn. There are now more accessible and faster ways to acquire information for projects, homework, and for classroom learning. Computers, cell phones, and tablets are beginning to be used more and more by school systems .

These devices can be useful in the classroom, but they do not help with certain crucial aspects. Online classes are not as beneficial to students as classroom learning since it does not develop student's social skills, nor provide materials that are necessary for them to learn.

Students who attend classes from home do not benefit socially. Group work is important because students learn how to compromise, communicate, and get along with different types of people. If learning is done online, they miss out on the opportunity to develop their social skills. Social skills are necessary in day to day life since we are constantly interacting with other people such as bosses, coworkers, and strangers, for example, at a grocery store. Students should be able to develop those skills throughout their school years so they can be successful in the real world. Moreover, classroom learning promotes comradery and friendships. Having friends in class makes learning more appealing and interesting. For example, debates and seminars develop critical thinking skills since other students can have a different, challenging perspective to share amongst each other about a topic; this causes them to respect each others opinions and promotes communication skills.

In addition, schools offer free materials and services that are not available at home. A copious amount of books are accessible in the school's library and can easily be checked out without the student needing to find transportation to the closest public library. Devices such as computers, printers, and laptops can be used by students to complete and turn in homework. Various teachers in schools have gone to college and are experienced in their subject and can go more in depth into learning material if a student did not understand it. Teachers can also explain topics in a way that allows all students to understand it since people learn things in different ways. For example, auditory and visual learners benefit from online classes more than students who prefer hands-on experiences. Schools also have enough funding to be able to provide outside-of-class learning such as field trips to museums and inviting guest speakers.

However, online classes can benefit students who have a busy life, are in need of credits, or decide that they want to take classes that interest them. Those types of classes allow students who need one or two more credits to graduate when they are supposed to rather than stay another year in school due to a few credits. For example, in IB schools, required classes, like a language class, may be taken online if the student's schedule does not allow them to fulfill that requirement since it is full. It is also possible for students to take online classes in the summer in order to make space on their schedule for next school year so that they can take classes that are intriguing to them. There are students who need to provide for their families at a young age but still want a high school diploma. Students who have jobs can take online classes with flexible times, so they can easily fit them into their daily life.

In conclusion, online classes do not benefit students since they do not develop social skills and allow for them to learn how to compromise effectively with others which is essential in the workplace. Materials such as laptops, books, and expert information is not easily accessible to a student that is learning online and is possibly going to cost money for them to obtain it. On the other hand, students who have to work in order to support their families benefit more from online learning. Students who only need a few credits to graduate or would like to be able to take non-required courses during school would benefit as well. Better technology has allowed students to be able to have the option of taking online classes, regardless of their personal obstacles, and promotes the importance of having a good education to all young adults.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3470DA60B592,"Sitting at a desk for seven straight hours is outrageous. It's difficult for students who have a short attention span to maintain focus in school and acquire all of the information they've learned from their teachers. This issue, however, has been significantly resolved by the impact of technology on education. Some schools give students the opportunity to attend classes and learn by accessing through an online medium from home. This way, students can manage their time wisely to not only gain focus from breaks but also other acquire benefits that could improve their life. Because students can have time to partake in valuable activities that could positively influence their college admissions and are enabled to improve their health, all without losing the motivation to learn, distance learning from home through online or video conferencing gives students a greater advantage over learning in physical classrooms from time management.

Online school stimulates students to participate in valuable activities, such as volunteering for the good of the community, acquiring a paying job to support their family's income, and getting an internship, since they are able to have free time from controlling their time properly. All of these aspects can help colleges to understand the students' personality to determine whether or not to have them to become a part of their institutions. For example, the University of Virginia would rather accept a high school student who had an internship in a medical field that they immensely wish to pursue than accept a student who had no exposure or experience in the medical field. This is because the college admissions can see the student's determination and confidence in oneself. As a result, the student who had a medical internship would have a very high chance of being hired as a physician assistant, for instance, once he or she is completed earning a medical degree from UVA. This illustrates how much an impact online schools can have on the future lives of high school students, by giving students an opportunity to manage their time properly to convince college to see the good side of them.

Despite that, online classes also gives students another advantage: sleep--the most fundamental aspect in a high school student's mental life. It's vital to understand that sleep allows students to be productive and energized to perform various tasks throughout their school day. However, preparing for physical school limits their amount of sleep. For instance, many high school girls take a long duration of time to in the morning to put on makeup, shower, critically match their outfit for the day, etc., for school, so they decide to wake up early to complete all of those tasks. This proves that these actions can reduce a tremendous amount of time of their sleep to get ready for school. On the other hand, the ability to stay in and attend classes online excuses students from doing all of these time-consuming tasks to get a sufficient amount of sleep. They can simply wake up and attend school with a click of a button.

Some critics may say that online classes encourage students to cheat during assessments, using their online resources without having supervisors to stop them. This causes them to lose motivation in learning. However, some schools require them to take their assessments in person which will thus motivate students to learn for their own good. For example, Generic_City Public Schools give students an opportunity to take certain courses online but require students to take their midterms and finals in person at a designated school with the students' online teacher. This way, students are unable to cheat during their exams as their teacher is constantly paying close attention of their actions, thus motivating them to discipline themselves and ensure that they are learning what they need to learn for their own benefit.

As students are able to manage their time wisely, attending online classes from home is tremendously beneficial for students, due to being able to have a healthier body and use their free time on important tasks that can help them build an attractive portfolio for colleges. It's crucial to understand that not only their education is important but also the students' life, including their future. Furthermore, high school students should take advantage of the new technology that the world has provided us, especially by taking certain classes online. Technology is constantly changing to make our lives easier, so it's reasonable to take advantage of what technology has given us.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
5032D57FC9F1,"Is taking online classes more beneficial than attending a class? Attending a class helps individuals not only be social with other students on campus but also be social with their teachers as well! Therefore, because of taking online classes, students would have a decrease in social activity. Another reason why taking online classes are not the best option is because of the use of technology. Technology has a major impact on human health. Therefore, taking online classes to taking conference calls, the use of technology can be deceiving. Student can cheat off an online test of they wanted too because they would have no one around them to confirm that they had cheated.

Technology is being used constantly throughout the world today however, it has a major impact on human health. For example, technology impacts eye sight by worsening ones vision to see correctly, plays a major part in cyberbullings which might lead to suicide, and distracts one while driving which leads to car crashes. Technology can be efficient at times when needed but also be inefficient too. For instance, going to bed late just because you were on your phone all night playing games or having a test the next day and being on your phone instead of studying for that one test. Staring at a computer all day taking online classes, tests, or even a conference call would be a major impact on ones body therefore, attending classes would be way more safer and efficient than taking online classes. According to many students in colleges today, they would more likely attend a class on campus rather than taking online classes. Would you like to stare at a computer all day or would you like to be in a class were you can verbally learn and talk to your peers?

What if you were taking an online test and you have the resources to cheat would you? No one would be around you to confirm that you cheated or not. This would become a lot easier for a college student that is taking online classes rather than for a college student attending classes no campus because the students attending classes would not have the resources needed to cheat. If the kids attending classes cheat they are suspended for that college but what if the online kids cheat? Would they be of the hook? Today, I see students from my high school cheat when no one is around, those students that cheat will carry on old habits. Making students much more incapable of taking a test on their own. I feel that students that cheat from high school while sign up for online classes so that school would become much more efficient to them.

Being social is important, while in school or out of school! It's highly important to be social when you are going to college or going to a new school. Taking online classes prevents you from being social therefore, attending a class will help you be social with friends, teachers, and other students on campus. You have to be social when make friends or introducing yourself to teachers. The only way you can be social when taking online classes is when you are having a conference call.

Being social, the impact of technology on human health, and the many ways students can cheat online rather than in the classroom all are the reasons why online classes should not be recommended to anyone and should be banished for all campuses. At the end of the day its one opinion on if online classes are beneficial or not. I believe that some students just don't have the social functions to want talk to anyone and decided to do online classes instead of attending the classes in person.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
19157F773204,"Are your students struggling to attend class on a daily basis and can't keep up with their work? Well, we are here to help. By doing online schooling, not only would students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, but because the students can go at their own pace, have no distractions, and have a better and more comfortable work environment.

However, some people might disagree with this and say students do not gain or benefit from attending an online class at home rather than attending to a public school. Others might say this because there are no distractions at public schools and the students can still go at their own pace. For example, students can still go at their same pace in the classroom because if the teacher is going too fast, then the student can tell the teacher to slow down. Nevertheless, there are other view points to consider.

To begin with, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes at home because students can go at their own pace. For example, while students are at home doing their online school work, they do not need to rush themselves and they can take it at the pace where they learn the material accurately and in the most effective way possible. Therefore, this would result in the students to attend their online classes more often because they are understanding the material while going at their own pace.

In addition, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes at home because there are no distractions. For example, by students not having any distractions at home because they are doing online work, this would help increase productivity and minimize side conversations rather than going to a public school. By doing this, the students doing online work will turn in their assignments on time which will help them in the near future. Thus being said, online classes from home would definitely benefit and encourage many students do their work instead getting distracted and having side conversations.

Finally, students can benefit from doing online classes by having a better and more comfortable work environment. By having a better and more comfortable work environment for students, this can help them in many different ways. For example, students that do online courses at home work better and more efficient because they can have more help from a teacher in a comfortable environment that the student can enjoy. By doing this, students tend to learn the material faster and in a better environment.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes at home because they can go at their own pace, have no distractions, and work in a better and more comfortable work environment. By doing this, not only will students get many benefits from working at home, they will learn at their own pace. So the next time your students don't come to class, sign them up for online schooling.         ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B8E2173DE90F,"Distance learning has recently become a widely used feature of learning due to the technology advancements that make this possible. In the past decade, technology has advanced to make it possible for wide range online calls and even clear image video conferencing. School systems have taken advantage of this type of technology by allowing students to be able to take online classes or video call into a classroom. This option is available to practically any school student who owns a computer or smart device. Students should be able to utilize distance learning since it will be beneficial to them if they are able to attend classes from home because they can access it from anywhere which is helpful to students who don't live in safe or convenient environments and children who suffer from bullying who can complete their schooling in their home environment if they prefer.

Not all parts of the world are fully developed or safe enough for students to be able to go to school every single day and learn in a healthy setting. There are rough neighborhoods in New York, New Jersey, and many other states in America where kids have to worry more about surviving the day rather than getting to school. This is the instance in many other places around the world like Iran, certain places in North Africa, and others. In environments like those, children are more concerned about their personal safety which means they would rather stay home than risk going outside into their dangerous worlds. A recent statistics report published by the US Bureau of Statistics shows that those types of countries that are dangerous due to their government or any other circumstance have had fewer literacy rates over the past couple years. This means that over the past couple years, the amount of people in those countries that are able to read and write have dropped. This key piece of data supports the claim that students are not able to go to school because of their environments which results in lower literacy rates. With distance learning as an option, those students can learn from the safety of their home. They can complete online classes or video conferencing so that they do not have to go out into their dangerous worlds. Some countries aren't fully advanced or developed enough so there is no school close by to most students. In rural parts of India, for example, there is sometimes only one school per village so kids who live on the outskirts of the village would have to travel at least three miles by foot since they are probably not fortunate enough to afford a mode of transportation. This puts students in difficult situations, especially when there may be sweltering hot weather or freezing winds. So if they are able to access their schooling online, then they wouldn't have to go through that struggle. Instead, they just have to open a computer at home and save all the trouble and hassle of traveling to far schooling. Distance learning benefits students who live in dangerous areas or in undeveloped countries.

Some children voluntarily don't want to go to school because they are bullied due to a variety of reasons which may be a mental illness, their looks, the way they speak, or even the way they dress. Most kids who are bullied face the bullying by skipping school for an extended period of time and falling behind in all their classes. Once they start falling behind in their classes, they may feel like never wanting to catch up again. A survey written by a social scientist was sent to students from 6th grade to 12th grade regarding how they react to bullying if they have ever gotten bullied. Many of those respondents said that they first skipped 3-7 days of school because they couldn't handle being in an area with so many people while someone was making them feel bad. Other students like them would probably also skip some school days if they are feeling this way which would increase the amount of work they miss at school. A solution to this problem would be if the students are able to attend their classes from their home which is possible by online classes or video conferencing. This is greatly helpful to the students who don't feel comfortable in their school environment but still want to be able to learn and make sure they are not falling behind.

Opponents of distance learning may try to argue that in a home environment, students don't feel as motivated to learn so they will have limited learning abilities if they are not at school. But, every student has a different learning style and by forcing them to learn in a large environment with many students, learning may not be as helpful. Some students prefer individual learning and they are able to grasp knowledge better that way. Distance learning allows those students who have a different type of learning style to go to school in a way that would better benefit them. Online classes and video conferencing is just more options available to students; these options will be greatly appreciated by kids who want a different type of approach to the way they are taught. The school environment can be stressful or even harmful to some people if they have extreme social anxiety or they feel unsafe. Distance learning is a beneficial option to students who are able to take advantage of this opportunity and maximizing on their own style of learning.

Being able to attend classes from home is an amazing technology advancement that should be beneficial to students who live in unsafe or inconvenient environments and children who suffer from bullying due to a variety of reasons who can complete their schooling at home if they prefer. Distance learning can provide an education for many of those who are need of it or even for those who want to be more comfortable while they are learning. Whatever the reason may be, distance learning is beneficial to many students and being able to attend classes from home is a positive aspect of schooling which should be taken advantage of.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
D51B0DF8AEEA,"Guy Montag once said that books are a key to education and information after he realized their true meaning. These books represent the resources given to students by teachers to educate them indirectly. Some argue that home schooling is less effective than public schools, because students don't get the face to face lecture and interactive learning, and others think they don't. Students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, because they are given the resources such as books and develop initiative to complete all of their work.

Students that are home schooled are given all the learning material, but need to have the initiative to stay on top of their homework which they benefit from instead of having a teacher always reminding them. In

The Crucible by Arthur Miller,

John Proctor demonstrates initiative by owning up to the witch trials without the pressure of anyone else telling him so. This draws a connection to the students who are home schooled, because John Proctor and the students develop initiative to reach their goal. Students who have initiative will benefit even though they attend classes at home.

Students who are given the learning material such as books and online resources, get the same education as those who attend public schools. In

Farenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury,

Guy Montag refers to books as an example of education and allows him to truly find himself, and escape from the dysopian society. Guy Montag uses these books as a source of education to find his true meaning and proceed to a new society. These books represent the materials given to students who are home schooled.

Some argue that students who are home schooled don't get the same educational benefits as those who attend public schools, but this is not the case. Students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, because they are given the resources such as books and develop initiative to complete all of their work. But without these resources and initiative, students wouldn't benefit from attending schools at home.

869367F8A718,"Imagine not having to wake up earlier in order to shower, eat and put clothes on. Some schools have the convinient choice to let students study from home via online courses or through video. Some Students are fortunate enough to learn from their own home so, they wouldnt go through these minor set backs. Many students wish they were able to learn from home and not having to go to a public or private school. Students could also take courses that are nessesary for them and could help them with things that really are needed for the rest of their lives. For these students learning from home brings many benefits because, students would not worry about getting to school, they would still be able to learn whlile sick, and they would learn at a pace they needed to.

First, the students would'nt worry about how they were going to get to school. Students could relax a lot more knowing that they did not have to make those sacrifices to get to school. Having to make it on time to school adds an emense amount pressure to a student, because they know that their teacher would be angry for being late to their class, but when taking online courses they would be able to learn from home and not worry about making it on time. Being in a public school is all about timing becuase being late could have you getting lectures for hours on end and could get you introuble with your administrator, which is why when you learn from home you could do it any time through out your day because its an online course and its available at all times, when you also learn from home you're able to take your time on certain activities and such other tasks. Depending on the weather that could be even more time consuming, for example if its snowing you would have to warm your vehicle up in order to be able to drive it,and for people who walk to school they suffer the most because they have to either sweat or be so cold on the way to school and on the way back.

Second, students would'nt have to make it to school even when sick. Many schools suggest that students should stay home when sick in order to prevent the sickness from getting every other person in that building sick. When a student takes an online course, they could still learn from home without getting anyone else sick. Missing school could probably be one of the worst things, all because of the amount of work you would have to catch up on. Students that take the online courses are alot luckier because they are still able to learn from bed with any sort of sickness. Some students miss an important day like test days, but when they do they have to wait to take the test and get a zero in the grade book untill they complete the test on what ever make up day is assigned to them. When students who take online cources miss the test day they could complete it when ever, just because it's online and it won't have to be taken on hard copy .

Lastly, the student would be able to learn at he pace that they desire. Students who attend public schools know that they dont always move at the desirable pace because their are many others in there learning with them. For example when a student sits down in math class, the teacher is either really quick or the teacher is really slow. But when online you could have the teacher to please repeat themselves and move at the pace you would really like to. When a teacher has a class of twenty-plus kids she/ he really cant give you undevided attention because there are so many students in that class. For students who take the online classes they could have full attention of the teacher because every student has one specific teacher assigned to just for them, with this they are able to learn a lot more and are able to move from subject to subject alot quicker. The student who take the online class will also move at a much faster rate, because they wouldnt have any sort of distractions, but would give the teacher alot more attention than they would in a public class.

Some schools across the United States offer students the choice to take online courses from home. This helps many students that have problems getting to school and home, it allows students to learn at the pace they will be more successful at, and would help when a student is not feeling well enough to go to school. Many of the students wish they were able to take an online course, which is much better than an online school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
647A9F4B13E2,"Some schools offer distance learing as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video chating. Students may benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I agree, students should have the option to attend classes from home. Students will benefit from this but others may disagree with this idea. Students will benefit from being at home doing classwork than sitting in class all day listening to the teacher teach the lesson.

In Fact, Students in college may do their work or listen to the lesson online at home than to listen to the teacher talk. Students may even have the choice to do online college and still get their degree if they pass the class. Just like colleges, some schools offer online classes to students in high school. Students in high school may benefit from this to skip a grade and move to a higher grade or to get the credits they need. Students can benefit from online classes at home in many different ways.

Also, Students may take online classes instead of attending the classes at school because of life problem. For example, students may take online classes because the students may not have a car to drive theirselves to school. Students can benefit from learning lessons at home than at school. Students can also be ahead of their grade or class and score a higher grade in tests.

Some may say, students learning at school than taking online classes are the best idea for the student. Students can attend to class and understand the teacher; also students can ask for help face to face with the teacher to understand the lesson more. However, teachers may not have time to talk to different students with different problems all the time. Students taking online classes can send a message to the teacher or even video chat them to ask about the problem. Students taking online classes can also see how the lesson is shown on the screen than having the teacher explain it. Students can benefit from taking classes at home than attending classes at school.

Finally, Students can benefit from attending classes at home than at school. Students can score higher grades or move into a higher grade level. students can get the credits they need to pass a grade online than taking the class again in school. Students should do online classes than learnng the classes in school because it would benefit them in life. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F378D4CF4EC8,"Distance learning can provide many benefits to students and teachers. I feel, students should have the choice of deciding if distance learning or traditional learning is the right fit for them. Almost, every student will be eager to take their classes online. Not everyone will agree with my opinion, but here is why I strongly believe students should follow through with distance learning. By taking classes online, students will benefit by being given the choice to waking up when they desire. It will teach students better time management skills. As well as, being able to take their time on learning a new unit without feeling rushed. I think students will excel and benefit from attend school online rather than physically attending school

To begin, a benefit from attending class from home is, waking up whenever you desire. Students should have the choice to get out of bed when their body is well rested enough to start the day. For example, some schools start at 7:15 a. m. meaning, in order to have a well breakfast, time to get ready, and arrive at school on time, will expect the student to wake up even earlier to have time to complete their morning checklist. Once they arrive to school, they will not be physically and mentally prepared to fully function once the school day has started from the lack of energy they have. If students had the to choice to wake up when they are ready to wake up, they will have more energy to complete their assignments and get their work done. Some may say, if you allow the student to wake up whenever they desire, they will not complete their work and will put it off until they are behind in their academics. This is where time management comes in play.

Some believe, by allowing the student to decide how they want to manage their day will result in major issues in failing to complete their academic work. But on the contrary, by giving students the responsibility to complete their online assignments on time and by managing their own personal life, will give them the advantage to create a schedule that fits them the best. Not every student is the same. Every student carries busy and different lives, some include: sports, work, training and other extracurricular activities. It will teach students problem solving skills in determining how they should manage their own time. Once being able to balance out their schedule, students can not only use this skill for the present but for future purposes as well.

Lastly, distance learning will allow the student to move at their own paste. It will provide the student the ability to take their time on a certain subject that requires more time an attention for them to fully grasp the information they need to know. A personal example, I struggle in math class. As a class, we learn something new each class and from that, we build on from the prior class. If I didn't understand the material taught to us from the prior class, it will be hard to grasp the new material from the next class. Because of this, I struggle to comprehend the unit while also, being ready on time to take the exam with the rest of the class; even if I end up understanding the unit, I now fall behind on my other class work that needs to be done as well. It not only interferes with my set schedule but also my own extracurricular activities as well.

I believe, students will benefit from attending school online to provided for a well rested mind, improvement in time management skills, and also being able to understand the material at their own paste. Many students will excel and enjoy their high school experience with having the opportunity to take take their classes online. It will beyond beneficial to those students who carryout very busy lives and to those who rather just prefer to take their classes online. If all schools offered distance learning as an option for students to attend their classes online or video conferencing, I believe many students will excel in not only their academics but in their future life as well.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
6F3F3F42FA43,"Let's be honest school is or can be stressful for some students mainly because you have two or more classes to attend which can be a hassle especially if you have to be carrying books around all day. Not to mention the stress of having to take tests, finals, and dealing with homework, which also requires time limits that can cause more stress to the individual it can also make their anxiety level rise up, with that being said the anxiety and stress buildup would probably result in a mental breakdown that can result to serious medical conditions or possible mental health problems.

Nevertheless students would benefit a lot by attending classes from home, for example less stress and anxiety will weigh on them because they would be in the comfort of their homes with less noise that could potentially distract the individual, the students can also work at their own pace without rushing or fumbling around trying to beat their deadlines and it will also be cost efficient especially for the individuals who are attending college. They wouldn't need to stress or worry about paying student loans, debts, or need to require two or more jobs to receive enough money to pay for their classes it would also make the student more responsible and give them better time management skills by making sure they complete all there work and turn it in on time.

Furthermore, another way long distance schooling would be beneficial is the fact that a lot of students are shy or very quiet. Online schooling and video conferencing would provide more confidence and less secrecy when it comes to asking or answering a question, without the individual worrying about other students laughing at him or her or being silently judged, it will also boost self esteem and give a sense of accomplishment by being able to ask a question without feeling a sense of embarrassment or being mocked or shamed by other classmates it will also give the individual more confidence by asking more questions and require more help from his or her teacher that will help the student in the long run.

Therefore, long distance schooling would be beneficial because it will provide less stress to the students and make them feel more comfortable with there surroundings, it would also make the students more responsible and they would have better time management skills by making sure everything is finished, complete and turned in on time it will also help the students build self esteem and confidence that they will take and use with them along the way and it will help them become successful in life.  ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
BEDFC81C8E66,"Online classes are offered by some schools, but I they should be offered by all.

The benefit to students is undeniable and should be implemented on a larger scale. The tragic story of my childhood best friend, Generic_Name, proves that having the opportunity to take classes from home is a massive benefit to students through his depression, anxiety, and desire to succeed.

When I first met my soon to be best friend, Generic_Name, he was a shy but infectiously funny guy.

It amazed me how Generic_Name used to get through any tough situation life would throw at him with humor.

Given his personality, anyone would be hard pressed to label me a fool for being blind sighted by the changes he would go through.

He started to lose his love for life and comedy.

He started going out less and lost motivation to even get out of bed.

Generic_Name was diagnosed with clinical depression.

Before long he started missing school because of it. It started out as only once in a while, but gradually grew to become agonizingly frequent.

Generic_Name was missing more school than he could afford, and he soon went on to miss an entire semester.

For months, Generic_Name could not summon the strength nor the will to get out of bed in the morning.

He was put into a negative feedback loop in which the more school he missed, the worse he felt.

This would in turn make him miss more school and continute on this downward spiral.

His academic life was in ruins, but what got to him more than that was his social life.

Little would I have suspected, Generic_Name, concurrently with depression, suffered from extreme anxiety.

Social situations were in no respect his forte.

While this in itself is not too terribly terrific, it is not that abnormal.

What very few one knew was that his anxiety was made worse many times over by missing so much school.

It was obvious to him that if he went back, he would have to explain his absence and thus expose his depression.

The thought of all of his peers knowing about his depression exacerbated his anxiety and depression symptoms even further.

At this point, Generic_Name was in a ruined and defeated psychological state with no apparent light at the end of the tunnel.

However, his fierce desire to not fall behind me and his other classmates, graduate on time, and go to college would soon rout the depressed mindset that had occupied his mind for so long.

Generic_Name's deep seated, but dormant desire to succeed was awakened during the summer after his school year of half attendance.

He was on track to not be able move up to the next grade with all our peers.

This concept stoked the flames of perseverance and determination that would soon burn brightly.

He was approached by the school and was offered the opportunity to take the classes he needed to graduate from his grade online.

This was absolutely a perfect solution for all of Generic_Name's problems that were bogging him down.

Since he did not need to even get out of bed to take his classes, he was able to complete them without fail.

In addition to the feasibility of completing the classes, he wouldn't need to explain his absence to classmates while trying to focus on a lesson.

These two lifelines granted to him by the opportunity of online classes gave him exactly what he needed to get his life back on track.

The new year came and Generic_Name was in our grade, taking classes with us, and back to his old humorous self. It was truly a miracle.

Generic_Name told me years later how grateful he was for being granted the opportunity to take online classes.

Without them, he feels that he would be nothing in life and might not have even been alive at all.

Generic_Name was someone who was drowning in a sea of their depression, anxiety, and negative thoughts, but was thrown a life preserver in the form of online classes.

Generic_Name is not alone is his experience, and had not had the opportunity for online classes, who is to say what would have become of him.

Online classes directly benefit students who need them and can many times put their lives back on track.

The notion that online classes are not helpful to students is shortsighted and detrimental to students who need them the most like Generic_Name.

445A7391C15D,"Traditional schooling has always consisted of face to face learning with a teacher, tutor, or parent (if the individual is home schooled). However, as it becomes harder for students to travel and fit into schools with limited capacities, it is becoming near impossible to satisfy the educational needs of all children in the U.S. This is where video conference based learning comes in hand. While this system does eliminate the geographical issues within public education, it brings up more concerning issues like how these ""at home"" students would take tests, how focused they would be, and how they would attend extra curricular activities.

Online learning can make it more practical for a student to connect with teachers without the hassle of driving someplace or losing school days due to weather. Currently, the winter seasons are difficult for teachers in Virginia due to unpredictable snow and ice days taking away school for the day. Even though these teachers are still able to assign homework to some degree, it becomes much harder for them to actually teach their students and stay on track with their material. While there can still be issues with electronic teaching during huge weather storms which take out the power supply to neighborhoods, it still reduces the impact of severe weather by keeping students off the roads and the teaching staff safe at home. Even if the teachers don't have their materials to teach labs or demonstrations located at their house, they can at least contact the students and hopefully work on a review day for a big test coming up or give the students notes from a couple classes ahead in the schedule so that they don't miss out on valuable class time. Additionally, eliminating the steps between waking up and getting to school makes it much less likely that students will come late to school. In fact, it can even save them some sleep by allowing them to simply wake up and go to school right in their living room. This not only helps students stay more awake, but can also insure that students are not tardy due to heavy traffic, a late bus, or simply forgetting something at home. Therefore, it is very useful to have online teaching in the sense that weather has a smaller chance of affecting teachers schedules and can limit the hassle of driving from one's home to their school.

On the contrary, online education is very hard to monitor seeing as students are able to hide their actions better and have a higher probability of getting away with cheating. While plagiarism is still hard to pull off with modern day tools such as Turnitin. com and other work checking sources, it is likely that some students will easily be able to copy their friends work and turn it in, making only minor changes to trick the teacher. In fact, the limited view of the computer monitor would make it almost enticing for a student to hide the answer key behind the computer and glance at it every couple of seconds or simply hang it above the computer. While this issue can be fixed by issuing students computers with a 360 degree field of vision, this would border on intruding into the student's personal life and raise other issues. Even though students cannot look at other students papers over their shoulder while they test, this is only one issue of cheating fixed which consequently leads to dozens of others being created. Thus, online education will only make it easier for students to cheat on assessments.

Similarly, having online education address a student in their home or place of comfort only increases the amount of distractions present to them. For example, a student could easily stop paying attention to focus on other classes, toys, games, TV, food, friends, family, and more. It is even feasible that the students will get distracted looking out the window of their house if whatever is in their yard is more intriguing than that which is being taught to them. This is the primary reason why online education will never work. Even if the student tries their best to isolate themselves in a room void of all distractions, it is incredibly easy to fall asleep since the student does not have to fear the teachers scolding and repercussions in real life. Similar to how cyber bullying is easier to start than real life bullying, it is easier to hide behind a screen and hear your teacher yell at you for falling asleep compared to having to put up with it in real life. Finally, staring at a screen for a long period of time is never healthy for students. It not only deforms their spine (if improper stature is used) but can destroy their eyesight slowly. Conversely, if a student were to meet with a teacher in real life and have to pay attention to them all day instead of a computer screen, they would not only be more engaged but also not get headaches and eye pain from staring at the obnoxious glow of a computer screen all day.

Finally, bring school back home and never leaving the house makes it much harder to participate in extra curricular activities. Since most activities students participate in are heavily tied with public schools, it would become harder to make it to sports practices, clubs, honor society meetings, and more. Without these extra curriculars, students have a higher chance of becoming bored, indignant, and inactive in society. This also makes it harder to connect with students online seeing as many students know certain teachers through coaching a sports team or supporting a club. Without these connections, teachers simply become another face on the screen telling the students what to do. Therefore, online education is not only a bad idea due to distractions, but also limits students' ability to be active and engaged in class.

In conclusion, online education can offer certain benefits and eliminate small issues in the education system. However, it would be more detrimental to students by allowing them to cheat, quickly become distracted, and miss out on extra curricular activities.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
EA5BFD706570,"The topic of online learning is very controversial. Many schools offer online services to accommodate those who vary in schedules, need more time for assignments and comprehension, or even those who just work better alone. Now a days, schools are becoming more diverse in terms of the variation in which a student can learn. There are both current benefits and future benefits to online learning. Although some people think students have no benefits from online learning, it should be known that students do in fact benefit from online learning.

There are several ways students can benefit from online education currently. One benefit being that it gives students the chance to work at their own pace and not feel pressured to keep up with the rest of the class. This would've needed to be done, had learning been set in a classroom setting. For example, a student may not understand a concept in math and want to try and fully understand the concept before being tested on it. In schools currently, many students are being forced to take tests having not have comprehended the topic of study. This also leads to the problem of social influence on a students learning. As humans, we tend to conform to the rest of society and value deeply what society has to say about us. Students self-esteem and self-efficacy go down when they don't understand a topic. Students tend to not want to be the outcast when it comes to not understanding a topic, so they just go ahead with a test, which results in them doing poorly on because not enough time was given to them. Online school provides this option, so a student is not given a test before they thoroughly understand the concept. This also pertains to the flexibility of a student's schedule. Some students may switch to online learning due to sports and can't afford to be continuously missing school. For example, my friend Kady does gymnastics with me, and gymnastics meets happen almost every weekend. Online school is a great way for her to do school work on her own time, because work gets done depending on when she is available, aside from doing meets. There's less stress about having to do homework for the next day. This leads me into another benefit to online learning. Another benefit to online learning would be that it is a potential stress reliever or minimizes stress. Many students may feel better and be less stressed doing homework or school work, because of being in the comfort of their own home or in a space that is safe for them. Students feel free to take breaks and not be restricted to the overcrowded rooms that are common in regular schools. It's also proven that surroundings have an effect on mood and willingness to learn. If the atmosphere of a classroom is sad, depressing, or gloomy, then students may have a gloomy or depressing attitude when in that class, hindering them from learning at their fullest potentials. With online schools, the student chooses their place of study and knows what places motivate them to create high quality work and retain the most information.

There are also ways students can benefit from online education in the future. One benefit is that the student will be more independent. When doing online school, the student doesn't have access to a tangible teacher or access to a teacher 24/7. Sometimes students will have to wait for a teacher, if the teacher works for both online and public schools, to answer a question that the student has on a problem or concept. Sometimes students will have to figure out the concept themselves which develops their problem-solving skills. The independence and problem-solving skills can become useful later on when the student applies for a job. Many employers like employees who don't depend on the employer for everything but can try and solve problems on their own first. For example, when working at a McDonalds drive-thru with a line full of people, the employee doesn't have time to be asking the employer a series of questions if a problem occurs. Instead, the employee must find quick solutions and learn independence. The employee won't learn unless they try it. Another benefit to online education is the student learns time management and responsibility. Although online education is flexible, school work still needs to be completed in a timely manner and it is the students responsibility to get it done, for there is no one around to set verbal due dates. Students still need to write papers in online school, but the only difference is there is no teacher to remind you of the due date and pressure you to complete it. Later in life, those online students are very aware of due dates and deadlines,for they have been accustomed to following them throughout their high school careers. Employers like employees who are punctual and have tasks or assignments done on time. This idea of time management also prepares the student for college if they choose to go to an actual college or university. Professors like assignments done on time and also won't give too many frequent reminders on when those assignments are due. Professors also like when students take accountability for their actions. It's not the teachers fault if work is not completed on time or is lost. The blame is solely put on the student.

Online schooling truly depends on the person at hand. What works for one person doesn't always work for another. Online school promotes both current and future benefits, as does public schools. There is no say in which one is better or worse. As individuals we are all different and possess different traits and qualities. With so many individuals in the world, it's important that we accommodate all people. A person may strive in one situation but stress in another. This means that online schooling should remain an option for students and families.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5DB4FE5D6A00,"Many parents recommend their child to be in home school than in public school. Scientist have proven that students do better home school than anywhere else. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it helps them focus and learn better.

Students have so many distractions in public school where it makes them hard to focus on their school work. Bullying is a main distraction that makes students unable to focus in school. If students are being joked and pushed around in school, they are not going to focus on their work. Also, when teachers are teaching a lesson or if someone is already out to use the restroom, student are unable to go until that person is done. If students were home schooled, they could go to the restroom whenever they want. Furthermore, another distraction to students is when they are hungry. It is bad enough that schools give students a minimum of food every day. Most students are still hungry after lunch, because it was not enough food. Food keeps everyone's brain cells motivating. Therefore, in homeschooling, students can eat whenever they want to stay focused.

While some people think students would not benefit from being home schooled in fact, students learn better. Sometimes, it is hard to understand someone else if they came from a different state or country because they have an accent. It is difficult to learn something if they can't understand what the person is saying. In other cases, the student could speak a different language, while the teacher can't understand what the student is saying. It is hard to communicate with someone when one person can't understand the other. Additionally, some teachers move to fast where the student can't comprehend what the teacher said. If students where home schooled, they could move at their own paste, go over the same subject as many times as they need to, and could find different ways to learn something.

In Conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home. Homeschooling is less stressful that any other type of school because students can go at their own paste without worrying about getting left behind. There would be no distractions, bullying, or struggling to understand what the teacher is saying if students were home schooled. Students would be happier in homeschooling and would benefit from it all!",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
DC5BDFA3BFD6,"In life, we are expected to learn. We learn how the world works, how to do things, and learn from the mistakes we make along the way. Now, it is only fair to say that everyone has a different and unique way of learning, whether it be through hands on activities, trial and error, or just being told what to do. The demand for these needs is high due to the rising population in public schools, and not every student's needs can be met at all times. Some of the students may struggle based on how the curriculum is taught in one class, and excel in another one taught differently. It all depends on how each student receives information the best. Certain educational centers provide distance learning, which provides students with the opportunity to complete their studies and courses online. The courses offer students the chance to have video conferences, independent learning, and many more things that are made for the single purpose of ensuring education. As technology advances, this programming should be required for school systems to partake in and offer to their students who would like to take their education by the horns and steer it in the right direction.

Throughout the school day, everyone has that one class they absolutely hate. They walk into the room and it's like a minute turns from 60 to 1,000 seconds and they are stuck there forever. In this time, nothing gets done and the same amount gets learned. This class consists of about half who actually care about what the subject is, and the other half who can't seem to control themselves enough to not act out in spite of not caring. The half of the students who actually pay attention are stuck with a teacher who has to repeat themselves a thousand times a class period when they should be on another chapter by now. This not only frustrates the teacher and the students, but it creates negative air between the students and the teacher. I mean, who wouldn't hate a teacher that talks about the mitochondria a BILLION times a day? In this situation, some perks of distance learning are shown. The students who show passion to learn can be offered one-on-one time with the instructor through video conferencing, which will not only help the faster paced learners, but take away some of the tension in the classroom. Time with a teacher face to face on your own creates comfort and trust built into the instructor-student relationship, promoting better learning.

One of the morals that childhood has taught us is that ""slow and steady always wins the race"". This moral is not only unethical, but it shows how unaware we really are. Everyone works at their own pace; some faster and some slower. It's not that the slower paced students are unintelligent or not as bright as the others, it's just their way of producing whatever work they are learning. Through distance learning, students don't have to feel pressured to work as fast as other peers and can learn on their own time. It also gives students a sense of responsibility and makes them come to terms with reality in a way. This way, they don't have someone constantly spoon-feeding them deadlines and due dates, but they have to remember them on their own. Learning how to budget time is a very important skill that is taught this way, and it is helpful preparation for college.

Some people have a rougher time in college than others and are scared to commit due to outside sources. Say you are a 20 year old woman in her sophomore year of college, working a tiring job on the night shift, and struggling to pay rent due to classes. You manage to slide by in your courses, trying to get the best out of your work, but you can't help but be late to most classes due to oversleep and exhaustion. Luckily, there are specific colleges that provide classes that can be scheduled around your late nights, and shifts. These colleges are technology-based and provide classes for whenever you need to or are able to come in. They respect your employment, and encourage your scheduling as long as you turn in work on time, meet deadlines, and come in to a class period whenever you can. This system of distanced learning provides people a head start on life and their career all at once.

It is true to say that most of us would prefer a quiet and independent environment over a loud and busy one any day. Loud noise and stimulation do not mix, in fact, it only causes more distraction. Though this may be, some kids do prefer social learning environments rather than the quiet. These learning environments surround students by other peers and encourage debates, understandings, and protests. The benefits may seem negative, but in these events students start to bounce ideas off of each other and grow in thought processing. Students will attract those who agree with their views and form bonds, creating comfort in the classroom for them. It is easy to feel alone when you don't understand a topic, but it can be valuable to have that other person there in the class who doesn't quite get the same problem you don't. You can collaborate, put together what you both know, and come up with a solution. this not only provides for better learning, but provides children with the social skills they will need for life.

The goal of distance learning is solely to bring out the best learning capability of students. It is provided so that students of different learning paces can have different method options as to which best fits their area of learning. There is something for everyone, whether it be independent teachings, one-on-one time with teachers, or staying in the classroom. Everyone should have the opportunity to test out distance learning and see whether it is the optimal choice for them or not. We all learn at different paces, but it is important to let ourselves grow on different paths than we thought we would. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
87301169FEAA,"In the 21st century humanity has entered what has come to be known as the Digital Age. Through advancements in computer technology and communication in general, the world has become more connected than ever. One area in which improved communication has been seen is in education. Some schools have begun offering distance options for students to attend, ranging from online courses to video conferencing. Although some may disagree, these long distance options are not only a positive, but, must be expanded further.

The first major benefit of distance learning is more inclusively. There are many reasons different groups of students may not be able to get the education they need face to face. For instance, students with certain disabilities may not be able to attend school. There may also be an absence of schools within reach that can properly help with their disabilities; Therefore, it would be highly beneficial to allow these students a means by which they may get their education, even if they can not physically attend class. In a similar vein, there are many students who may not have physical access to schools that work for them. These students may be unable to truly get the education they need; However, with a more interconnected world students who are physically unable to may finally gain access to courses and learning styles that truly allow them to gain the education they need, and pursue their career. A group of students that is in a less dire situation, but would still benefit are people who may be absent for one reason or another. A sick day at the wrong time may severely impact a student's grades, but may be necessary for the well being of themselves and others. By allowing temporary in-home access to school for absent students the penalty for taking the rest they need is far less.

Another way in which offering long distance means of education would help is by expanding education as a field. For the most part, in terms of public education, what can be done is mostly limited and far too similar; However, with the advent of long distance education far more ways of learning could be introduced for students and teachers alike. One way this could be seen is expanding the reach of schools and educational facilities as a whole. Through improved communication more schools could reach a greater number of students, helping each student find a style of learning uniquely suited for them and their needs. This could also allow teachers a greater reach, helping them find the best students and teach to the best of their abilities. Through this process both teachers and students will optimize their abilities to teach and learn respectively. Most importantly, distance learning would provide new opportunities for the field of education to expand. Having to engage with distance learning would create new obstacles; However, this adversity would provide situations in which the means of education occurs, and would force them to expand. Just as diamonds are created through immense pressure, so to would new challenges force schools to become even greater.

In Conclusion, recent major improvements to communication provided by the digital age would have a massive positive impact on the way in which learning is done, especially for those who can not attend school physically. Distance learning provides both a means by which the less fortunate can still receive the luxury of education and allows schools, teachers, and students to see improvements to the ways in which education as a process occurs. Some may argue that increased use of distance learning would promote absentees and hinder students abilities to learn, but innovation and inclusion are always goals to be pursued. Distance learning provides an opportunity for all students and teachers to connect and better themselves, which is a goal that must be pursued.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
41811B5B8FDB,"Growing up in today's society, it is known that public schooling is the main source of education. Children are introduced to pre-school at a young age to gradually familiarize them with their surroundings and the outside world. Although it is not an issue being talked about, some kids are not given that opportunity to attend school at a certain age, or they are not given the opportunity to attend school at all. There are solutions to that conflict, such as introducing them to kindergarten or first grade instead of starting with pre-school and day care, or having an at-home teacher for home schooling. In most cases, especially in high school, teens are given the option to take online classes that benefit them as much as attending class in school would.

Enrolling in an online class or completely committing to online school is not that different from waking up at 6 a. m. every morning and catching a bus. Being able to take a class online offers one the chance to choose what classes to take and when they want to attend them. For example, Generic_School offers mainly sophomores the oppportunity to take health and physical education over the summer, instead of taking it during the following school year. That way, any sophomore who chooses to take that class over the summer would be able to choose another subject that is in their field of interest or even a class that is beneficial to their future career. The downside of that could be often be a fee, of course, considering that it is a class taking place over the summer while everyone else is enjoying their time with friends and family; however, not all online classes would have to be paid for.

At Generic_School, not only do students have the ability to take classes online over the summer, but students are able to attend classes online during the school year as well. A well-known community college in Generic_City is the Generic_School, which offers online classes to seniors who plan on taking dual enrollment, advanced placement, or even honors. Dual enrollment and advanced placement is important because it gives the student college credit for their classes in college. It is common for upperclassmen to take on that given opportunity and enroll in a class online during the school year, which not only gives them the choice to choose what class they want to attend, but when they want to attend it. For a morning person, one would prefer their class to take place at sunrise, and if one is a night-owl, they would then prefer to take their classes during the evening. In conclusion, it gives students more freedom to expand their interests.

It is understandable that online classes and or schooling can be hard on students, especially if it starts at a young age. Most families would prefer their kid(s) to take on the world with public schooling, but others would rather keep them sheltered if they believe home schooling is a better form of introducing education; nevertheless, it is still education at the end of the day. Any form of education is helpful to society, whether it be online, in school, with a tutor, or family members. Everyone is constantly learning new things everyday, and technology is advancing as the seconds go by. It is all based on preference and what is comfortable with an individual if they want to be a part of an online class or not.

Online schooling and classes can be beneficial because not only does it give students a chance to balance better time management, but it could improve better education purposes with college credits, meeting new people, form new friendships from different schools, and is an overall wonderful experience.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D1A866170CEA,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? There is a debate if students would benefit or not from online classes? Some people believe that students would do better if their classes are at home. I believe that you can learn more if you are in a regular class than just being at home because students can learn from other cultures or more things about life with other friends, if students do not interact with others in a future they are going to be afraid to do it, and finally if you are in a regular school you can do more activities and share with your friends.

First, when you are in a school of the united states you learn a lot from other cultures. Therefore besides than world geography, you learn from your friends countries and how is to live there. Also, when you have friends at school you share your problems and most of the time you learn more things about life with them and how you can be a better person.

Second, sometimes there can be shy people at school because they do not know how to interact with others or how to start a conversation. When you do activities in groups sometimes you make new friends and talk to others became easily than before. However, if students do not learn how to talk to others in public places they are going to be afraid in a future; imagine if they need to make a presentation at work, they are not going to be able to do it because they will be afraid to talk in front of all the co-workers. Learn how to interact with others is important for your future.

Third, it is important to get involve in activities at school; activities help you with your curriculum when you apply to college. Also, if you are in any activity you can share more with your friends. However, when you get involved with activities at school helps you to clear your mind when you have to many homework or when you are stress out about your classes. Therefore, some of the activities give a lot of skills in the thing that you would like to do in your future.

In conclusion, if students do not interact with others or neither have a friend to talk with, and they do not have activities to get involved with other people; students are not going to be successful if they try in a future to interact with a large group of people. Therefore, it is very important to learn from others and interact at your school. That is why I believe that everybody should take classes on a regular school, to learn how to get involved with others and be able to express your self.   ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
97CEC5F124E5,"The matter of schools offering online education from home is a widely controversial topic. There are many pros and cons to each option that parents and students may overlook. The difference between distance schooling and on site schooling could change one's future in many ways. Although some may believe it is more beneficial to take online courses from home, on site schooling helps students to develop better social skills and understand material more efficiently than from home all to help develop life skills that cannot be achieved online.

Throughout life, social skills become a big part of the way one operates in reality. Some may say distance classes will help to shield students from factors such as bullying and danger, but they can also take away from the many joys of school such as sports, clubs, and other activities. A student who participates in sports and clubs learns cooperative skills that can be useful in many careers ,where as one who does not may not be such a team player. By preventing students from experiencing these social factors it harms the way they may approach society. Without social skills, kids may become more shy and introverted rather than being more witty and outgoing. For example, a kid who attends a school dance and is apart of clubs or a sports team may become more social than one who stays at home doing nothing. Social skills help to shape ones character and taking that away would not be beneficial to these students or society.

As well as social skills, work efficiency is another big part of the world today. Many may argue that a classroom environment is stressful to students who may learn at a slower pace than others. By taking away personal face to face instruction, it could be seen as eliminating a stress factor in schooling, however, having teachers and peers surrounding each other helps students to push themselves to become better workers. One time I had to stay home from school because I was sick and when I was doing my homework I had questions that I had no one to ask. At home one cannot ask questions or get hands on help from a teacher or other student. Having the help you need in a school environment helps students to become better educated and understanding.

These skills help a person to develop character and personality. One's character can reflect who they will be in the world and what they may do. Life has many obstacles in it but through learning different tools and skills in a classroom life can be effortless. There are milestones that help students to find who they are such as graduating elementary school, taking classes on arts and sciences, team sports and many more. People learn from themselves and others mistakes. Distance schooling keeps kids away from these opportunities to live and learn. On site schooling helps students to develop the knowledge they need to live in the world.

These factors and many more help students to become team players in the world. On site schooling gives students life lessons that can't be taught behind a computer. Along with these lessons are life long memories that give a person character that you can't get behind a computer. Classroom learning is more beneficial to students than distance schooling. Online schooling may seem more efficient to some but learning in a classroom helps to develop well rounded students with good life skills.              ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DF00A9FDE3D9,"Distance learning can have a different affect on each individual. Students that work well alone would benefit from this but students that do better in a classroom setting would not. This option would take a lot of self control because if you are not doing the work it would hurt you instead of help you. This choice could also be easier because it would also be more one on one or more personal and some students need exactly that to be succesful. Distance learning could also not benefit you because some students wold not take it serously and cheat their way through the year.

Schools offering distance learning made a good choice by doing this because they're giving students with diferent circumstances to have options in learning. There are so many different reasons why students could want this option , if I had the choice I would take it. I say this because being in a classroom having to sit still for over an hour is not for me and spending 8 hours in a place I don't want to be is even worse. Dealing with teachers is also a reason why distance learning could be better because not all teachers want the best for you and that can really make school harder. Attendance also comes into play because a lot of students have attendance problems especially as you go up in grades but with distance learning for an option there is no reason to worry about attendance.

All schools should offer distance learning because some students may really need it and if they have it all students should be informed about it. Learning is a different exprience for everyone so if distance learning benefits you , go for it. Everyone should have an option of how they want to learn because only you know what is best for yourself. Schools should always want what is best for their students so if this is for them help them make this right choice. In conclusion I think distance learning does benefit the right students and could be very useful in their lifes. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
A9E9851F3E7E,"Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some parents think it is a good idea for students to stay at home for education. Students should not attend classes from home. Here are the three reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

The first reason is students are just wasting time at home doing work, but they are really just playing video games or watching T.V. Also Most of the students that are home schooled can easily get distracted from Cellular devices too. What if the students have siblings, they might not have the time to do there work on time. Students at home may not have any connection. So, students will not be able to do any homework.

The second reason is students can struggle with homework. Students can focus on doing there homework or class work. But what if students are blind and can not do any work at home. If a student is blind, parents would have to hire or contact someone to help that blind student at home for some help. A student from a different country may not speak English. That also can be a struggle for a parent or gaurdian because they might not be able to afford classes at home.

The third reason is wasting money on books or classes. Most states have classes for free books or classes, but some other states might not. Parents might have not have the money for the classes or for the books. But wasting money on classes or books is not a good idea. Parents have to pay bills but what if the student needs the money for the classes.

Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home or by video conferencing. Parents may think it is a good idea for students to stay home for education at home. Students should never attend distance learning for there education.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5419620CA869,"Many people have the debate on if students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Being able to attend classes from home can cause a lack of things needed for the outside world but can also give students an opportunity to learn in ways they can't at school. Attending classes at school can be distracting and not a great workplace for some students but can also open students to be more socializing and prepare them for the future. Both of these situations has reasons that are positive and negative. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can get more rest, move at their own pace, and can focus better.

Students should be eligible to attend classes from home because they can get more rest. Students get up as early as 6 a. m. to make it to school in time, which deducts the time of sleeping and can cause your thinking to slow down. For example, Generic_School bell rings at 8:20 a. m., but students catch the bus around 7:30 a. m., meaning they will have to wake up earlier to make it. Not getting enough sleep can cause students to fall asleep in class. If that occurs, it can cause missing instruction time and affect final grades. Getting the right amount of sleep also affects your health. If students were able to take classes at home they could possibly complete it in the afternoon and have more time to rest in the morning. Getting the correct amount of sleep is one of the most important factors in order to be able to function through out the day.

If students could attend classes from home they could complete work at their own pace. Most assignments are to be completed in a class block, some students can't move that fast. Sometimes students turn in incomplete work because it had to be done within a short period of time and they end up with a bad grade. Everybody prefers a different way of learning or getting things done. With that being said, working at your own pace can help you discover your way of working. A lot of pressure can be put on students because they are being rushed to complete work. For example, my english teacher assigns more than one assignment at a time and they were due in the same day and if they weren't complete they would be automatic zeros, that caused us to hurry and complete the work before the block was over. Being able to work at your own pace can affect you positively in many ways.

Some people may argue that students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Not going to school can decrease your chance of adjusting to the public. If students are at home all day, they wont be used to being around strangers and you will have to get used to that in order to survive in the world. Going to school can also increase your social skills. In life your going to have to socialize a lot, without having those skills it may be hard for you to be successful. On the other hand, in school you dont really get a choice of where you can complete your work, and the class you're in can be distracting. So, taking classes at home can be an better environment for you to focus.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can get more rest, move at their own pace, and can focus better. Working at home can benefit you personally much more than working at school. Although their may be negative ways that it doesn't benefit you, it still is a good idea because of how many positive ways.

04D4F9F350F6,"Have you ever take classes online? Here is my opinion about it: I do not think that students get benefit by studying in this way, because is not the same as if the student go to school, because in online classes there is no teacher to explain you clearly how to do the work that you are studying.

For example: I'm taking one class online and is not the same as if I take it in my school, because like I said there's no teacher to explain it to me how to do it. Also, I have some friends and they are taking classes online either and they say that it's a little bit difficult for them understand those classes, because there is no one to teach them how to do what they have to do. They have to figure it out (teach themselves)

how to do their works. This could be a disadvantage because people who go to school could know more things that you know because of that.

Some people unfortunate have to take this classes because they have some obstacles. Maybe they work, they missed that class in the past, or they just want to take it online. Online classes use to be easier than regular classes that's why some people take them. I did not take because of that. I take it because I missed that classes. Take regular classes will always be the best way to learn a lot about some subject, because you will have your teacher explaining to you how to do some things and stuff. Classes online will always be a good option but not as much as regular classes are. People always say that classes online are good, but that they do not feel that learn enough.

In conclusion classes online could be good,but not that good. Is a good option for people who work during the day and they can take them during the night or conversely.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
370E7C2794AB,"Everyone has different perspective learning online. Thinking about it's like home schooling, and maybe there some good things about it. And believe it or not their some bad things about it as well. they are asking me show my point of view is little difficult because I have seen both sides how it's like to be doing school online or home schooling. That is why I am going put both aspects in this prompt, so I can let reader decide what point of view they want to choose.

Comparing home schooling with online school is pretty simple if think about it. online schooling is mostly on computers or new technology today. knowing this some people like doing old fashion way, like with pen and paper. Seeing that having typing instead of writing is easier for some, but not all. Having multiply ways of doing things can help us all around. Not everyone can agree on doing the same thing at once. Now home schooling is little different because it use any type of ways teaching kids. Both have one major factor, is that the kids should take there time on doing work and learning.

The reason that people do online schooling is because they live in another country, or their career is taking a lot of time and can't get to the schooling in person. Some people maybe didn't finish school and redo some of their classes to pass. And having the ability to get second chance on finishing school is a blessing to most people. The people living in another country is very hard, they might a good living situation and struggle get the chance to get school there. Just maybe the only way to do school is online, or having teachers from another country, to tech you from online.

Some of positives and negatives of online schooling or home schooling is very easy to explain, but not easy to you should start first. So I am going start with positives first, you get to lay back at home for most of the time. And makes your schedule more flexible when have go some were. The negatives are don't have a lot for social time, because don't really have people around your age talk too. Not just that people like me become more introverts instead of being extroverts. Like me I was home school once and did not go well, reason was I argue with the teacher; also know as my mom. That is reason I am back in public school, and it's not so bad being in public school. One more thing, online schooling might be easier, but don't forget that you might get everything is provide or maybe you will.

Knowing this information choose what you think on this prompt. Seeing that online or home schooling are very different, or are very similar. And to remember all the possible solutions when doing anything with online schooling because most people just jump right in without thinking.

so try talking to people before head right in, so you can get a perspective on how it might work. Wonder if you are ready to do online schooling, but if not well then only thing I can do is provide you with this essay. Last, is don't forget it your choice what you get from this. Don't let someone choose for you.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
5945ADE75E5E,"What can schools do to better their students educational experience? There has been many discussions on how teachers and educators can reach out to their students and make the learning experince more accessible. Some schools have taken the approach for online schooling so the student can work at home while still doing their work and classes. I think students can benefit from doing online school because it lets them work in a more pleasant environment and can get rid of some of the distractions that come from other classmates.

Students can benefit from doing their work at home from being in a more comfterable environment. Being in a school setting can make students stressful from all the other classmates judgment. Classes are filled with up with many different types of people and some don't always understand the material as well as the rest. This can lead to insecurities and fearfulness of being judge by others, and this can also lead to less focus on the subject and more of what others think of you. Students will also feel more comfterable from working at their house because it is where most people go when they want to get away and relax. A persons home has everything you own and you know it very well, which makes it a place of comfort. Working at home is a positive way to get away from the judgment of others and also be in ones safe space for accomplishing tasks.

A regular school classroom can have a lot of distractions in them. Trying to get work done in a classroom can be changing at times from the other peers. There is also a cliche class clown that likes to crack jokes but can drive the attention away from what people should really be doing at the moment. People like this can change the whole mood of the room and the rest of the class can just lose motivation of working on the assignment. If students were able to do school online though , there would be none of that because they would just be at home doing the assignments with no one else. Some Classrooms can also have a room full of close friends making it hard to not talk or get off task. While the teacher can try and separate the group of close friends there can still be interaction and even more distraction for the rest of the class. Students can have more focus for doing online school from being able to get away from distracting classmates.

Parents or older relative can disagree on this issue from wanting the students to have a classic education. The thought of having more students work and take their classes at home can seem daunting to older relatives from the thought that they weren't given that option at their age or that the educational system just shouldn't change at all. The reality is that as time goes on things ,such as schools, are going to evolve for the better and without change things won't grow and lead to more success. The idea that schooling will be on someones computer could seem like an out of this world plan but if it will better the students education and mental health then they should be open to the change.

Online schooling will benefit a students from being a safe environment to work and having less distractions from their classmates. A persons house is an area where we don't feel judge and can fully relax. Working in a classroom can lead to class clowns and close friends driving attention away from the task at hand. With all of the new found technology we are able to do this and if it is going to improve the educational system then it should be given to the students who truly need it. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0214F87B86C3,"Image if you live 10 miles away from your school, and you are in a traffic in your way to school, the class that you need to take is important to you, because that class will allow you graduate. There is a debate about if students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home by online classes or video conferencing. Some people believe that if students attend classes from home that would not benefit them. I believe that if students attend classes from home that would benefit them because students can have the chance to learn the class better, some students live far away from school and some students have to work to cover their responsibilities.

One reason is that students can have the chance to learn the class better. If students do not understand the class the first time, they can review the class the times that they want. Some times students needs an extra explanation about the class, but the teachers are not there to explain. By taking online classes or video conferencing, students can have the opportunity to resolve their problems about their classes.

Another reason is that some students live far away from school and some times they can not attend school. Many students who live away from school, they need to drive to be at school, but some times the traffic could be an obstacle for those students. Some time they can not come to school. But by taking online classes can help them, to stay at the same level, that others students who attend class are.

Finally, some students have to work to cover their responsibilities. Many students are independent and they need to work for pay pay their expenses and needs. Some times they do not have time to attend classes at school. But some students after they finish their woks, they use the rest of the time by taking online classes, so with this they can go to work and then study by themselves. That can help them improve their education and also work at the same time.

In conclusion, I believe that if students attend classes from home, that would benefit them because students can have the chance to learn the class better, some students live far away from school and some students have to work to cover their responsibilities. So schools should offer distance learning as an option for those students who work, live away from school and for those who wants to be better in class and improve their knowledge.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
3B50C316E9CA,"Some schools have programs where you can take classes from the luxury of your own home. It would either be online or in a video conference. Having a way to learn without being there is conveint for most people. Some students have a hard time making it or coming to school because,they may have a disability, having problems with their peers, or they can be drained physically and mentally.

First,disabilities are already hard enough to deal with but, having to wake up early to get ready and try to catch the bus on time is a struggle. A girl that went to my school was in a wheelchair, she had to take the bus in the morning and get picked up in the afternoon. One day she said, it was hard for her to get up every morning because she could not move from the waist down. Her parents had to get off from work because they had to pick her up from school each day. Most students have learning disabilities like ""ASD"" and need special attention.

Second,problems with your peers or teachers is one of the biggest issues when students don't show up or come in late. Some people may argue that coming across conflict with people helps students get ready for the real world. Even though that maybe right most students don't care. Most students if they are having complications they won't show up because it will continue. Students end up with depression or anxiety.

Lastly,students have jobs and other things to do in their time. They don't have time to keep up with the class. Balancing schoolwork,homework,a job,and family and friends can be a lot for one person. people that are in the military can be and class and work at the same time so they need to take an online class which would be more convient for them. Highschoolers that have a job find it hard to balance their time but, taking a class online will make it easier for them

In conclusion, it would be beneficial to have online classes in general. Having a way to learn without being is school is really helpful for some students. Students with a disability can have extra help. Most colleges are online anyways so, this can help you prepare for college. For students with problems with their teachers or peers can swicth to an online class.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5CB049559D6C,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Why is attending an in school courses a beneficial way ? Learning from school helps a student to be more beneficial because, it helps a person be more fast with their work because they know there is a dead line .And learning in school helps work in a destructive area or environment and help you learn how to be more focused. But attending classes from home by online is a convenient way for others because it's less stressful and help with the focus and with less destruction or disturbances, it helps finish more work than an in school attender. Benefits now would be that a student attending in school would know time management and can learn the ability to work through distractions or any disturbances. Although students at home taking online classes would probably be more dependent and have better grades,it should be known that every student or kid should have the accessibility to a social and an interactive life and some skill that needs to be picked up by a person or student and the responsibilities of growing up.

And a way to interact with other as in social skills. Benefits later would be an a student attending online classes can be ahead of students in school and start an early career but would lack the ability for social skills and also an online class taker would be more dependent on their self.

Students who go to in school to take classes are more experienced because they've had the guidance of most teachers and counselors to help them get through the hardship and with all the problems that students go through also even though students who take courses online at home might get a head start at a career they might probably lack the skill of advice and the knowledge that an in school student might have. Because a student in school might have learnt that in careers you need to be social on time and even maybe work overtime or even work ahead of time to be successful because an online class taker had all the time to finish every work the lack of efficiency would not be a skill an online class taker would have. A student who take classes in school would most likely most be OK with working over time and a home course learner might deny the request.

Students who stay home to learn by taking online courses might have some skill that an in school student might not have like the stay home student is gonna have to be more dependent on self because they would have to depend on their self to do everything without the help of an expert. As in the act of careers the student that take courses can be more responsible and dependent on to work on other stuff even though the student that was in school would have that skill the student that took online classes might have it even more because they never had any help ever they would be more experienced.

The benefits in taking an in school course is very useful in every kids life because it help with the most important skill being social skill it makes a person more used to the different behaviors of people and how to go about certain situations and how to solve them and also the skill to work in any destructive situations no matter what the situation is you should able cancel it out and focus on the real work thats important to you in the situation also some other benefits are in physical education, student might have a passion for some kind of sport being participated in school and can join teams and other resourceful meeting that can helping that kind of career but an online class student that stay home can never join a team to figure out their future because they would never have a chance in trying it out .And a student in school can also learn from others mistakes around other students and make sure they never repeat the same mistakes. A student staying home to take online classes will never have a chance to learn from others mistakes because well they would be home with no social life and no regrets in no bad decisions.

Although students at home taking online classes would probably be more dependent on their self and have better grades, it should be known that every student or kid should have the accessibility to a social interactive life and some skills that needs to be picked up by a student or some responsibility of growing up. Staying home and taking courses has it's perks but it also a bad decision because the child could lack all the responsibilities needed in the near future. it could help with lots like self dependent . While student that go to in school have more experience and then some that a stay home online class taker might be missing like the responsibility of owning to your mistakes , learning from others mistakes u can learn to work in destructive surroundings and have all the social skills needed and try out for your own career in whether it's physical skills or hands on.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
DD66EBC605D1,"Some schools offer the option of attending classes by ""online"" or ""video conferencing"". This may not be a good idea because how does the student going to get responsible? or how can the teachers know if the student is not cheating on a test?. Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. Also, by this way attending to school students might join in sports, activities, etc. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. School gives classes of ""PE"" which is important because doing sports is healthy.

In 2015, a student at Generic_School took the option to attend classes by online because the student was not a ""social"" person which means the student did not like to communicate. But after all the student did regret it. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. The words of the student to advice the students were "" There is no more benefits than attending to school. School does help you to your knowdlegde and prepare you for your future. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you ""P.E"" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone."" The student had excellent grades, scholarships, made new friends than he expected to have. Where is he now by making the best option? He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had.

As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called ""Esol"". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different system's programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will.

In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. Going to school has more benefits than you think so you need to fight for it because anything in this life is not easy, but is worth it.

3C879A5C86D9,"Why would you sacrifice your whole social life just to take classes online? When children stay home from school they are either sick or just don't wanna come and usually its just that they dont wanna come. I know when i stay home i am bored within seconds wondering what my friends are doing at school. If students were to attend school they would get the high school experience, more hands on learning, and a better understanding of the work being given. Some people may say students should be able to attend classes at home. They are wrong because most students can barely pay attention at school so why would they even try at home.

When you go to school you make friends and meet new people almost everyday, but when your home all day everyday how are you supposed to make friends when you have never attended school. School is a easy way for children of all ages to come out of their comfort zone and experience new things. Students not attending school would stop them from building bonds, meeting new people and experiencing the outside world. When your attending classes online you can basically say your isolated from others because you would spend most your time in the house doing work on a computer. Some people may say you can still have a social life when not attending school. They are wrong because how can you have a social life when you have no time to meet new people.

There are many different ways that teachers teach and different techniques they use. Not all of their ideas may work but the one way most students learn is with hands on activities. This is because students have to be able to picture what they are learning in order to comprehend the work. For example, in math class teachers use blocks and colors for students to understand the lesson and this helps show them different ways of going about the equations. When doing hands on actives its an easy way of putting what you have learned to use while still learning the lesson. Some people may say students will learn whether its hands on or not. They are wrong because how can a students learn something when they haven't practiced others ways of going about the problem.

Students get work back to back on a everyday basis and probably only understand half of it. Then the teachers expects us to learn all the work by this and that time. How can one understand the work and their at home sitting behind a computer ? Students have to be able to ask question when in class in order to understand the work they are being given but how can you do that when your not face to face with your teacher. When trying to talk to your teacher about work they assigned it is easier to be able to show them the work and they help you work through the problem with you and not keep sending emails back and forth. Being able to communicate with your students psychically and show them each step of the lesson is a easy way to understand the lesson better. Some people may say as long as you pay attention online you'll get the work. They are wrong because being face to face with your teachers will help you understand the lesson in a better.

Clearly, students attending school is a better option because they would get the high school experience, more hands on learning, and a better understanding of the work being given. Some people may say students should be able to attend classes at home however, they are wrong because most students can barely pay attention at school so why would they even try at home. If the school board felt that students should have the option of attending classes at home then there would be way more numbers in home schooling. In my opinion students should wanna go to school for many different reasons because even though its comes with a lot of work learning can be fun at time.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F0B7D3D08407,"Distance learning is a unique way for students to learn and incorporate their school life, in the compfort of their home. While distance learning may seem like the best possible way to go, you still need to keep in mind the pros and cons of a situation like this. Most online classes do offer a more flexible schedual, but at what cost?

The current school that I am attending offers some online courses that some of my fellow classmates have participated in. I asked their opinions on online classes and they mostly shone a negative light onto this subject. One of the negative aspects of an online course, is that you don't get to speak face to face with a teacher. Some studies that I have read have shown that face to face communication is more effective than online chatting. When a conversation is held face to face, you can better understand the tone and emotions that a person is trying to convey.

To add on too my last paragraph, it also helps when you can interact with your other peers. When you have someone else around your age who understands what is being thought, they can better help explain the subject to you if you didn't understand the teacher. Also, it helps when you have classmates to make you laugh and take your mind of a hard moment. If you take an online class, you are typically by yourself and have nobody to associate with.

Another disadvantage of online classes are the temptations it provides. If you are in the compfort of your own home surrounded by things you like, you might be tempted to pick up your phone to check a text or, go outside to play with your new puppy. This may cause you struggle in the online class, because the distractions are affecting your ability to comprehend what is being thought. Some people will still choose to have an online course because it better suites their learning style.

At the end of the day, I still beileive that a traditonal classroom experience is the best way to go. You still get your education while also gettting the oppurtunity to have a hands on and social learning experience.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
678F9DC7579A,"Technology has helped innovate the world we live in today. Decades ago, a simple task of writing a letter and sending it off would take days to weeks to deliver; now simply sending an email takes only a few seconds to receive. The rate at which technology has grown and impacted humans is remarkable. This as a result has made individuals rely on technology in their daily lives. This can be shown in various ways across different individuals, one of which are students. Students would benefit from taking classes at home because a world wide pandemic might cause the closings of schools, certain students might not live near a school, and students might be handling tough situations that require them to stay at home.

A contagious virus or disease may prompt schools to close due to it simply not being safe to go to school. Being home is beneficial because that is a place of isolation where outside factors like diseases would be hard to contract. This would also help limit the amount of people being infected and keeping the disease contained. In the past, my middle school was shut down due to a high number of Flu cases. This prompted for a closure of the school for two weeks. The only way to receive the education we were going to miss was by implementing online school. Furthermore, completing online school during that time period helped ensure that I was not behind on school work.

The far distance of a school for certain students maybe a factor as to why they can't attend it. This can hinder ones attempt to learn, but with the rise of technology and its easy accessibility, online school has been seen as a solution. The many benefits of technology is that it can come in different forms (phones and laptops) and can reach remote areas of the world. As a result, taking part in online school helps make sure that students that live far from school, get the education they need. Personally, I have taken part in online classes because my teacher was in another country. Through technology and online school, I was able to successfully learn despite the long distance.

Students may not be able to come to school due to liabilities they have to attend to. Certain students may have to take care of their younger siblings because their parents maybe at work. This limits the chance the student has on receiving adequate education. An alternative would be getting a chance to do schoolwork at home where that student can take care of their siblings while learning. This can be seen in online school where schedules are made by the student for their own convenience. Therefore, this would be more efficient for that student.

Due to the advancements of technology, it has drastically helped humans to become more productive and efficient. It has helped complete tasks that would be deemed impossible years ago. With this, it has helped the way students are taught by making teaching methods go digital (online school). As a result, students might find completing schoolwork at home easier due to the safe environment and the fact that it is more convenient because it is set at their own pace.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9329A9DD13F2,"Parents are always looking for new ways to give their student the best education possible, but for some, the options available are not suitable for their student. Distance learning is a possible new option in which students can learn from home using online classes and possible video contact with their teachers. Students should have the option to attend class at home because it will allow students who are often absent to miss less of the curriculum and allow for easier catch up if work is missed, allow students who struggle with social situations to learn and ask questions in a stress-free environment, and give students the time they need to learn material or complete certain assignments.

Online classes will allow students who have frequent absences to attend class and make up work with more ease. Students miss school for many reasons, such as illness, travel, or family struggles, and each of these possibilities are often unavoidable. Classes at home would allow more flexibility for these students. In all cases, the ability to be at home would also allow these students to work when convenient, whether it is when they are feeling better or they have down time on a trip. Students should still be allowed absences in certain circumstances. If they miss a class, rather than having all of their work piled up and having to schedule time with each teacher, they can do the work from home, not having to worry about the schedules of anyone but themselves. A great example is students with poor immune systems that get sick quite often. Depending on the severity of the illness, students who are home sick could attend classes without the fear of contaminating others or getting exposed to worse germs, and allow them to avoid a place that houses countless bacteria and viruses that could cause an illness at any time.

Not only this, but on a day that a sick student stays home from school, they often have periods of feeling better and having more energy, so these periods could be utilized for working on classwork, a luxury that is not available in a school building. If this same student were taking classes at school and missed an assessment in class, they would have to schedule time outside of that class and coordinate to find a time that is available for both them and their teacher to make up the work. However, if this student missed an assessment that was online, they would be able to make it up any time that they are free, not having the restrictions of seven hours of a tight packed schedule or specific times in the day. Distance classes would allow for less absences and missing work, improving the experience of both students and teachers.

Some adults may be concerned that at home learning would deprive students of face to face interaction on a daily basis, but for some students, these interactions cause unnecessary stress that hinders their learning. Anxiety is becoming increasingly more common and that anxiety is often caused by social interactions. For students with such stresses, asking questions in class and asking teachers or fellow students for help is very difficult. The ability to ask such questions online will make them more comfortable and able to learn. If a student is unable to ask a question in class because they fear that they will be judged or make a mistake, they will continue to be confused about whatever it is they had a question about. If the class they are taking is online, that student could ask their teacher a question privately, with the ability to edit their phrasing, and get an answer the way they can understand it. Students would not have the everyday interaction of a usual classroom atmosphere, but students that choose at home classes will have greater benefits and can seek connections in a more comfortable setting for them.

Giving the option of at home classes would allow students to get a more personalized education. Every student has a different way of learning, so, many students struggle through classes because they are not being taught the way they learn best. Some students learn best by taking notes, while others learn by doing hands on activities. Some students can hear something once and be able to understand fully, while others take more time to process. At home classes gives students the ability to take the time they need to learn material and complete classwork. One student may only have to listen to a teacher lecture and take little to no notes to understand a topic. Another student may need to listen, take extensive notes, and reread or write their notes in order to gain a fraction of the understanding, but they are not able to do this in class. If the expectation in a class is that you are able to complete an activity after 30 minutes of a teacher talking, but that is not how some students learn, those students will be lost and fall behind the others. With classes at home and online, they would be able to take the time they needed to grasp a topic before moving on to use what they just learned. At home learning allows students to practice the learning style that helps them learn the best.

Distance learning should be an option for students because they are able to stay on top of their work when they are not at their best, have a learning environment that works well for them, and have the time needed to learn material. Just like any other new way of learning, there are concerns, but the benefits of distance learning greatly outweigh those concerns. This type of learning is only one of the many options for parents and students to choose from in order to get the best education and though it may not be best for some students, that should not take away the option from others.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

DAF339DC4E48,"Generic_School offers students an eighth block period which is a period that will take place after school, at home, and online. Classes like this are offered at many schools and this distanced learning has become common. Some schools are even allowing students to take their full schedule online. Some people question whether or not students even benefit from this. I for one believe students can benefit from theses courses. Students can benefit from the option of taking classes at home because students who excel can take an extra class when they get home after the school day is over, kids who work best in quiet environments or are introverted would do better, and students who get bullied by peers wouldnt have to worry about dealing with bullies anymore.

Some students truly go above and beyond in their learning and education, and they could handle more work than what's given in school with ease,but its only when we challenge ourselves that we are able to grow. The workload of their normal classes will never be enough for theses students to fill their needs. But this distance learning course will allow these students who wish for more of a challenge to engage in more school time which is great for the student. Now hypothetically speaking, if you boss asked you to read ten student's papers but you could read twenty, although you're reaching your quota, you arent reaching your fullest potential.

People may say that all the time needed is given during the school day. This is blasphemous because its neglectful of the students with straight A's, in AP classes, who still arent challenged. For muscles to grow there needs to be an overload, a point where you push your muscles to their limits, and the same goes for your brain. Some people need more to push themselves, and not allowing this is a hindrance to their mental growth. No matter what the activity may be there will always be someone who excels beyond the limits of the common folk. Whether that be sports, Art,or video games, someone will be better than everyone else. Offering this course allows students who are above the learning curve to improve and not stay stagnant.

People vary in their social skills and ability to work around people. As humans we are created different and we must respect these differences in people. Some people work best in large groups ,some work best alone, some people can work through the noise of the classmates around them ,and some need complete silence. It would be wrong to not offer these classes for the students who need to be alone to work or those who would rather work in the comfort of their home. For instance if you had stage fright and your boss told you,""You have to read these papers in front of the others."" you'd be nervous. Anything from stuttering or saying a word wrong could effect your job, but this wouldnt be a problem if you could do it in the comfort of your own home. One could argue that being anti-social is no reason to take classes at home but on the contrary people who are anti-social find it hard to speak in front of the class, work on group assignments, read for the class, or present their project in front of the class all of which can affect their grade. So these kids are now not only being graded on there knowledge but now also whether or not they're willing to carry out these task against their fears. This is unfair to these students who now have to go through a more emotional struggle than the other students. But in the comfort of their home these socially challenged students dont have to worry about anything other then there work and this will benefit their work flow.

Some students are challenged with being bullied by classmates which can lead to problems in more than just their schoolwork. Being bullied can lead to depression, fights, and even school shootings. These things bring problems, not only to the kid being bullied,but the bully themselves, the friends and family of the two ,and ,in worst cases, the community. Imagine if you were at work and had to read student's papers with your coworkers but every time you made a mistake they made fun of you. Eventually that tension between the two of you would cause problems. Someone might say to remove the problem and tell the bully to stop ,but there have been plenty of anti-bullying movements and yet none of them have worked. But if students where able to take classes at home there would be no problem. The bully taking his classes at home has no one to bully ,and the victim doesnt have to worry about them bully anymore.

Overall the idea of distance learning and taking classes from home is great because it allows people to grow, feel comfortable when learning, and feel safe. A world where were kept within standards and cant go to your own limits ,or where you are forced to do things that make your skin crawl on a daily basis ,or you cant simply feel safe to get your education is a world without online learning. The opportunity to takes classes at home is amazing because it frees students from limits, discomfort, and fear.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
A66B93C3C8F1,"Does taking online classes benefits your knowledge?

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend home by way of online or video conferencing. This great opportunity give differences options to the students interesting in different environment of learning;therefore some people take this option to discern their own future. Take position of our own responsibilities it is a benefit to grow in our own knowledge. Not all humans beings with the same opportunities in life,yet this option it is a great help for many students with trials or obstacles attending school,but with the objective to get a career in the future.

In my position in this issue it is basically in the techniques of learning opportunities, so they can focus in what their doing,obtain a better concentration ,and they can not distract with other students; while the students can get a better storage of learning and better grow of knowledge......sometimes the majority of students taking online classes finish school before regular students. In my other hand they can have more options to expend their times, and they can organize their own activities, they can practice: deports, learn to play instruments, classes of differences languages,or get a job;this activities can help you to prepare your own adult life. Be volunteer it is other curricular option to practice your own values, but some people can not practice this activity because it is during time of school,so taking online classes permit employ and organize your own time.

Other big topic of my choice is the single mothers,unfortunately people make mistakes,but in the main time affect their future;therefore this opportunity benefit to them because they need to pay to somebody to take care of the baby ,and they need to find a job for survive; this opportunity make more flexible their life. Other of my examples is that part of some students leave school, because their parents need to work,and they need to support their family to survive,getting money,finding a job,taking care of their siblings,or helping with home responsibilities.

In this days the significant of values is lost,other of the benefits taking online classes it is that people can save their values without relationships or persons that can not change your personality,many times when you go to regular school you know persons that change your main of thought,behave,and see that provoke consequences for your own future, because you take incorrect decisions. The opportunity to take classes online make your life more safe, and make feel your parents more faithful to know with who you relate;taking online classes make yourself more responsible of your achieves, because if you decided take online classes depends just you if you completed and graduated.

In my other hand,people believe this is not a good option for ESOL students because it is a difficult task learn other language, and taking online classes do not help you,learn other language consist in first place listening stage,and this requirement the support of a teacher to explain and remark what you do not understand;the teacher can give you the answers of all questions that you have, other stage it is the writing part, and people disagree to use translated because you do not learn,and would be more difficult in the future to go to the collage, and the speaking stage it is important too,but if you take online classes and you do not practice it is more difficult achieve the purpose and learn the language.

This great opportunity give differences options to the students interesting in different environment of learning;therefore some people take this option to discern their own future;this issue it is basically in the techniques of learning opportunities,so they can focus in what their doing,obtain a better concentration ,and they can not distract with other students; while the students can get a better storage of learning and better grow of knowledge,and the majority of students taking online classes finish school before regular students.

857FAF7C385C,"Some schools in Virginia are adopt a program that benefit students that can't be in school for some reason. I agree with the idea,this idea consist that students can attend to their classes from home by the way of video conference or online.First, students with health problems are going to be benefit.Second, also students that have responsibilities in their homes, how having a full time job, can finish school with the help of this program.Finally, students that have problem with transport are also benefit with this awesome idea.On the other hand, some patterns said that their children have to be in school and have the same treat than other students and that schools should find another way to help these students.

I think the idea is going to be a great help for students with health problems.First, when my sister was in school she had problem with her legs and its' was very difficult for her to come to school every day,if this idea was approved four years ago it will help my sister a lot. Second, students with health issues in my school were very happy went their heard about the idea that our school was implemented so, its very difficult for they to come school when their feel bad. Finally, my friend PROPER_NAME is 15 years old he get sick easily his body defense are not like the others people and he was very happy when he heard the notice, he told me "" I can't believe that our school thought on me and the others students with disabilities"" I told him that I was very happy for him.

Students with responsibilities are also benefit.First, they can get a job and finish high school in the same time.Second,they can contribute on the house paying some bills how: pay their own room,bulling their food, or paying water and electricity bills.Finally, they are going to be in school and it is not going to affect them, if they are planning go to college in their future.

Students that have transport problem also apply. First, some students live to far and is difficult for they come to school and this idea is something that their are considering.Second, some students used Uber to come school and it is very expensive, some of them can't pay 10 to 30 dollars per day.Finally, some patterns are thinking to change their sons for another school that can provide transport to their sons.

In conclusion, students with health problems how my sister and PROPER_NAME are going to be benefit.Also many students that have responsibilities, like have a job to help their families students will help them and in the same time they are going to finish their school.Finally, students with transport problems can apply to the program many of them live to far and its hard to come school every day. I hope this idea can be implemented in many schools and help a lot kids like is helping the students in my School.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EB4FE2D03A6F,"Education plays an important role in the daily life of many youths. Many teenagers value schools as places where they can learn subjects, skills, and topics, as well as connect with teachers and classmates. In most cases, students are required to be physically present in class. However, there are several occasions where students miss class.

Some might not have access to transportation, some might have emergency issues, or some might be on vacation. When they miss class, sstudents might experience additional stress or anxiety, as they struggle to stay on top of classwork. Now, some schools are offering distance learning as a solution. Distance learning allow studennts to work from home or other places outside of school through video or online conferencing. Distance learning is advantageous for students because students are able to attend class despite being in the middle of a difficult situation- no access to transportation, an emergency problem, or a family vacation.

Distance learning provides students who do not have access to transportation or live far away from school a way to learn. Transportation is one of the many challenges that teenagers have to face. While older youths might own cars, many students do not yet have access to cars or other methods of transportation. Therefore, students find themselves frustrated when they are unable to attend necessary classes. In addition, some students might live at a far distance from school. These students who do not live close to their schools may have to take additional time to get to their classes. Often, they are late and sometimes, they miss their classes.

Through distance learning and online or video meetings, students are able to learn the same materials at home. Although they are not at school, distance learning provides a similar setting to most classrooms, with the teacher lecturing and students listening. Frequently, students will participate in activities in subjects such as Chemistry or Physics. Because this enables students to learn the materials that are needed, it also reduces students' frustrations about having to catch up late work or assignments.

Second, distance learning can be a solution to students who have to face emergency issues. Emergency issues are a common problem and are often unexpected. They can occur with close family members, relatives, or friends. In these occasions, it is appropriate that the students are at the location. As a result, some students who might have been planning to attend class might not be able to.

Distance learning allows students to virtually attend class at any time, rather than in a set specific time. Therefore, students who are dealing with emergency situations can be updated on the class whenever it is most suitable for them. In this way, students reduce the worries of struglling behind in class. In conclusion, distance learning allows students to not only take care of their close family and friends, but also have access to education at the same time. .

Another occasion in which students might experience benefits from distance learning is when they are at a vacation or a location outside of their city or town. Many families plan a family vacation in the school year, which require students to miss class. When they return from their vacation, however, students find themselves in a devastating position with insurmountable amount of class work. Through online or video conferencing, youths can attend classes in any setting, whether it is outside of town or outside the country. Because distance learning does not require students to be physically present in the classroom, students can eliminate their worries about being absent in class or missing a demonstration.

For example, if a student is not able to attend his/her

English class for a book discussion, they can easily connect online to participate in the activity with his/her classmates. Therefore, distance learning is an effective way that helps help students learn, no matter their location.

Some opponents of distance learning might argue that online or video conferencing might not be as engaging as being physically present in a classroom. For instance, many science classes assign labs with hands-on activities for students to participate in. However, distance learning is as encouraging for students at home or other locations as it is for students in class. This is because in many cases, labs or any other activities often are done virtually online. Online websites such as Phet Lab or any other reliable sources offer students with visual simulations that exemplify real labs. In addition, even though students might not be able to participate in the full hands-on experience, they can still see demonstrations and methods on how to complete the experiment.

In conclusion, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students. This action is necessary because students can learn important materials in different settings and locations outside of school. Whether they are unable to attend because of their distance from school, emergency problems, or vacations, students can participate in activties and learn materials through online or video conferencing. Furthermore, students can work in engaging situations through online simulations. Although distance learning offers a new and different approach, it still achieves the same purpose as a classroom by providing students with education.     ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

Some think distance learning is not effective sent because what if you don't under stand and have several questions that need to ve answer right away? Some believe it is the fetcher of schools. If a one Student don't attend to class for personal reasons distance learning is the best solution. People are still arguing about this problem. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing from home. Distance learning option is effective because students work most of the day. If they miss School for personal reasons and safe Environment.

Many study showed Most high school students and college students work at least 3/4 days a week. Students are very tired though out the day. That means students are not doing there best at school. If schools are offer distance learning options from home they put better effort on the task they are given because they will get enough sleep and rest.

Every student have different things to deal with out side of school and some times those things can get in the way of school. If a student miss day of school for many reasons like Doctor Appointment, Vacation, Sickness and other many reasons. He or She can attend to class from other places online or video conference. It helps students to manege school and other personal things.

The final reason why distance learning is better is because it is safe. when students go to school they can be exposed a lots of bad things like drags, alcohol and others. Schools are not the safest environment for students. School Shooting,Physical Bulging are major problem and distance learning will solve those problems that are listed above. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way of online or video conferring.

My heart pounded in my ears so loudly to the point where I could not hear what my theatre director, Generic_Name, said next. After telling the cast that all Generic_City schools would be closed on Monday for the teachers to better prepare for potentially having to teach students at a distance due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, Generic_Name explained that there was a possibility we would sadly not be able to put on our spring play and the students might have to take online classes for a certain amount of time. In this day and age where technology dominates the world, a decent amount of schools worldwide are pushing for more online classes to be available. Students would not benefit from taking classes at home because there are many students who don't learn best through self-led classes and students would miss out on the classic interactive classroom experience.

As many teachers learn through their personal studies and time spent in the classroom, there are many different types of learning styles that must be catered to in order to set a foundation for a student's success, therefore, teachers must be physically present if a student needs help. I remember when I was a freshman and my history teacher decided to not physically teach the class anymore because a group of students were making fun of his teaching style. All of our classwork was posted online and we had to direct ourselves through our lessons. When it came test time, my normally prominant ""A"" became a ""D"" after completely failing the exam. I was affected by the fact that I didn't comprehend what I thought I had learned over that past month and felt like my time had been wasted. I didn't learn anything by ""teaching myself"" because my job as a student should be to learn, not to do both. My sister, Generic_Name, shared a memory with me from elementary school that also exemplifies this where her 6th grade teacher had the students guide themselves through an online math unit. When Generic_Name was a confused about a problem and tried to ask a question, the teacher said that the questions had to be limited, as it was a self-directed class. As an anxious 12 year old, this caused her not to do her best in school not only because the teacher wasn't allowed to answer her questions, but because she didn't digest what she learned through the technology. Elementary schoolers are not developed enough to take on directing themselves through their education. Frankly, elementary schoolers are not mature enough for that level of responsibility, and maturity is not something that can be taught online.

Not only can disciplinary actions not be monitored, but also the energy that a classroom brings can not be recreated virtually through technology; only through the good old-fashioned interactive environment. My friend, Generic_Name, is currently enrolled in two online courses: History and English. I once told her that I had won a lollipop while playing a fun Kahoot game in English. She told me how much she misses playing Kahoots with a group of people. Online classes are meant to be rigorous, but they leave no room for students to have a break. Generic_Name mentions that she can find review games online, but when a whole classroom isn't competing against each other for a piece of candy it simply does not match that level of excitement. Classes are meant to push students and challenge them, but what many adults forget is that teens are people too and sometimes need an enticement to make learning fun, like the review game I played in geosystems. These games can not be experienced the same way virtually as opposed to a classroom. In my U.S. History class this year, we have switched back and forth each unit between writing a DBQ essay and having a socratic seminar. I have found it more beneficial to do a socratic seminar because I love feeding off of what other people have to say about the challenging topics we discuss and I found that I learn more from my peers than from the research we have to do for our DBQ essays. The online classes do not have a socratic seminar option because there has to be other students present to perform one. Learning from others, especially one's peers, is something that carries into the real world through jobs, relationships, and even in electing government officials. Human interaction is fundamental to one's growth, and online classes do not cater to that.

While online classes do have their drawbacks, they also have their perks. Some say that online classes make it so that students can work around their own schedule. It is true that students can work at their own time and speed through online classes, but being physically in a classroom provides more structure to the curriculum through already built in time. A scenario that exemplifies this is earlier this year my Algebra 2 teacher told us that the only way we could review for our test was if we video called with her at 8pm the night before. It wasn't mandatory, but it was highly encouraged. Since I'm not the best at math I decided I would tune in, but that night was my sister's band concert and I missed the call. The online call did not work around my schedule and I did not get to review for my test. Online classes seem like the schedule is flexible, and granted a lot of times they are, but there are times like this where a later scheduled class conflicts with a student's personal life.

Technology is one of the most useful creations of our generation and having online classes is taking advantage of it in a positive way. But it is also causing many students to fail classes and affecting young people's lack of ability to have social interactions; online classes ony fuel the fire. With the recent outbreak of the Coronavirus it is unknown what the future holds for online teaching. What is known, however, is the more we allow technology to dominate our lives, the faster it will take over the world.                                                ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
58358B109222,"I think that attending classes from home can benefit students by giving them the freedom to take classes on their own time. Students who live in a different state or country can attend classes if they can't move. Being in the class can be a handful for many students,so schools offering distance learning is a great alternative for students. Imagine that you are somebody that wants to go to a certain school but you cant because you don't have money to move, you can attend your classes online. Students who work and can't attend classes can attend them online so they won't miss out on work or school.

Whether you're at home or in the classroom you are still getting the same learning, but it would be different at home than in the classroom. Being at home gives you the same benefits of being in the classroom and then some and it gives students opportunity to spend time with their family, but compared to being in school it doesn't give you the opportunity to socialize with your classmates. In school the teacher might give out an activity that requires you to come together as a group to finish the work, but if you are attending from home you can't do the same things they do at school. If you attend from home it gives you the opportunity to focus on your classes on your own time and also focus on your ambitions or hobbies that interest you.

5171E1D8A82A,"With societies advancements in technology, we have made it possible for students to take courses online from anywhere. Although some question whether this is very beneficial to have these online classes. These online classes allow the student to learn more one one one and it lets the teacher better focus on their struggles. Not only does online school benefit regular students but, it also helps to teach student who are bedridden in hospitals to learn while they are recovering.

Teachers are able to teach the student more directly while also having the ability to adjust to what the student needs in order to further benefit. The majority of the time in a classroom with about thirty students it is difficult to help with all the individual needs of a student when there is only one teacher to assist them. Along with how some students who are too nervous to ask questions about what they are confused about. Online classes allows the teacher to work with a smaller group or with one person and be more focus on an individual. Many parents though are concerned that with online classes their child will have more of a tendency to slack off with school work. This is not the case however, since all of their work is online they would not have much of an excuse to not have the assignment incomplete. Assessments will be monitored through sharing their computer screen and having access to their web cam.

There are many children in hospitals who spend a lot of time in the hospital and are not able to attend school but with online school it can benefit them for the long run. My cousin has spent most of his life in the hospital without the ability to go to school since part of his body had been paralyzed. My aunt had put him in online classes so when he was able to get out the hospital he had a chance to earn a living for himself. The online session with his teacher helped him become educated but also it let him be able to rehabilitate at the hospital since the sessions were based on his time. He would have a video sessions where the teacher would show him how to do things. This later on in life made him able to become the engineer that he is today. Not only does this help the student but it keeps the teacher safe if the student has an illness that is highly contagious.

The internet reaches the vast majority of the world allowing anyone to learn via the computer. It helps those that cannot be home schooled to have access to someone who is able to help them along through their learning progress. From people who are ill to those that require a more direct approach online learning benefits many.

Although I do think that it really depends whether or not the student will take the classes seriously or will play around with the free extra time. I think it would still be beneficial.

For example,if a student wants to participate in an extra curricular activity that requires traveling the student can't do that unless he or she is taking classes online. However,If a student decides to take online classes but does not take extra activities then there is no reason for he or she not to attend regular school. For example, I personally struggle with this issue. I take modeling and acting as an extra activity outside of school.

Over the past couple of years, the uprising of technology has increased by over twenty percent. With this being stated, schools across the country have offered distance learning as an option for students to attend class without actually having to be in a classroom. This new technique includes video conferencing which allows people to listen in on a teacher's lesson, and online video chatting which allows the student to communicate with an instructor face to face. The new age of technology has quickly overtaken the traditional standpoint of how students should be instructed. These new online suggestions prevent a student's one on one help from a teacher, take away the ability to work with others, and prevent them from a hands on learning experience.

One on one help is a key factor to help maintain a student's success rate within the classroom. One on one help gives any student the opportunity to ask an instructor for individual help on any given test, quiz, or assignment. This also encourages the student to receive teacher feedback on how to improve their work ethic, thought process, and learning capabilities. One on one help is a traditional learning skill that has been in effect for over many decades. This resource is used by millions of people each and everyday and beneficial to people outside of school buildings. This can include jobs, businesses, and local pharmacies. It's always important that a student is aware of his/her capabilities so that they know what to improve on and how to achieve it. When a student becomes successful at this objective, students should then be at a comfort level where they should be asking their teachers questions and tips on how to be successful

In addition to one on one help, students also rely on the ability of working with others. Working with others is a major role in the development of teenage growth and maturity levels when in the classroom. This gives the students the time to come together and encourage one another's idea and thought process. Teamwork is a good social skill to obtain while in school because it will eventually carry out into life outside of school, like in the work force. In research shown, working in a group relieves stress, opens the mind to new ideas, and increases the chances of making new friends by ten percent. Group activities define character, display social skills, and show the importance of being able to cooperate with others.

Hands on learning is the most essential skill in the traditional style of learning. Even some of the most famous athletes in the world benefit from hands on learning, such as Lamar Jackson, Michael Vick, Michael Jordan, and LeBron James. Hands on learning experiences give the student an opportunity to correct his/her mistakes, learn from others, and bounce back from adversity. This is an essential life lesson that a person can only learn by attending school. Without hands on experience, students will never understand the mentality and proper mindset it takes in order to become a successful student. While in school, students should be accustomed to their own experience when trying new things and be at the point where they are comfortable working independently.

Students all over the world have their own unique style of learning. Some feel technological standpoints are better while others believe the traditional style is better. Both can be efficient in their own way. Personally, the traditional style has my vote because of the many processes that have paved the way for me. Although online or video conferencing from at home sounds interesting, I feel that being at school and getting the help needed from the teacher in person will always be more beneficial.

As shown in research, working with others increased the chances of making friends by ten percent. With the continued use of these traditional learning skills, students will continue to succeed in school, get accepted into many colleges, and receive many job offers. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8315F09ED7A6,"Imagine waking up everyday knowing the day would be spent working on school work. Most kids dread going to school, but look forward to going home because they feel like they can finally relax. If most kids enjoy the time they spend at home then why would they want to spend their time working on more school work? Students may not benefit from attending online classes from home because they would not be exposed to the social aspect of school, one on one relationships with teachers, and the learning experiences public school provides.

Students may not benefit from attending online classes from home because they would not be exposed to the social aspect of school. One example of the social aspects of public school includes making friends and learning how to socialize at a young age. If a student is kept away from other kids most of their life and gets sent off to a public high school or university they typically struggle more than the average teen. This is because, unlike everyone else who has developed a skill on conversing with others and making friends, most home schooled kids are generally only exposed to their families or family friends. Also, public speaking is another great social aspect of public school. From an early age students have to present projects and book talks to their teachers and classmates. This prepares them for nearly every job in the real world. These are only a few reasons why the social aspects of public schools are important.

Students may not benefit from attending online classes from home because they would not be exposed to the one-on-one relationships with teachers. When a student is put in a classroom setting they learn how to build relationships with their teachers. Students develop a natural skill throughout school that makes it easier for them to talk to adults. Because of this students feel more comfortable talking to their teacher about problems they may have concerning the class. In addition to, a student would not be able to easily ask questions and get help over a computer. Through technology a student would not be able to get more than an explanation concerning their questions; however, in a classroom setting the teacher usually sets aside time for questions and can help their students one-on-one.

Lastly, students may not benefit from attending online classes from home because they would not be exposed to the learning experiences public school provides. In public school they offer high school sports teams or group activities that expose kids to teamwork. Teamwork is an important skill because although people may not always like who they are working with it is something that everyone has to deal with and work through their entire life. Another experience public school provides for children and teens is life lessons. Some of these life lessons include not always being the best at everything or making mistakes. Many kids who have to deal with these tough life lessons learn how to pick themselves up and push through the hardships because they understand they will only make them tougher. This is just the tip of the iceberg for all the learning experiences public school provides that students will not experience during online school.

Learning experiences, social aspects, and one-on-one relationships are all valid and logical reasons that students should choose public school over online schooling. Although there may be great aspects of online school who would not want to experience public school?",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DA892A0397A7,"Distance learning through video conferencing or online is a great benifit to students. It allows for any students who may be very ill for a long period of time to not fall behind anf stay caught up with other students. It also is great for people who may need to travel out of town, they would still be able to understand what is going on in their classes. Lastly, it allows student who's grandparents or parents need to be taken care of to stay home and take care of their gardeiens, while staying up to date with their education. Distance learning is a great way for students going through hard times, making it difficult for them to get to school, to stay caught up with their classes. If distance learning was not available, it would make education very difficult for those who have health promblems or home problems. Education is ver important in our country, it keeps people from being homeless and help our country industrialize even more. When people do not get a good education that can be adaptable to their lifestylr, often times it can end up in homelessness and great a more rigid class structure.

Homelives are not the same for everyone, some people come from a home where they are very well taken care of and do not have to worry about their financial situation, however other people come from homes where as a teenager you must work and help provide for your family. When you have to help provide for your family, it makes school much more difficult and often time those teens will drop out of highschool to keep their families alfloat. By offereing ditance learning, you give teenager who have to provide for their family a better aducation and a greater chance to graduate from highschool. Distance learning gives teens the oppertunity to gain their education and credits to graduate from home, where they can still help take care of loved ones who may not be able to go out and get a job or care for themselves.

Illnesses or injuries can tear someone up and completly ruin their passsion for education, as well as make it difficult for them to attend school. Offering students distance learning lets them stay caught up in school, whether it be from homw or even a hospital bed. I personally have retained many injuries and a few illnesses and it has made it very difficult to come to school and still be able to have enough energy to come home and get my work down. As an junior, I decided to take three AP classes and only one elective per semester which is difficult even before you add injuries, personal problems, and Mono to it. Previously this year I found out I had Mono, I was tired all the time, barely had enough energy to do anything, had an awful rash, and just wanted to stay in bed all day. However, I could not stay in bed all day for three months and knew I had to go to school, even if it prolonged the illness. If I had been offered distance learning through video conferencing, I would have been able to stay to date on everything, and my grades would not have flucuated like they did. Offering distance learning give people who cannot attend school due to illnesses and injuries to stay caught up on their school work and understand what is going on in those classes. Not only does it give these teenagers a chance to learn freely at home and stay healthy, but it will also help keep their grades good keep them from flucuating.

Many students often miss school to travel out of town, whether it's for a wedding, funeral, vacation, or their parents job, they all still miss school. If video conferencing is offered, it will keep these students up to date and everything will still get turned in on times, because they are not missing their classes. It will keep more students in class and keeppeople from getting behind on work. Although, some kids might try to take advantage of this and try to skip school, they will still have to attend the video conferencing to get credit for being at school and attending class, so these students will not be missing anything.

Distance learning is a great opertunity to keep more students in school, keep their grades up, and offer better oppertuntires for those who cannot attend school due to their homelife. By offering this type of learning, you adapt to your students way of life, hepl improve your education school, and give out many oppertunities and chances for teenagers who often times are not offered a second chance or imporovements to what they are going through. DIstance learning will help better your community, and give more people the opertunity for a great education. When people are educated, it leads to a better lifestyle for future generations. Help improve the future by jumping on the bandwagon and offering distance learning.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
BCA02BA3F766,"Would students benefit from learning from video conferences at home? I very much disagree with this answer because should attend school in person and actually learn and it would be more effective for them instead sitting at home. If a student has like a medical condition that forces them stay home or keep them home bound, that's the only way they can get their education. If a student was to take online classes, it would the environment that they are in could be a distraction to their learning and it is better for the student to attend school in person and be face to face with teachers and get the same learning experience as everyone else. Also, students that learn from home from home, they can easily cheat at anytime and access notes without the online school knowing and the students wouldn't learn anything from it.

Most people think that online school is good for their students but it really isnt and is it not effective at all. Students that learn through online school can be a huge distraction for them because they are in the comfort of their home and the things around can easily distract the student like phones, their parents, and everything that is around them. Since the student the student thinks because they take online school thinks they can do the work later and go out and have fun, they will get distracted and end up procrastinating on their work and get behind. Today, it's hard to trust students for them to do something on their own because they wont do it or will probably lie about it to get out of doing. This is why they need to be supervised all the time and to make sure they do the work. It will be better for the student attend school in person than doing online school.

About every kid in America goes to school five days a week to get the education that they need. And the students that do online school aren't getting the education they need. Students have the freedom to go to school for free and get the proper education they need. Students can go to school and be able to get the same learning experience as everyone else and be able to interact with people face to face and this helps because its helping them prepare for the future and its better than sitting at home and learning everyday and not being able to talk to people face to face. It's important that students get the proper education they need because they are the future of this world and sitting at home and learning isn't a good option. The students that learn from have it easy because they can access notes and cheat on assignments and test without being caught.

Cheating is very bad and can get you in a lot of trouble and if caught cheating, there can be consequences to that but, if caught cheating while taking online classes there will be no discipline and the online school wont know about it and would be able to tell of the student cheated or not on the assignment or test. Students that cheat will not help them or isnt teaching them anything. Students that do online school think they have it easy because they can cheat on anything at anytime. When they are doing an assignment or test, a parent should in the room at all times and not the teacher they are communicating online because they won't know about it. Kids are pretty sneaky and secretive about everything now so be careful and watch your children when taking online classes or send them to school where they can get the education they need and talk to people face to face.

There's only a few good things about online school like, students that aren't physically able to attend school, they have the option of online school and same goes for the people that can't go to school because they have a long term illness, injury, or a disability. Ever since technology has been out, it keeps getting better and better and now some now online school has become a thing. One thing that its good about it is we can use computers at school and learn and make it more fun. Also, it can prepare us for the future because technology is everywhere. The only time online school is allowed is people that cant physically go to school and they must have permission to take online school also.

Could us people see a increase in online school; yes but not for a good reason. This is another reason why Americans are lazy because they dont want to be around people and they try to get out of every little situation as possible and have it easy. Lastly, Online school cost money and you have the option to attend a public school for free and get the proper education you need to prepare for the future. There are plenty of options for school now and think about what is good for you.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is not teacher help, and cheater.

To begin with, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is no teacher help. For example, Generic_Name is doing his work online and there is something that he not understand, he will need the teacher help,or the teacher explication on how to do it, all students need some times help for the teacher. In conclusion, students have to attend classes from school because the teachers can bring their helps for anything you not understand.

5B3B6284CCEC,"Schools that provide distant learning has a negative effect on students Which they cannot benefit from home schools. Students will not be able to benefit from this because students needs to be in a classroom setting. In a class room settings students will be able to stay focus on there work as well as completing Class work on time, teachers will be able to provide help with class work or any missing assignments, and Students will be able to communicate with other students and complete various class work or activites.

First, students will stay focused in a classroom setting because there is less distractions and the teacher will keep them on tasks with there school work. Being home will cause more distraction for the student because they will be on there phone more often, watching TV, or talking to a family member which the student can't focus. Also students are able to interact and answer questions and ask questions as a whole class. Lastly students will be able to complete class work on time and to participate in class activities.

Next, teachers will be able to provide one on one help if needed. Furthermore, Teachers can also except late work and give out extra credit work to help boost the students grades up. also teachers can break down the notes and answer in any questions you have during class. Lastly teachers provide after school tutoring to help any student catch up on late work or help with work that the student doesn't Understand.

Lastly,Students will be able to communicate with other students and complete various class work or activites.

Being at home and taking online classes isn't healthy for the student being home and not being able to communicate with other students in there age group will make even harder for them to succeed in being home school. Also students can also benefit from being around other students because they can work with each other as a group and also complete tasks together so they can finish quickly.

However, Schools that provides distant learning as an option students will not benefit from this. student will benefit from being in classroom with other students in there age. The reason are that students will stay focused in a classroom setting, teachers can provide help in the classroom and answer any questions for you, and they can communicate with other students to complete class work and activities.                                                               ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1E1A489F2DC6,"Image being able to wake up from bed and attend class from your house. Students wouldn't have to wake up hours/minutes earlier to catch their bus. Although some people say that students should go to school to attend class, actually students should be able to attend class from their home.

Those who say students should attend class at school believe that Students won't get distracted as much as they would at home because they have teachers that will always be on them if they do. Teachers have many ways to get the attention of a student. For example, teachers can move the distracted student to the front of the class so that he/she can focus more. They can also threaten to call the students parents so that student focuses.

However, Students would pay more attention to class at home because they don't have other students to distract them during class.

You wouldn't have to listen to side chattering from other students while the teacher is talking. When your alone you focus and listen more. For example, If a student and their teacher have a video conference there won't be noise to distract the student, but if there are other students in the video conference then you can possibly mute them if they're talking.

Another reason being that students cannot be late to their class because technically the class is at their home. Students can't make excuses to being late. All they have to do is wake up and log onto their computers to see what their doing for class. For example, students can't make the excuse that they missed the bus because there is no bus. Students Can also check in from their bed, bathroom, kitchen, living room, etc.

Also, being able to study from home gives students the benefit to sleep a bit more. Students wouldn't have to wake up earlier before school to change, to eat, to shower, or to get their bag ready. Students can do most the things they do before school that take up their sleep at home if they were able to have class from their homes. For example, students can eat their breakfast while they listen to their teacher on a video conference. They can also wear whatever they slept with since there aren't other students to impress.

Therefore being able to attend class from home rather than attend class at school benefits students more. Since it's hard to be late to class students can have better attendance. Also With more sleep the brain of the student will function better and they'll be less tired. Also with no distractions means that Students will focus more and better. These reasons explain how students can achieve more if they were allowed to attend class from their homes.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4E5902274F7A,"Parents always want to make the best decisions for their kids, whether it is homeschooling them or enrolling them into an actual school. Many students would rather be enrolled into a school than to be sitting at home all day video calling a teacher. Attending classes at home would not benefit students because they would lack social skills, less help, along with not fulfilling certain academic skills.

One of the biggest parts of taking classes at school are meeting new people and making connections with people. Bonding with friends and teachers can make a big impact on a students life, and not having the ability to do that can make a difference. Without social skills even the smallest tasks, like asking for help or greeting someone, could be nerve racking or difficult. During school I have needed to ask teachers or friends so many questions, because I did not understand the unit. The ability for me to ask peers and adults for help is a great gift that I greatly appreciate in my life. Social skills have helped me in so many situations that I could not have done myself if I were to take classes from home.

Attending classes from home may be less stressful on students because of less distractions and less people, but there is very little to no extra help. Taking classes at home is only the student and the teacher on a singular call. There are not nearly enough sources to obtain help from when taking classes at home. Whenever I am in need of help I would ask my friends or ask the teacher and they would give me an abundance amount of sources for help on whatever I am struggling on. When home schooled it is different and there is limited amount of help provided. Everyone deserves the help they desire for classes and that is a benefit of kids going to school for learning instead of home.

Taking part in school is an experience that everyone should go though and grow from. School develops so many academic skill sets that students learning from home would never have. Not having these academic skills could hurt the students learning from home. In schools they all have certain rules to follow with how to learn and act around others. At home they may be completely different. Once they enter the world outside their house it may be hard on the students because it is entirely different. When I had advanced from middle school to high school I thought it was a hard enough transition. I cannot imagine going from home schooled into the real world. The academic skills at schools need to be brought upon the students learning at home so they can understand what everyone else does.

The benefits students would have learning at school over at home is not even a question. Schools provide so much in many more ways than home. Schools provide students with better social skills, academic skills, and more help towards students who are in need of it. Home schooling students may not be a bad decision for some kids, because of certain situations, like disabilities and mental health, but most schools have programs and certain teachers who are more than willing to help those students learn and expand more. Overall learning and taking classes in school is a much better decision than at home.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
03FDC60BE33B,"Four out of five students prefer taking classes online. In last five years more than three-thousands students graduated from taking the classes online. Additionally, students will benefit taking classes online because, they will learn in a peaceful environment, getting online computer experience, and responsibilities of doing the work independently.

Working alone and independent makes you memorize the lessons so fast. Students who work independent gets the highest score.

77AD6EF55B2C,"For decades school has been taught by having to physically go to classrooms and learn there, but now there's another option, distance learning. Whether it be online schooling or video chatting with teachers, distance learning is growing to be more popular. It may be argued whether or not distance learning is a good thing, and the short answer to that is that it is. Distance learning benefits students to be able to be in their own houses while still attending class. It'd be less expensive, better for their mental health, and overall, less time consuming for students.

Traditionally, going to college or to a private school in years K-12 means having to live on campus, but with distance learning you can live at home, and save money. That already makes distance learning less expensive. Since students won't have to live on campus to attend classes at the institution of their choice they won't have to pay an extensive amount of money for a dorm. For example, students with out financial aid could be paying anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand dollars a year to attend the school that they want to go to, and for some, the tuition is even more expensive if the institution they attend is very far from where they live. Even if a majority of students have financial aid, it doesn't cover all the expenses that come with living on campus. If students know they can't live up to paying all the loans they have, distance learning will help them a lot. Students can still achieve their goals since money would not be the biggest drawback anymore. They'll be able to learn from teachers that work in the institution of their choice while saving money.

Now, as well as students saving money, students can better their mental health. Across the country, students physically having to go to school can be mentally draining . I myself and many of my friends experience big amounts of stress having to wake up at five thirty in the morning having fallen asleep at midnight. Some may argue by saying to go to sleep early, but many people work, and go to school while still having homework. Most of the time, students work out of necessity to make more money to be able to support themselves or their families, so they can't just quit their jobs. With distance learning, students can choose a more accommodating schedule to do school so they can get an adequate amount of sleep to work and do school and any assignments they may have. People who suffer with social anxiety or anxiety in general can also better their mental health with distance learning. Students won't have to be surrounded by dozens of people at a time and can have the comfort of being at home, while still learning and trying to better their anxiety. If students were to go to school without a good mental health, they would not do so well in school. From personal experience and friends experiences, if our mental health isn't good, we tend to do bad in school that day. In some cases, a students mental health can be so bad that they can't bring themselves to go to school everyday. Therefore, instead of a student falling behind, they can do distance learning while they bring themselves up again.

Furthermore, distance learning is less time consuming. For anyone who wants school to be less time consuming, distance learning is perfect and can benefit them. The student can choose the time and day they do school. Students can also pace themselves to finish school for the day faster instead of being in a classroom and having to wait for the bell to ring. If the student is done with all their work for the day, then they're done, there is no waiting. This also benefits people with a busy schedule since they also choose the time and day of their classes, as stated before. Instead of having to fit everything else according to school, they can fit in school according to anything else going on. For example, someone may work in the mornings and have to do school at night, or have it be the other way around. Whatever the case may be, the people get to choose when and how they'll do school. As well as choosing the day and time, students won't have to commute to school. They'll save time from being stuck in traffic since they'll be learning at home. Whether it be thirty minutes or many hours of time saved because of distance learning, it benefits students either way.

Having distance learning can change many students lives. It'll make many of their lives so much easier and way more manageable. Being able to save money and have a better mental health, and being able to save time everyday can solve many problems that prevent people from learning. No person should be held back from learning when a simple solution like distance learning exists. Having it offered worldwide would definitely benefit thousands.              ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
BD82629E71E2,"If some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. By a way of online or video conferencing the student would benefit.

The first reason is the student can focus because in school there are many distraction. For example you got students taking while the teacher is taking and that takes time away from the students learning. Also the student might not get their work done because he or she was taking to someone which can lead to horrible grades and a awkward relationship with the teacher. But if the student were to do online school there are less distractions and with less distractions the student can get their work done witch can lead to excellent grades.

The second reason is students can be themselves because in school if you don't fit in the student is an outcast. Therefor can lead to depression and suicidal thought also if students dont keep up with the latest trends they are made fun of. Because they dont have $200 dollar shoes or designer cloths but if a student was homed schooled they wont have try to impress someone or a groups of people. The student can just be themselves and they wont be made fun of their cloths because they are homed schooled.

The last reason is bullying most schools have some type of bullying. Student that get bulled are more focused on the bully then school witch can lead to bad grades, depression, and suicide. Also students don't want to go to school because of bullying and students don't look for help because they are scared of what people might say. Therefor if a student was homed schooled they wont worry about bullying.

Also people might say that the student needs to go to school to make friends. Those people are wrong because there are many ways to make friends like joining a sport team or making online friends.

I have been sick and had to miss school many times in my life. If something like distance learning was avalable to me I could have miss no work. This would reduce my stress level and would do the same for many students. For students who get sick a lot this could help them catch up easly and not be as stressed. Students who get sick a lot are not the only once who would get to benifet from distance learning.

Disabled students would also greatly benifet from distance learning. For many disabled students it can be hard to even get to school. Many disabled people have a much harder time than the rest of us, but if something like distance learing was avalable they could go to class from there beds or homes. This would be a huge waight off there sholders if they could do school from home. Disabled people and people who get sick a lot are no the only once distance learning can help it can also help students who go on vacation.

When people go on vacation they usally want to say clear of things like school, but once they get back and have a pile of work to do they will not enjoy it at all. Distance learning can releve the stress they will most defantly will feel after there vacation. Students can still enjoy there vacation while doing some work. All in all distance learning is a great thing for students, but some claim it is a bad thing and should be left alone.

many people don't like the idea of distance learning. these people are wrong in saying that, They claim that if a student is sick they should rest. this point is invaled because if distent learming were a thing they would be able to do it at there own past. they might also say that if a student is on vacation they are having a brake and should be left alone. this is also incorrect if they wanted to go on vacation and take a brake they should have gone during one of the built in brakes the school provides.

Distance learning should defanatly be provided to students. It should be provided for disabled students with limmited mobilaty. Distance learning should be there for students who get sick regularly. There should be distance learning for students who go on vacation. When you really think about it, distance learning has no cons only pros and should be put in place as soon as possible.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EC6E2D618E20,"I do not believe that distance learning would benefit students. the reason for this is that there are too many distractions that students face today, such as, cellphones, television, and just the internet as a whole.

Cellphones are a major distraction due to the fact that they can be taken and used anywhere. due to this students are easily distracted. Cellphones also can recieve call and texts at any time.

T.V. is a distraction because students can have a conference open and not pay attention to it. Because of so many shows and specials taking place at all times, it may be hard to work in a conferes between shows. The internet is a major distraction because in an online conference someone can easily open up a new tab and do whatever they want not learn anything.

These are the reasons why i think distance learning wouldn't be beneficial to students. With so many distractions and the immatureness of students i think it would be better to have a student learn in person.   ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
E2FCB022655C,"Must be nice to stay at home all day instead of waking up early in the morning to get ready to go school, right?

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing. Some individuals may believe that this may benefit students more than attending a traditional schools, while others disagree with this issue. I do not think students would benefit from online classes from home because it takes away one on one learning opportunities, it is easier to get distracted at home, and it takes away from unique experiences.

Taking courses online rather than sitting in a classroom with a teacher takes away one on one learning opportunities. It is more likely that a scholar would learn more from listening and speaking with a teacher than completing tasks and assignments online. Students who attend a traditional school get the benefit of working with a teacher individually, aside from scheduled classes. They also have the choice of coming in before school or after school to get extra help from a teacher individually.

Students who are learning from home have more distractions around them. When an individual is trying to be successful with completing work, that is more likely to be done in a working environment rather than a bed with a TV right across. There are many more distractions at home than there are in school, making it harder to focus and allowing the student to be less motivated to do work. This could lead to students falling behind. In a classroom setting, students are able to learn to keep up with their work and become more organized.

Being home schooled takes away experiences that you can only experience in traditional schools. These unique experiences make great memories which last a lifetime. Fun and exciting events like school dances, sporting events, pep rallies, and spirit weeks can only be experienced at traditional schools. Students who take classes from home will miss out on these iconic traditions that most students will get the opportunity to experience. School is not only about how well you are doing academically, but also how much you are engaged socially.

Students who are home schooled have a lot of disadvantages compared to students who are not. They miss out on one on one learning, there are many more distractions at home, and they don't get to live through the amazing experiences at school. Some may argue that online school may be more beneficial for students who prefer to go at their own pace or don't have enough time in the day to attend eight hours of school. In the real world, however, people who are able to keep up with faster paced settings are more likely to get hired than someone who is not, as well as someone who is available more often than someone who is not. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
861588AA9001,"As a teenager I had always struggled with school, whether it be because of projects, tests, or even socializing with my own peers. The pressure had taken a toll on my mental health and caused me to slack off in my classes. Once I started online school, everything changed for me. I started getting better grades in classes, I became happier overall, and I was getting lots one on one help from teachers, which benefited me a lot when learning new things. Students will benefit from online school, because it will reduce stress and anxiety, it will allow students to go at their own pace, and it gives students a better chance to get help with teachers.

Young adolescents feel pressured by their peers to fit in at school. This causes anxiety and stress to begin at such a young age. Before I started online school, my anxiety felt like it would never go away. At school, I felt nervous and stressed all the time. People would gossip in the hallways, libraries, and even in the restrooms. It was such a scary thing to see, and I never wanted to be a part of it. In public school people cared more about each others business than their own education. With online school, students can still communicate with their peers and still remain on topic at the same time. This allows for students to get the help they need from eachother without having the fear of being judged or getting made fun of. Without the fear of communicating, it is so much easier to get work done.

Many students, especially in their high school years, feel stressed by the amount of work they are expected to do in such a short time. This causes loads of stress and it doesn't allow students to submit work they really enjoy. With online school, students are given all their assignments before hand, and they can go at their own pace to finish their work by the end of the quarter. This way students dont feel piled with work, and they can enjoy doing the work they are given. In the T.V. show ""That 70's Show"" Eric Forman was given an assignment to do, which he only had 2 days to finish. He had such a difficult time, it caused him to fall behind in other classes as well. Many students in school express how they feel about due dates, but sadly much can't be done by the teachers to change it.

People could argue and say that students won't benefit from online school because they wont be able to get any in class experience, but they are ill informed. Students are able to video chat and message with their own teachers. In classes such as science, students can watch their teachers do labs live, and they are able to communicate with eachother. Students are able to message and video chat with their teachers throughout the entire day, whereas in regular school, many students are only given the privilege of emailing their teachers for help.

Online school is a privilege, that sadly many people can not experience due to not having the resources in their schools area. In the upcoming years, many more schools will become more technological, allowing for online school to become a regular form of education. Not everyone may be a fan, but that is because they haven't had the luck of trying it out themselves. With easier access to teachers, the decrease of stress, and being able to turn in assignments whenever, Students will definitely see a benefit in online school as well as an increase in their mental health.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7503F2114244,"Distance learning classes will benefit many students. Online classes provide a better environment, kids have more freedom, and these at home classes will help them focus more.

Allowing students to have classes at home benefits them in a positive way because it allows room for a better environment. In many schools kids are constantly being bullied, taunted, or mistreated. This form of learning, either online or through video conference, happens in the sanctuary of your home and stops this mistreatment from happening. For example, if a kid in class wasn't wearing the newest ""in trend"" clothes, that kid is at a high risk of being bullied by fellow classmates. Kids have a major effect on each other and can be easily bullied or manipulated by any person throughout the school, even some teachers can take part in this too. Learning at home is a safe and warm environment where a child can really feel safe and secure which can benefit them in a great way.

Distance learning courses for students gives them freedom. In school you are never capable of doing anything, you always have to ask or be told, and can never do what you want. Teachers say no, faculty constantly tells you what to do, and even some older students think they have authority over you. Imagine being at school and asking to use the bathroom and a teacher says no without a valid reason. Being at home can create freedom for the child and they can go freely as they please. A child can go to the bathroom whenever they feel the need, they can get something to eat, or even just relax for a few minutes and take a break. At home courses cause children to still be able to fully learn and not be overly controlled to the point where there's no freedom.

Lastly, by having these online courses students are able to really focus on their schooling. As a kid, being in school is a major distraction. You have friends constantly distracting you, drama always going on, and so many other things that can cause you to lose focus. Being at home makes creates little to no room for distractions. A student can easily find a nice quiet place in their home to have their online class or video conference. Having a quiet place or even somewhere with less chaos around you has many benefits. One of which is a students true focus on the class, they can easily get their work done faster because there are no distractions. School is such an important thing in your life and it deserves a students full undivided attention so they can succeed.

Some people may say that by having your kid take classes at home can deprive them of having social contact. Having these classes doesn't mean that the student can't go out, they can easily get involved in extra curricular activities and make new friends. School isn't about being social its about getting your education so you can succeed. In conclusion, having in home classes by distance learning benefits students in a great way. Being at home gives kids a better learning environment, they have more freedom versus being in school, and it can allow them to focus on what is important.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5BF438587881,"While most students go to public school, it isn't the most beneficial option. Students now have the option to homeschool and or online school. I believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because home schooling allows students to learn on their own, learn at your own pace, and home schooling can be socailly beneficial. Some people may see home schooling and online schooling as different, but some students believe this type of learning is easier for them.

Home schooling allows students to learn on their own by allowing them to understand the course completely before taking an end of course test. Teachers in public schools sometime, do not help the student learn fully because they have over a hundred kids to teach the same thing to. Working on your own lets students take their time and understand the content better, without the rush of knowing that subject so quickly. This helps students out in the long run, especially on important tests.

Online and home schooling is also socially beneficial. As a public school student, our social life can become more important than school work. As a home schooler, students do not waste their time getting involved in bad decisions. Staying out of those bad decisions allows students to get farther in life and gain new oppurtunities. For example, one of my friends graduated a year earlier because she had enough credits from online schooling, to finish high school faster. If students would rather get their classes done faster, home schooling and or online school is the way to do it.

Lastly, home schooling offers students to learn at their own pace. Learning at your own pace is another way to fully understand what you're learning. The rush of public school also sets back students from being great. Teachers expect students to learn new content and understand it within a few weeks. Online schooling is the opposite, students take their time and can also get ahead of the students in public school. For example, my friend i mentioned previously was so much smarter and understands a lot more because she took her time on her work.

In conclusion, I believe home schooling and online schooling can benefit a student more than public school. Learning is hard enough as it is and if students are able to learn at their own pace, learn on their own, and have social benefits wouldn't that make life easier? For example my mom always says, learn smarter not harder. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
455F9695FAAF,"Would you feel prepared for your future if you learned your classes at home electronically? With technology constantly improving, distance learning is becoming popular among individuals who would like to learn while being in the comfort of their own home.

While distance learning may be convenient for the student, students are not receiving the full school experience they would otherwise go through.

When a student physically goes to school, they are able to expand their social skills, have a more personal learning experience and are able to prepare for their future more.

By attending school physically, students are able to enhance their communication abilities with other people.

Moreover, when I look back at my years throughout school, I realize how much my ability to make friends has improved.

Had I not attended school, I would surely not have as many friends as I do now.

If a student were to attend school electronically at home, they would not possess the skills needed to socialize with others.

This demonstrates the importance of attending school physically.

Additionally, when talking to one of my friends who had previously done distance learning, he told me that it was difficult for him to make friends because his communicative skills were not on par with other people his age.

Due to the fact that my friend participated in distance learning, he was not able to develop those core skills that we take for granted.

This is why it is essential that individuals try their best to attend school physically as opposed to learning from a distance.

A more personal learning experience is gained when a student goes to school.

Furthermore, whenever I go to school, I feel that learning is more interactive.

Due to learning being interactive when I attend school, learning in school offers a special experience that proves to be incredibly effective towards a student's capability to learn.

In addition, when talking with my sister, she says that she is able to learn better due to the teachers being there physically.

When one chooses the route of distance learning, they will not be receiving that special learning experience that would help them learn better.

When one chooses to attend school, they are able to prepare for their futures more so than if they were to learn via distance learning.

Thus, I feel more prepared than ever for my journey to college as my school is able to provide the resources for learning about the numerous paths students can take once they graduate.

Distance learning would not be able to sufficiently prepare students for the near future, which could lead to confusion once that particular student graduates.

Lastly, my friend who participated in distance learning found it difficult to find out what he wanted to do after he graduated.

Distance learning creates unpreparedness within students which can negatively affect an individual's future.

Overall, distance learning does not provide the sufficient experience that is vital for a student.

By attending school physically, students are able to interact with other people better.

Students are also able to learn more efficiently, due to the physical presence of the teacher.

Finally, students are able to discover who they would like to be when they get out of high school.

After all, we want to create futures, not ruin them.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
6081F7294031,"In the past few years, most of the schools began to offer an online courses for the students instead of having them go to school. In fact, online courses had became commonly preferred by most of the students. Students will not benefit from those online courses because they lack the academic atmosphere that most of the students used to, they prevent the student from communicating with other people in order to have new friends, and they make the student able to cheat on his courses because of the availability of his electronic devises without any strict rules.

Students who attend online courses will learn at their houses without having to go to school. Their houses isn't the best place to learn because of the availability of all kind interruption for the student. Student will not be able to concentrate and focus on his course. The house lacks the academic environment that every student must have; Although some people might say that the student can benefit from the online course by getting any type of support by a family member throughout the course, in fact the family can affect the student negatively more the positively by interrupting him while he is taking the course.

The online courses also prevent the student from having a better communication with other people or from making new friends. Good communication is one of the most important skills that every student should have. School provides the best communication environment for the student because it gathers couple of students in one room and sometimes teachers require the students to work in a small group which give the student a better chance to comprehend during the class, and make new friends at the same time.

Finally, Online courses don't have enough engagement with the student; Therefore, the student will have the opportunity to cheat throughout his online courses. Most of the schools have their own rules and conditions about cheating and using the electronic devices during the class; But the student will definitely have all kind of electronic devices at home that can help him to get an information that he's not supposed to get during his online course without having anyone to stop him.

Although online courses can be beneficial from some student. But they lack the simplest need of any student. Online courses don't provide the academic and learning atmosphere for the students, they prevent the students from a great opportunity to develop their communication skills and make new friends, the students also will be able to cheat through out their online courses because of the lack of the engagement.   ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
73E0F93F113B,"Doing school classes at home would be nice but it would not be successful for everyone. Majority of students in schools are more hands on learners; even though having that extra hour or two of sleep sounds very pleasant. people need to be motivated and if assistance is needed, someone is there. Students would not benefit from distance learning classes because of the lack of motivation and of how the vast majority of students learn.

First reason, is that a big percentage of the students in schools are hands on learners. Reading, listening and watching videos on a computer are just a small portion of how the mind works. Physically doing the work helps a students brain process about what is being taught, and take in the material quicker. which helps motivate students to try to go above and beyond.

Secondly, Students need to be motivated to want to get good grades. say a student is not staying focus and is failing a class and a peer in that same class always brags about getting better grades than the other student. It would push the student to do better. Having others in the same room can be soothing; to know that if someone is having difficulties understanding what is being taught, there are other around who understand can help.

Some may say, doing online classes would be beneficial for students who have families and other work priorities to take care of. It would also be helpful to students who have trouble focusing in classrooms. However, being in a classroom environment can put students mind at ease, knowing there are others around who understand, and are going through the same thing. Doing classes this way would help teach each other to stay focus and keep one another in place.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Due to the lack of motivation. No work would get done. Being able to stay focus would be a struggle for most people, because of being at home in a comfortable environment. Also, because the vast majority of students in school are hands on learners. Students would not benefit from learning classes from home.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
E59DD4FF67E8,"Having students take classes from home could work out very well, but also at the same time be very defective to the student, simple as becoming less motivated to do stuff as in sports and extra after school activities, I would love to take my classes from my home being that i wouldn't have to raise my hand for things, ask to go to the bathroom, or let along ask borrow something. I also feel that students would get in less trouble if they were to take classes from home, therefore theres less of a chance of students getting into fights with others and less of a chance of students showing up late to class. Being in the comfort of your home while working on class assignments is what most students would want instead of being cramped up at school with other students.

There are mostly flaws with this idea, consequently students wouldnt always be focused on what there really suppose to be doing, I wouldnt really understand or know how it would work or how it would process therefore i couldnt say that all students would even attend the class since there is no school to go to. I think a majority of the students would be lazy and like i said less motivated to get up and do stuff because school isnt just a place where you get your education its also a place where you learn how to become a young adult and being at home everyday taking online classes would not teach any of the skills of being a young adult.

In fact taking the online classes instead of going to school could be challenging for most because some students may not have the basic requirements to get on to the online course as in a computer/device and internet overall if it came down to having to take online classes or just go to school id rather take the online classes, speaking for my self i know that i have the requirements to take online classes others may disagree.

For the parents that are involved it would probably be a hassle for them as well and what i mean by that is they would have to be the ones to register you into your online classes and plus some parents may not trust there kids home alone while there at work, I cant say that all parents would have a problem with it in fact some parents might love it because it saves them the trip of having to come down to the school when something bad happens let along helps parents that take there kids to school, therefore it helps them on their time management.

C9476E86A834,"Certain school districts offer online classes and video conferences as a way to complete high school. Although various students have disabilities or individualized circumstances which require them to partake in school activities from home, the average student would not benefit from completing school at home because students would sacrifice vital social interactions, students would not be adequately equipped for the workplace, and students would ultimately be excluded from a traditional high school experience. For most students, school is better experienced in a physical building where students will be able to receive more than simply an education. Students in physical schools also receive specialized components which will assist them through various aspects of their lives.

To begin with, students participating in strictly online courses are excluded from the privilege of interacting with their peers on a daily basis. The bonds students form with other classmates are enforced by daily conversing. Students enrolled in online school are isolating themselves and depriving themselves of the opportunity to be surrounded with youths in similar age groups and similar ways of self expression. Isolation and loneliness can easily lead to depression if a student is susceptible to such mental illnesses. Students who find themselves lacking social interactions can possess low self esteem because they are not receiving validation from people they respect. The most obvious effect of isolation is simply boredom, for a student spending no time with other students is guaranteed to experience a harsh level of loneliness.

Moreover, students enrolled in online school are not being prepared for a professional environment in the same level as students in public or private school. In physical schools, students are subjected to various tasks and situations which mimic those in the workplace. Students completing schooling from home will not experience situations such as collaborations or presentations. Collaborating with people that possess conflicting skill sets and opinions is an ability students should be exposed to from a young age so they are better equipped to deal with it in their occupations. Oral presentation skills should also begin developing at a young age to improve public speaking and anxiety affiliated with public speaking as an adult. Students in online school also lack motivation given from other students. Encouragement from peers is an uplifting strategy to gain motivation and complete a task to the best of one's ability.

Additionally, youths completing school from home are missing out on a classic high school experience. The high school experience can be regarded in many different ways depending on the person in question. A majority of adults would describe it as basic element of a semi privileged life. Although different people experience negative and positive emotions throughout the duration of high school, a plethora of individuals create lasting memories and cherish their traditional high school years. Impacting events during high school include finding a passion, attending school sponsored events, and joining a club or sport. School is essential in shaping a person's interests because it allows people to find other people with common interests. Students in public and private schools are more likely to discover their hidden preferences because they are generally encouraged to do so by the administration and staff.

In conclusion, students will not benefit from participating in school strictly online or through online video conferences because they are sacrificing any potential advancement in social skills, they are not as likely to succeed in a traditional occupation, and they are not given a genuine high school experience. If able students do not attend public school, their overall success will be diminished. It is imperative that the majority of students complete their education in a physical environment. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
891C3503DD33,"I believe that students can benefit from attending classes at home. Many students have a safer learning environment when learning at home than at schools. Since majority of students have access to the internet and have computers at home, connecting to online classes wouldn't be an issue. Most students have a hard time waking up early in the morning; if they were to take online classes, students would be able to get more sleep and be able to focus easier. Students can benefit from online learning because they have a more comfortable learning environment and a less stressful schedule.

My first reason to why students would benefit from online classes, is that they have a more comfortable environment. Students can work in their pajamas while doing online assignments, however, if they are in a video conference with a teacher, they must be dressed somewhat appropriate. Being at home can help students be more focused on their work and do much better on assignments. Students will avoid distracting classmates and getting in trouble with their friends when at home. For example, whenever students see their friends, they immediately want to talk and joke around with them, which could lead to them getting in trouble with the teacher. Unfortunately, some students have to deal with classmates that bullies and discourages them, but they wouldn't have to deal with them if they are at home. If students took classes online at home, all these reasons could improve a student's education.

My second reason why students could improve their education through online classes is that they would have a less stressful schedule. Most students like to sleep in, but as long as they complete their assignments the same day, students can sleep for as long as they want. For example, students who attend schools have to a wake up from around 5am to 6am to be on time for school; while students who take online classes can wake up on their own time. Since students don't have to arrive at school; they do not have to worry about missing the bus or be ready when someone to comes pick them up. Most importantly, students may eat meals and snacks whenever they would like and not have to follow their school's lunch schedule. However, students must make sure their computer is charged so they can complete their all assignments.

In conclusion, there are many positive outcomes from attending classes at home than at school. It can be easier for students to focus, they don't have to worry about other students, they can work in pajamas, students can wake up later on, students don't have to worry about missing the bus, and students may eat whenever they like. All of these reasons help prove that students may receive greater benefits from online classes at home.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
7C8E247A89E8,"Distant learning gives students the ability to learn from home. Sometimes students can not properly work at school because of bullies or issues with their family.

With the availability of technology, there are so many options regarding homework and even full classes. High school and even middle school students who switch to distant learning, home bound, have less chances of graduating and they are not able to grow at the means of their peers. Distant learning will not benefit students because they have less social interaction, no attendance requirements, no foundational structure.

Students going home bound for school does not allow them to have the social interaction they would in a classroom setting with the teachers and other students. On average, class sizes have grown to around 25 to 30 students. If a student has seven classes a day, then they will possibly be interacting with 200 or more students. Being in classes with other students the same age allows children and young adults to compare things in their lives together and even help each other succeed in that subject. On the other hand, it is beneficial for students to have interaction with their instructors. Physically being in a classroom with their teachers allows for an immediate response to any questions or confusion that might be had. This also allows the students and teachers to get to know each other on a more personal level and build stronger relationships. Just watching lecture videos does not meet the need for human interaction to learn and grow.

Everyone says things like, ""I will do it later."" or ""I do not need to worry about doing that."" Highschool students who do all of their schooling from home might continuously say these things and eventually stop doing their work. If someone has no responsibility of having to physically be at school, they are going to do what they want to do in all of their free time; therefore the online school work does not get done. Students like to make excuses as to why their homework did not get completed, but a student on home bound could simply say their internet went out or their computer is not working and easily get out of doing their assignments. Since there is no way to prove attendance, there is no specific place a student on home bound has to be at any particular time, which allows them to possibly get into trouble with their parents or even the law. Students physically going to school have to be accounted for and if too much time is missed, then action is taken by the school board and law enforcement.

Distant learning does not allow for appropriate attendance and leads to school work being incomplete. By not doing the work, nothing is learned and students are uneducated.

The students doing all of their classes online have no foundational structure built into their lives. Students at a young age develop skills and structure by going to school. They have to adjust to being around so many other kids the same age. For example, gym class. Every student had to learn how to dress out in a timely fashion and get used to exercising regularly in front of other people. Students can not learn these basic skills through a computer.

Home bound learning is all done online, but a student can not take physical fitness online. They can not take track or football online. Also without some form of structure, students do not learn time management like they would by having to get up and go to school on time or participating in school activities. If someone had to get up early to catch the bus, go to class, then go to practice after school, they have been set up to be an adult in a career field with a full schedule. Students doing distant learning do not learn those skills and become put at a disadvantage for their future.

On the other hand, online classes benefit those who are mature enough to handle themselves, such as adults and those paying for college classes. Highschool students are not developed enough to be set free to do work assigned on their own time. There are some students that academically care and would take their work seriously, but a vast majority would not. In college, students are paying to have top of the line teaching to further their knowledge in a specific field to eventually gain a career in. Additionally, adults who want to earn higher degrees but do not have time to sit in a classroom benefit from distant learning classes because they can do them when they have time. Those students also have a choice and that allows them to fit their classes in with their needs. High school students have to take the classes required by their state, so they should stay in the classroom setting until they have the ability to choose their career path in college.

Distant learning is not beneficial to students in higschool or younger on a normal basis. If all students turn to this method of learning, the next generations will be under prepared for the ""real world."" School needs to be a main factor in building young lives and pushing them to be the most successful they can be. Because of the immaturity and lack of control, younger students should not be able to have this option. Students need social interaction, physical attendance, and a foundational structure in their live, but distance learning does not give them that.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

One of my reasons why I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that they would save a whole lot of time. Unlike me, I have to get up at 6:30 sharp because I need to catch the bus on time, eat my breakfast and simply need to get ready for school. That is time consuming and doing that repeatingly can cause stress. We simply do not want any stress right? Due to the difference in timing, attendence would play a big factor to your school life. If you apply for colleges, they wouldn't know about your attendance. think about it.

Another reason why I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is that you would be home! There are many times I'd feel so uncomfortable being in school. My friend, who is homeschooled, said to me ""being homeschooled is better than being at school and having that same routine everyday."" I feel like without being in the state of uncomfortableness you can operate and concentrate a whole lot more. You can gain more knowledge and that could lead better understanding to the topic.

Some people would say physically being in the class is better because you won't get the same experience a being in a classroom. I SAY NO TO THAT. Being in a class full of people you might not know is awkard and sometimes nerve racking. There are so many things going on in such a small classroom for example; people yelling, interupting the class and even in worse scenarios those ""class clowns."" You wouldn't be in a quiet enviorment and that could lead you to unproductivity. I just dont think that's worth it.

In conclusion, I do think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. People might say other things. But I don't think it's right that students should suffer from being at school. I sure do know a lot of people who do including me. You can save a whole lot of time and be way more productive than you would in your average class. School is important and should be like that always.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
8FF9315CDCAF,"What if you could go to school at home on you're own time. This is what some schools are doing using online classes or video conferencing. Although some say that this is beneficial to students other's say that this is a bad idea. Their are many reasons that this is a Good idea.

Many students at school attend on a regularly many are late every day to school and there held accountable. With online classes whos to say if your really there or not. This also can diminish social skills making good connections key for a future employment. Some students dont have access to computer or stable internet at home if they where sick or worse home bound and they could not receive there assessments they'd flunk out of school. My county offers computers and 4G hot spots to students but others are not so lucky.

While there are some downsides there are many more positive reasons that students should have the option to attend classes online. If a student is sick or otherwise unable to attend school they can still receive class time, without being suffocated with all the work that comes with missing a day or, even worse a week of school. If you haft to attend a function during school hours you end up missing class with little understanding of what is going on when you get back with online learning you can watch the class over again at different time and better help you under the class.

More than 70% of Americans live within ten miles of a school others are outside a school bus pickup zone and cant get to school on time or at all; this is a bigger problem in rural counties where if your parents cant drop you off or you cant drive yourself then you cant attend school. If you are old enough to stay at home alone than you can take online school.

In conclusion the pros out wight the cons with online distance learning. Will this learning option be viable in the future I sure hope so. It brings so many more learning options to the nation at litte cost to the tax payer. Now you know why you should suport online distance learning.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
2E1F288230F2,"Students would not benefit from being able to attend class from home because, students would not receive the same amount of help from the teacher as a student in class would, some students would not focus because there could be multiple distractions , and they would not finish their work on time, and students would not be able to work in group assignments, and not elaborate as well in group discussions.

When a student is attending a class from home, they may not receive the same amount of help because of how many students there are, it would take a while for each one to receive help. If a student attends a class online, it may take a long time for the teacher to respond to emails, discussion boards and get questions answered. A student who is in class can easily ask the teacher directly, and face to face if they have a question on a worksheet, an assignment, or on the lesson. The student attending the class online would have to wait to have their question answered and by the time the student has moved on, the teacher's response would not help the student and they would not benefit from it. When a student has a question on the lesson, the teacher may not understand the question fully in detail and answer it in a different way. This would not benefit the student because they may need to go out of their way to learn from another source and then be behind on their work.

Students that attend a class online would take it at home, when they are at home then there could be many distractions, and the student could procrastinate. If the student has more distractions in their learning environment then it can lead to the student not being able to learn and understand the topics the class is covering. This would not be beneficial for the student because if attended in class, the teacher could control the environment of the students and it the student could be more productive. Attending the class online could mean that the student is procrastinating the assignments, and turning them in late. If the work is turned in late, or they are not doing the work, all the work could pile up and become an issue for the student because they have the responsibility to complete them in a certain amount of time, and end up with a bad grade.

Classes in school have many assignments that involve group work and group discussions. When a student attends the class at home they have to do online discussions, but most of the time it is harder to elaborate in discussions online then it is in person. The student can lose communication skills and makes it harder to do group work online. If there is an assignment that has to be completed by a group, it would make it hard for the student who is not there to be part of a group and can affect their grade and really not be beneficial to the assignment. It is easier for the student to be there in person to help out as much as they can, when students do group work it is usually to expand their thinking and give each other ideas to use for the assignment. It is harder to give off ideas or receive ideas through an online class, it would benefit the student more if they are able to directly tell and help the other students face to face. It would benefit the student more to be in class at school to expand social, and communicating skills.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend class from home because, students would not receive the same amount of help from the teacher as a student in class would, some students would not focus because there could be multiple distractions at home, and procrastinate their work, and students would not be able to work in group assignments, and not elaborate as well in group discussions.                                                                       ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4F2CC610F271,"School is a sacred place for learning, making new friends and becoming more confident in yourself. Many students however, may not have the ability to be open and confident with situations in school. Having more availability to online classes can be a benefit for those students who struggle in one or more specific areas. As an anticipated result of online classes, students will find a way to be more comfortable in their academic studies. These classes will benefit all reserved, exhausted and visual learning students.

First of all, some students are very reserved and as a result they tend to be shy as well. Unfortunately, many other students have been bullied and stay to their selves. These events can lead to a student not being comfortable in their own skin, nor school. With a situation like this, online school would be a great option for these students. Not only can they gain comfort but they can be at peace with their academics and mentality.

In addition to, school starts early there's no doubt about that. With the early starting time, many students have a hard time getting their day started, driving their cars to school and may not have the time to stop and eat breakfast. This can cause students to become groggy and have a hard time focusing in school. With the virtual classes being available, students can work on their studies on their own time. Willingly, this will increase attention spans and students will be more studious.

Nevertheless, with the new era us students are more prone to learn easier on technology. I've had personal experience where taking an online English class was more comfortable than being in a classroom. Students are more likely to be visual learners. Having a computer to their face and being able to have their own visual of the work they are doing may become more helpful in the long run.

In argument, a good majority of students may not have internet access or even a computer. Libraries are convenient but not everyone might have time or access to a near by library. My community is lucky and grateful to have something open to everyone. Unfortunately, not many can say the same. In addition, students may face losing personal experiences as to school dances, meeting new people and having a face to face friendship.

In conclusion, online school can be a great benefit to students who need it or may just feel more comfortable with the virtual classes. With the online classes students can become more studious, comfortable and even increase in their academic studies. These virtual classes will be in style to the rising generations and become a great opportunity to students who want to prepare for the working world.                 ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
638546C1C924,"""I hate coming to school"" is something that I hear from my friends very often. Most teenagers go to a high school. Some find it very diffficult and are searching for an alternative. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Although some may believe otherwise, students would benefit from attending classes from home because school can be extremely stressful for students with poor mental health, and they give students more time for other things, such as jobs.

First of all, students with poor mental health would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online conferences because school can be extremely stressful for them. For example, my good friend Generic_Name, who was a student at Generic_School, started to have problems with her mental health and stopped attending her classes. She was able to take her courses online, which really helped her out. With the online courses taking away most of the stress from school, she was able to greatly improve her health, and she is doing much better now. Another example illustrating the benefits of allowing students to attend classes from home would be my friend Generic_Name, who also starting taking online courses instead of physically attending her classes because she started to have issues with her mental health as a result of anxiety and bullying. Attending online classes removed her from the bullying and allowed her to focus on improving her mental health. Since then, she has shown great improvement. Physically attending classes is not always to best option for some students.

Secondly, online courses would allow students who have to work to have more time to work. For example, when my older sister, Generic_Name, was a student at Generic_School, she had a job to support my family because my mom does not make a lot of money, and she did not always have enough time to get her schoolwork done. Quitting her job to focus only on school was not an option back then because the extra money that she made really helped our family with things, such as groceries. If she had taken online courses, the extra time would have allowed her to have a balance between work and school. Another example highlighting the importance of having more time as a result of taking online courses is my friend Generic_Name, who is currently in the same situation that my sister and my family were in. She works as a hostess at Carraba's, an Italian restaurant, so she can make money to help her family out. She is not always able to finish all of her homework on time, which has caused her grades to fall. She has talked to her counselor about online courses because she knows that she would have more time to work and complete schoolwork. Taking online courses would have had enormous benefits for both my sister and Generic_Name.

Others might argue that teenagers should be focused on doing well in school first, and not on other things, such as jobs, so they can get into good universities. While understandable, that logic is flawed due to the fact that it is still possible to get accepted into a good university even if students only took online courses. For example, my cousin Generic_Name, who completed online courses, was still able to get accepted into a university. It might have taken some time for her to adjust to being on a physical campus, but she is doing really well in college. Taking online courses did not affect her chances of getting accepted into college.

Allowing students to take online courses can be very beneficial to students. In the past, before schools offered online courses, students either had to keep attending school, even if they were suffering, or they would have no other choice but to drop out, which would prevent them from getting accepted into college and also from securing a well-paying job. In the future, as more schools start to allow their students to attend classes from home, students will see that they have more options, and it will not be so easy for them to flunk out. My call to action is for every high school to offer some online courses, so that students will have more alternatives to school and will be able to complete school with as little trouble as possible. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
6699DEA066F3,"There are schools that offer distance learning for students so that they can work in their homes on computers. Online learning can be beneficial to the student for health reasons or personal reasons; however, sometimes distance learning is not as beneficial as the classroom experience. There are many aspects of a physical classroom that online students will miss out on. Online classes can be simple for the student, but the simplicity of online learning is not enough for the education of the student. Even though online classes can make students feel comfortable with working on their own time, classroom instruction is more beneficial to students than online classes because it helps students gain social experience with their peers, helps students communicate easily with their teachers, and helps students remember lesson material better with physical experience.

Online learning can be beneficial to the student when it comes to students' individual schedules. There are students have jobs, have lots of homework, and have emergencies, so online classrooms can benefit these students because online learning can allow the student to work on their own pace. For example, if a student has a death in the family, the student should take time off from school to mourn and attend services. If that student missed classroom taught classes, the learning experience the student missed cannot be brought back since the entire class as whole moves on through a designated schedule, and the student would have much work to catch up on in little time. But, if the student was taking online classes and missed multiple classes, the student would only worry little in comparison to a classroom student. Since online classes allow students to work on their own time, the student with the family emergency can always catch up whenever he is done with his personal business and he does not have to worry about other classmates' progress in the class. That way, online learning can be beneficial to the student.

However, the social experience between a student and his peers in the classroom can help the student grow as an individual with good social skills. In the classroom, there must be some communication between the students. For instance, communication among the students is present when the teacher assigns group work. In group projects, such as PowerPoint presentations, Google Slides presentations, dioramas, posters, and videos, students need to work together to complete the assignment. Through this experience, students can create good communication skills with each other and make friends comfortably. This characteristic of the physical classroom cannot be found in a digital classroom. In a digital classroom, students do not see other peers in person, making communication harder. Also, students do not know what is happening behind the screen with other students. Students may mistakenly distort communication with each other, eventually ruining peer relationships. Learning social skills from the classroom will help students' social skills in the outside world, so it is important that students take the physical route to classroom learning rather than online learning.

Student communication with the teacher becomes easier when the student is in a classroom rather than in an online class. In a physical classroom, the teacher is usually present and is easily accessible, but in an online class, the teacher is not always there when a student needs them; the student would have to rely on sending an email or sending a message through a school-sponsored online chat and wait for a response. The waiting time can range from seconds to hours, or perhaps, days, depending on the teacher's schedule. For example, in the summer, a student may take an online class for economics and personal finance. There would be a time where the student would need to ask a proctor a question about the testing rules, so in that situation, he would email and wait for a response before the test date. However, the student received an email regarding testing rules after the test date. In situations like this, there is uncertainty in determining when the proctor will respond since the student does not know exactly when the proctor is online; but, in a classroom, this scenario would not happen. Because the student is face to face with the teacher, he gets an immediate response. This makes the situation much easier and stress free for the student.

Physical experience can help students learn better in a class than on a computer. Online, the student is limited to a screen with lesson materials on it. Also, schools and teachers are limited to adding documents, websites, and tests online. Because of these limits, the online experience feels dull and straightforward with tests and documents. In a physical classroom, there are lectures, models, posters, and hands-on activities available to the student. These physical resources can help a student remember class materials better through the unique experience they would go through. Unlike the online learning experience, a physical learning experience is flexible and fun to the student. A computer will fail to produce these resources to the students because of its limited functionality from technology.

Classroom taught classes are more beneficial to students rather than online classes because of the social skills students attain, the simple communication the students have with teachers, and the memorable physical experience the students gain. These significant differences in physcial classrooms and online classrooms should be taken into consideration by many schools when deciding whether or not they should offer online classes. Technology should not be overused by schools in the age of modern technology; otherwise, modern students will lose the social skills and educational benefits a classroom would have brought. Classroom-based classes will benefit the future of students.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
6E8D4C59132C,"There are many reasons why at home classes can benefit students. Things like getting sick and mental illness can really make it hard for students to get to school. These things could benefit a lot from the option of taking classes at home via online sources along with making the process of school being a little easier on students. Giving an option like this to students would be a great improvement.

It is very common for students to get sick and not be able to attend school due to their illness. When this happens, students can fall very behind in their school work causing them to fail. If students can access their classes from home, it can help solve this problem. Instead of the stress that comes with falling behind, they can keep up with all of their work wherever they may be and whatever condition they may be in.

Many students have mental illnesses that may affect how they work in school. Things like anxiety, depression, OCD, and even bipolar disorders can make school very hard for some people. If there was an option to attend classes at home, these people would barely hesitate to take this opportunity. It may be hard for other people to realize how much these students actually struggle with going to school.

At home classes could really improve the performance of these students with their school work.

Students can have a much easier time going through class at home for many reasons. They will be able to take things at their own pace and without so much pressure on them. When at school, teachers have so much to go through and end up going very fast not giving students a chance to keep up with them. This wouldn't be a problem with online classes since students are able to take the time they need. Also students will be way better in their work while being in the comfort of their own homes.

At home classes are very beneficial for many reasons, from helping when students get sick or for the students who have mental illnesses and also by just making things a bit easier for students. There will definitely be more good than bad from offering the option to attend classes at home for students. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
DFD2C3047A7F,"Do you think that someone in a video or online can help you to be successful apprentice at home?. A lot of students, prefer to assist to the school that you will understand more clearly, than take classes online as result make you confuse and you cannot catch anything that they said, also some of this people wants some of these things, but they don't have sufficient time . Classes online can not be a difference of learning without a presence of mind of some teacher with you.

First , classes online would be really hard for students to learn without precense of some teacher, they will help you in the moment, if you don't understand something. In some cases, people wants to renounce to this clases in the first day that they joined, because of lack of knowledge or understanding, from the person who is explaining to you, and not have the opportunity to review again something that you don't understand, many chances until you got it. Also you can get some problems in your vision for stay facing the computer too much time as result you will get dizziness.

Second, some students doesn't have access to internet or computer at home to receive this classes online because they have low income. That could be a big deal with these people, because they wants to try to learn something from their home's in its free time or break that they have per day or sometimes don't, because they work full time; however schools must have to provide these computers for students that can't go to school every day per week, and for students that cannot buy one ,because they have to work to pay another things at home.

Third, students who have to take care its parents and family, also have to make chores in the house, that's why they cannot be able to take this classes online ,for the insufficient time that they have to do it. According with this problem, some students have to stay at home helping its parents cooking food for them and keep cleaning the house instead stay learnig in any way to be prepare to get a good job when them grow up.

Lastly, for these many reasons, classes online will be really hard for students who doesn't have any way to take this classes at home. However many students said, that would be a great idea for people who doesn't like school or doesn't have time to go throught it. Also many students said , that classes online could be a hard way to learn something without the presence of some teacher, but anyway, always is hard for students to take this classes at home, because some of them has a lot of stuff to do, and is difficult to them.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
A10226201F3A,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Schools are offering distance learning as an option for students. I think they should offer it to students. Specially High School students. I have some reasons on why they should be able to.

Students would be able to focus more if their home. They would have a less chance of getting distracted by anyone. It would be easier for them to learn more and better their self at knowing more information than they would at school learning from a teachers pace. Being able to learn at your own pace would be great for students. They would learn the information better.

It would better their chances of graduating. More students would actually do their work. They would actually do way better doing it at home, because they wouldn't get detracted by anyone that's in the hallway or anyone that in their classroom. The classroom can be a huge distracted to students with everything going on it would be hard for them to get any work done for to even be able to learn everything their suppose to learn.

Giving students that option would benefit them a lot. You have to think about it. If students don't do their work at school it's because their either messing around playing or their not able to focus with others around them. So letting them get the option to learn at home would be great for them.

Some would say that they disagree with letting students be able to learn from home is a bad idea. You have to think about what's best for students. What would help them succeed in life. What would make them want to better their future.

They ask if we think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I think they should give the students the opportunity to want to better their future by letting from learn from home. There is a lot of students that want to learn it's just sometimes hard for them. So they should allow them to do so and see how many would succeed and improve a lot more.  ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Do you think students would benefit more from attending classes from home or from school? Most students require peace and quite while learning. They prefer somehere quite, so that they can focus more; however, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be more distracted and they won't be able to ask questions.

To begin, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be more distracted. For example, Generic_Name was a high schooler. before he started school, he was given the following choices either to take: home classes, attend school, or online classes at school. Generic_Name chose home classes for he thought it was going to make his life easir. The first month was going perfectily fine. He got so used to attending classes from home that he did not take it serous anymore. Most of the time during his class converence, his phone would ring and he would just take it and walk away. Which made him so dictracted. He missed important lessons that he needed to know for the upcoming test. Generic_Name's dictraction was not only his phone, he was disctracted by many more things especially devices. Thus, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home for they would be more distracted.

Second, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't be able to ask quetions. For example,Generic_Name was a junior in high school. She was a very smart girl and she took home classes. Even though she was smart, there was some things that she did not understand in her math class. A day before her exam, her tecaher sent her a review video. While she was watching the it, the tecaher talked about the topic that she was having trouble understing. She wanted to ask a question about it, but she could not because it was a video. The next day her teacher sent her the exam. Generic_Name was not able to ask questions, which was why she failed it. She had to retake the class the next year but she decided not to take it from home. Thus, students would most likely not benefit from being able to attend classes from home for they won't be able to ask questions when they are having trouble understanding.

Some people may say that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This is true because some students focus more when they are learning alone; however, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they may not understand. For example, Generic_Name was finishing her senior year in high school. She was so exited about going to collage, she thought she could do anything she wanted to there. The first thing she did was request for home classes.

After starting her home classes, in the beginning she thought her not understanding what the teacher was teaching is something normal for all beginners. Little did she know that the more she did not understand, the more she failed, and the more it affected her grades. Generic_Name failed her freshmen year in collage because she took the classes from home and did not understand anything at all. Thus, people may say that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students focus more when they are learning alone; however, students would not be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they may not understand.

In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they would be more dictracted and they won't be able to ask questions. Most of the students, espeacially high schoolers, are more likely to be distracted by devices and many more other things, they would not benefit anything from taking classes from home for they get distracted very easily.

D2A4C59D44E0,"Why learning at home could really benefit your kids and help jump start there Future. You can be in the safety of your home and it really helps with Developing a Smarter kid; you could go to a Public School but it's not as good as getting home schooled because of the extra help and Attention you get. Students can also save more gas for their Vehicle(s) on average, and have more Freedom to do what they want Between or During Classes. Students also Don't have to ride on a School Bus which can be very Boring for most Non-Student Drivers, and you don't have to Travel to School everyday. Learning at home has the additional benefit of not feeling as Stressed from others. Students can pay attention more because their minds are not as focused on different things like other students who may be Distracting and Disrupting class. I have been Home Schooled for 2 years during Middle School and it really helped me focus and improve myself in so many ways because I didn't feel like I was feeling constantly stressed, i worked on my homework and school work more which also helped me develop the skill to get it done in a timely manner and not put half of the effort into my papers and Research. Research shows that 71.8% of student that are home schooled have a pay of $20 dollars or more for there starting job. I think home schooling your kid far outweighs the cons of going to a Public School because it's safer, you save more money becuase your not going as far to get your kid a edicuation and it's a better enviorment to work in and you and your kid have way more time to do whatever you want after School. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
27AFA00901D3,"The world that we know is changing so extremely fast. Technology is making everything easier and more mobile. The biggest change it has made is in education. Many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will focus much better and can move at their own pace; however, students would lack basic social skills.

To begin, students taking classes from home will have better focus. Students get distracted and off topic very easy due to the large setting of people. For example, I struggle with getting work done because I get very distracted if there are off topic conversations in the classroom. Many students have this same struggle which could be avoided by taking classes from home.

Next, students can move at their own pace when taking classes from home. People are all different and learn different and at different paces. For example, I learn slower than others in math subjects, but I learn slightly faster than others in science subjects. Many people would benefit from taking classes from home so they can work and learn at the pace that fits them.

On the other hand, students would lack basic social skills if they take classes from home. People usually meet all of their friends, best friends, and associates throughout school. For example, I met my best friend in school in the fifth grade. We have been friends since, and if I had never went to public school I would have never met her. Schooling that is not from home teaches people the basic skills they need to create friendships and build relationships.

To conclude, many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will focus much better and can move at their own pace; however, students would lack basic social skills.

DD297FC6742E,"Educational resources are readily available to all students in a school environment, but they are also at home too. Via online or video conferencing, some schools offer this as a option to students. They attend the class while they are in the comforts of their home.

Whether students prefer home or school, education can be found in many places. In a home, the student can attend the class via video conferencing or online while staying in the comfort of their home. Furthermore, the student could have more time to spend with their family and pets while also working on their school work. School can be stressful to some students and having their pet around could help their stress. If the student doesn't have a pet, their parents could help relieve their stress, having your parents around to help you could be less stressful.

Stress can be the number one reason why some students choose to do their learning at home via online or video conferencing. Laying in bed while doing school work could be less stressful to some since you don't have to leave the comforts of your bed for school. My friend, who actually does online school, says their stress is low since they don't have to worry about being late to class or worry about waking up so early to attend school. Waking up early could be another reason some students wish to attend class at home. A friend of mine wishes to do online school next year to avoid waking up at 6:00 A.M every morning to get ready for school.

Waking up at 6:00 A.M every morning isn't ideal for everyone; Nevertheless, students are required to some form of education whether it be online or in a educational center. Being able to wake up later is another reason why online school could be preferred. My friend says that waking up later is less stressful and tiring and is the reason why they chose online schooling. The friend also states that waking up later is rejuvenating, relaxing, and better.

Those are a few examples of why some students could choose online schooling. While it could be less beneficial to some who have trouble focusing, others it could be the stepping stone they need to be successful.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FF04A1F3B985,"Distance learning is a method of teaching in which a student can use technology to attend a class without ever stepping foot in a classroom. The idea of implementing it has been a hotly debated issue in the education community as some fear that the quality of distance education is lesser than one taught in person. Supporters of distance learning see it as a tool to remove the barriers of education and make it accessible to all people regardless of where they live or if they are differently abled. It is undoubtedly a good idea to implement distance learning into our classrooms as this would allow students who live in extremely rural areas and those who are differently abled to be given the same opportunities as their peers.

Everyone has a right to an education. no matter your sex, gender, nationality, ethnicity, or disability. To deny students who otherwise have no way of receiving a quality education the ability to use distance learning you are denying basic human rights. If a student has no other means of attending school then distancing learning should be a easy, free, and readily available option for them. critics of distance learning may claim that it is an inherently inferior education to in school teaching, but, if what they claim is true, why would the solution be to scrap the idea entirely, thereby completely alienating a portion of the population whose education these programs solely rely? If a system of teaching that is unequivocally necessary has fallen behind in quality, then the solution is to invest not divest. Building a greater infrastructure around distance learning, improving teaching methods, and innovating new technologies are not just a better option than scrapping the idea all together, it is the only option.

Distance learning is essential to maintaining every humans right to an education and should be grown and supported but its place in education should not be overstated. Distance learning should not apply to those who can attend school with no issues. to move an entire education system online would be an absurd over correction to the effect that new technology is having on our schools. Our school system needs to be renovated from the ground up to better ensure that every American is getting a quality education and distance learning is not the future of that system but rather an necessary addition for those who need it. The infrastructure requirements of moving every American student online is an impossible task that would serve to alienate more people that it enfranchises. Distance learning must be implemented as a tool in the tool box of educators because there are many times they will need it, but, there are sometimes when you need a hammer not a screwdriver. Students are not monoliths and each have their own learning styles. While some students would thrive under distance learning others would struggle and fall behind. More programs than just Distance learning will be necessary to ensure quality education to all.

Distance learning is unarguably a good idea. anyone who opposes such programs is either woefully under informed or does not support the rights of man. Distance learning is not, however, a cure all solution to our education woes, but, rather a small part of an even larger and necessary overhaul of the entire American education system. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
2FAE6DFF45F1,"Imagine being in the comfort of your home learning the material for a class while being stress free. Your learning environment plays a big role in how much learning you actually do. The more difficult the class, the more comfortable you should be while taking it. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can learn at their own pace and it can improve their character and work ethic.

Students often benefit entirely from learning at their own pace. It has come times where teachers speed up their lessons to get caught up with the curriculum which is not beneficial for the students. Students do not respond as well to unfamiliar material when they feel rushed so they tend to give up. Also, in a room of twenty or more kids students lack the one on one help needed from the teacher. In harder courses full understanding is a necessity for students. Online courses or video conferencing from home on these difficult courses gives you that individual attention without causing the disruption of others. Being behind in a class while struggling to understand the material and turn in assignments on time can be very overwhelming and stressful. In the end it will do more harm then good. Distant learning can take you one step at a time with no rush into full understanding of material for a course.

Taking a class from home can improve your character and work ethic. When you attend class from home you do not have a physical teacher there to monitor you; therefore, the lack of dictation will cause you to be more responsible in regards to staying on task and being efficient with your work. While in the comfort of your own home, you will have to decide how productive you will be in getting your work done and what you choose to do will show your character as a person. Your integrity will be challenged and your work ethic will increase because you have to be productive on your on terms.

There will be many moments where you face distractions or procrastination. Some may even say you will not get the proper help you need; however, those same distractions and procrastination feelings can still occur in the classroom with a teacher. The environment change is the big difference in the act on taking lasses from home. People may be more productive in an environment their more comfortable in. The learning habits of each individual are different. What may work for one person may not work for the other. What one person takes as to be easy may be very difficult for the other. Home held courses can ensure that your personal needs in regards to the academic field in a particular course are met despite of everyone else's preference.

Distance learning can be beneficial in so many ways. People often find it in their best interest to take this route. Despite all of the concerns, attending classes from home can be very beneficial for students. Not all may benefit from such; however it is a good option for students who are in need of an alternative method to benefit their learning, help out their personal situations, or even just build up their work ethic. It is an experience that should not be taken advantage of but truly used in the best interest of the students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F5DD72FA313E,"One reason, I think is benefits to students have the option to attend classes from their home because that way they can have more time, think more clearly the ideas of their work. Many students would like to take their classes from their home because they cam relax more. However, is a good opportunity to have that option because students can finish they High School and have a motivation to process or do different things. They can do all the things what they propose to do when they graduate from school, they can have the option to go to college or the university to complete their carer.

Another reason, almost all students work when they are in High School and they do not get on time to attend school. Is benefit to them to take the classes from their home, the students can relax more and do their work on time. For example, I would like to take my classes from my home because I work and sometimes I do not had time to finish my homework and all my assignment from my others classes. Others benefits for take classes from your home is you can have more time with your family because some family they work at night and you can't see them. In fact,there are many reason that benefits students to take classes from their home, they can take their time to do the work good and be successful for what they done from their own. Students can learn to do the things by them self. They can have an open mind to understand what are they doing. In other words, school help to prepare for your future that is why is good to finish your education because that helped you to understand what is good and what is bad for you, what you can do or stop to do with your life.

Finally, is a good offer and compression of school to give that option to the students. Although, they understand that some students do not have the opportunity to attend school for some reason or some economic problems that they have it. Also, people can accomplishment all their goals to having good education and having the support of their family and from the school too. Even though, students can be more prepared, and have a good life to comply their dreams. They can have bigger opportunity of works with they High School Diploma .A high school diploma and good grade help students to go to a good college and be completely prepared to work in what they want because in many work need people to have experience and who finish high school and college to be accepted in some work. There many good work that many students would be like to have it and with their preparation they can have the work.

In conclusion, students are benefit with having the option of taking the classes at home, because they have the opportunity to finish the high school and go to the college to finish their carer. Students can use their experience to have a good work with all what they learn from their classes. They can be prepared to they future and a good life. They can find any work in anywhere with their high and college diploma. They can exploit the education that they take to be a good person in life and be confident for what they done with all they effort and dedication. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
066B1D7C9214,"I think many students can benefit from online schooling. Online options at schools can assure every student gets an equal education no matter the circumstances. Students who are too sick or have important responsibilities at home would greatly benefit from the program. As well as students who want to attend a certain school or college but cant because of the distance in between the school and them. A great abundance or students would benefit from online schooling by being able to get an education even if health, responsibilities, or distance is an issue.

Having the option of online schooling would really make a difference in many students education. Whether it be the student is too sick to attend class or even if the student wants to remain home to prevent getting sick. I can directly relate this to the coronavirus epidemic thats unfolding across the US as well as across the globe. Many students have not been able to or are too afraid to attend school on behalf on contracting the virus. Online schooling would allow those students to continue their education from the safety of their own home.

Another reason online schooling would be greatly beneficial is it would give people who cant be out as much the opportunity to learn. Everyone has busy lives, some busier than others, so busy they dont have time to do many things like attend school and get an education. But online schooling programs would change that. For example my Grandma had a very tough childhood. She did not have the luxury of attending school, instead she had to work every weekday to help her parents and little brother financially. She never had the option to attend school, but with the new online schooling programs she would have been able to work as well as get an education from her own home.

Lastly online schooling could drastically help break down the distance border when attending school. Distance has always been an issue in education for not only my family but many others as well. students want to be able to attend certain schools and universities but are either to shy and scared to leave the life theyve created behind or simply cannot afford the travel expenses back and forth from school/ universities to their home town. In my life for example, moving around and being thrown into a new scene causes a lot of stress and anxiety but with the online schooling option, i, as well as many other students, would have the choice to attend our dream schools, with out bringing along unneeded stress and anxiety.

In conclusion, i think online schooling programs would be greatly beneficial for students and teachers. It helps ensure that sick students, students with at-home responsibilities, and students who cant go the distance get an education. To hep get more schools to take on this program, as your principle if your school has on like it, and if not get involved and make one!",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
16DE10816A76,"Students would enjoy attending classes from home because there will be no distractions, and students will have online 1 on 1 with teachers. Many student like working alone. So why not work online from home. I think this will be a good idea for most students. Students would be working and finishing school work faster than what they do in school.

Some schools offer distance learning for trouble kids. I know a couple of my peers that went to my school that are now taking online classes at home. Distance learning dosenÃÂ´t have to be just for trouble kids. Most students just dont like school and probably work better at home. At my school adults would be offering distance learning and you would think of it as a bad thing. Most students like it better than actually waking up, getting dressed, and doing extra things just to go to school.

Most students work better at home then they do at school. When I get home and do my homework I can think properly and do my work with no distractions. This solution is not for every student. Some people are different from others. When your working at home you will focus better than being at school with loud students. Everyone is different in their own way so getting up for school dosenÃÂ´t excite most teenagers. So therefore, students that have a hard time focusing in school can do class work at home.

Students can have their 1 on 1 time with the teacher online. They have video conferencing, So if a student is struggling or needs help with something they can talk to the teacher. Everyone has their own opnion when it comes to this topic. Some parents might think its a good idea for their child to be basically home schooled and some may disagree. Having classes online might be good for some students. everyone can not work at home. I think students would complete their work better and quicker if they was at home. Grades most likely would improve because work is getting done. people that like phiscal help better i would not recommend doing distance learning. This should be something that will help students that gets easily distracted in classrooms. Students would get a lot done and accomplished because their are no distractions and 1 on 1 time.

This solution would help a lot of students. This would benefit students in a good way, excpeclly with grades, distractions, getting work done on time and more. Students would improve in most of their school work. This solution would decrees confusion like in classrooms you wouldn be as confused because students would be at home getting 1 on 1 help. Distance learning might be the best thing for students. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BB207C714EBA,"Distance learning is valuable because not every student is capable of being in a school setting for a number of reasons. Distance learning is online schooling, homeschooling or paid programs like K-12. Online school is exactly like regular school, there's a specific time you need to be online with your instructors, same thing with programs like K-12, you have a specific time to get all things in just like you would in public or private schools. There's many reasons students need to be enrolled in these types of programs, like severe social anxiety, learning disabilities, or health issues. A plethora students across the world face different stipulations than others, like being born with a learning disability.

Many parents strive to enroll their children with learning disabilities into a public school so they wouldn't feel like they don't belong or they're not normal. But some parents take a step back and realize that bullying is a huge issue in public schools, and they don't want them to be exposed to hate or even the unnecessary pressures from learning, that the student wouldn't face if they learned from home. The social and educational stress that is put upon students in public schools is another reason why online schooling would be a good option for students that have severe social anxiety. I have been in a class with a student that was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder, and every time that I would see her, which wasn't often, she would be nauseous or very confused and eager to leave quickly, which led me to believe students with anxiety disorders should be working from home where they are the most comfortable. Seeing someone struggle with being around just a small class of 22 people, made me feel as though online schooling is something certain students really depend on.

Homeschooling by a in home instructor, like a parent or guardian, is another option taken by a number of parents for various reasons. Homeschooling is a great option for parents that don't want students to be exposed of the things that they may have went through when they were a child or the ones that don't want their children's lives to revolve around just school from ages 6 to 18, so they can learn various different skills and show their more creative side. Celebrities like Billie Eilish or Finneas O'Connell, can attest to the fact that homeschooling was something that they feel as though was one of the best things their parents could've done for them. They were able to grow up with the freedom of expression for their creativity and hobbies without the pressures of school being the #1 priority in their lives. Some students never really get to emit or expand upon their talents because school is told to be one of the most important aspects of your lives, and if you don't do well, you'll never succeed in life.

Distance learning is like a god send to the students that crack under the pressure of school and the high expectations that come with it like your social status. With growing up comes the many mistakes you make while growing. Trusting the wrong people, being surrounded with the wrong crowd or just putting yourself in compromising positions are all things that can lead to someone never wanting to go back to a public school. I've witnessed a number of girls in my class get their nude photos exposed to the school because they trusted the wrong person with their body. That kind of backlash and bullying made them enroll into online courses until they felt comfortable with easing back into a public setting. Being able to enroll into online school during such a low point in their lives, could've saved them from wanting to commit suicide or harm themselves if they had to stay and deal with the bullying they faced.

County's that offer distance learning are doing thousands of kids justice by letting them learn at their own pace comfortably. Distance learning could save so many lives and help many others. I truly believe that letting a child progress at their own pace instead of expecting them to be able to run the same race the same way and finish at the same time as hundreds of other students, is an amazing thing. Letting a child be comfortable and able to take care of their health and mental health while being educated is something that should be an open option for those who really need it. Being educated is a key part in what path you will walk through in life, and distance learning is that first step into that path a student will walk through. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D8C149300D31,"Distance learning is a recent innovation that some schools now offer by way of online or video conference. It is becoming a popular method of education because kids do not like getting up early in the morning and going to school for eight hours. The online method allows kids to log on to class at whatever time of the day to do their work. I do not think it is healthy to take these classes and stare at a computer screen all day, rather, I believe children should go to school and sit in a classrooom to learn. Students do not benefit from this type of learning as much as they would if they went to a school because individuals would have less of a way to make friends and enjoy their school experience, there would be no sports that people could do, and their is not as much guidance or help that a person could reach out to if they needed it.

Online teaching does not allow kids to make friends or have the same school experience that a person should have in their life. I believe that it is essential for people to have the experience of school because it will be useful in the workforce and the real world. There will be amazing and terrible times in a school but there will also be amazing and terrible times in someone's life. I, myself, have had horrible things happen to me during my school career but also some of the rest things that have ever happened to me have been because of school. For example, I have won various academic awards during my high school career and that will be very useful later in life when I am applying for a job.

Furthermore, there would be no chance to play sports that could very well shape a person's future. Many people around the world compete in sports for a living such as football, basketball, soccer, and many other things. The people that are on teams, such as the Miami Heat for the National Basketball Association, started out playing this sport in elementary or high school, they then went on to college, and now they are making millions of dollars playing for a famous sports team. They are making money by doing what they love and it all started when they were in school. Taking classes through a computer screen does not give individuals the chance to do such things because there is no teams that they could join.

Lastly, there is not as much guidance for someone with this method of learning and these classes. Kids struggle with all different subjects; whether it be math, reading, writing, science, or history, there needs to be someone in front of them to help them work out the issue when there is one. Studies show that kids learn better from someone when they are getting help from a teacher in a classroom. This is because the child can interact and communicate better with the teacher being with them. Also, teachers are sometimes kids lifelines because children have sad home lives and brutal families these days. Having the one on one relationship with a student can make all the difference in the world.

There are people that would argue saying children are better off taking the online classes because it helps with mental health. I believe that mental health would still be negatively affected if a person went the route of taking online classes because no matter if you are in a classroom or if you are at home, there is still social media and it is the number one cause of teen depression, not school. If a parent wants to help a child's mental health they should make them stay away from social media. A person should not have to miss out on such a great time in their life because of anxiety. If they stay around nice people and do not get involved with bullies, there mental health will be in balance.

To conclude, I strongly believe that children should be in a classroom at a school instead of being at home on the computer taking classes every day because school brings about exciting experiences, allows children to let their athletic ability shine, and gives them guidance they need to finish high school. If I would have taken all of my classes online and stayed at home, I do not think I would be as happy as I am coming to school every day and being with my friends. I have not so exquisite days just like anyone else would but I would not change my life for anything. It has made me turn from an introvert to an extrovert because I have had to quit being a shy little kid. School is essential to having a profound life and to making it in this world. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

DBB590C34361,"Going to school from home sounds like one of the greatest ideas to think of. There's no getting dressed or rushing to avoid missing the bus because all of the school work is online and can be done at home. It seems like a smooth and easy process. However, it could be very tedious, and for some, impossible. Students would not benefit from online classes/ classes at home because they they might not have the means to purchase a device to be able to take said class and because they can easily get distracted at home rather than at school.

One reason why students would not benefit from taking classes from home is because they might not have the money to purchase a device to do their work on. For example,some children are not financially stable at home, therefore they wont have a device to use to complete their tasks that they are assigned. This would mean that they would have to travel somewhere else to access a computer to do their work. Doing that defeats the purpose of the classes being at home because the student would have to go somewhere else to do the work. It would be smarter to attend classes at school because they provide you with electronic devices to complete your work on and there is no worry about purchasing a device to do work on.

Another reason why attending classes from home is would not benefit students is because it gives students a better chance to get distracted or procrastinate. For example, when most students come home from school, they watch TV, eat a snack, or take a nap. If students took online classes, they might end up getting distracted by the TV or eating. Some students also dont complete their homework at home because they procrastinate so much that its too late to do it. Attending classes at home just gives the student the opportunity to be lazy and complete their tasks only when they feel like it. Taking classes at school would be easier because students would not be able to get distracted by the TV or procrastinate as much and more work would get done rather than if they were to do it at home.

Some will argue that taking classes at home is beneficial because it eliminates getting ready for school. They might also say that it's easier because work can be completed at any time the student feels like completing it. However, some students might not be financially stable, and the only way they eat is when they're at school. Online classes could prevent some students from getting their well needed meal. As for the other reason, most jobs run on a schedule and have specific times that they prefer things to be completed. Coming to school will help equip students to be prepared for a job because at school, students run on a schedule and are expected to have things completed at a specific date just like a regular job does.

Attending online classes from home is not the best decision for many reasons. However, attending classes at school helps expose students to the world and to new things that they wouldn't be able to observe if they were to be at home everyday. It also helps students to adjust their lives to get ready for the ""adult world"" and to successfully obtain a job and be great at it. Also, As mentioned before, there's no hassle to purchase a device to complete work on because in school, all those things are provided for the student.

Although it would be nice to relax at home and take online classes, the smarter choice would be to attend classes at school to avoid procrastination and to avoid spending unnecessary money.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
29D0D6C26624,"Throughout human history, education has been evolving and advancing. From textbook studying to using online programs, the education system is constantly adapting for the future. One of the numerous options of learning is by taking online classes at home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it is safer, more comfortable, and better for their well being.

Students would benefit from online learning, because it is safer. At school, students come in contact with hundreds of people by force. The crowded hallways make it easy for diseases to spread. However, by taking online courses, students will be safe from any sickness, because they will not make physical contact with others. Going to school could also put a student's life in danger. School shootings are not rare, and it is difficult to protect every student from being harmed. Students will not have to risk their lives to learn if they attended class through video conference or online courses.

It is beneficial for students to attend online classes, because it is more comfortable. Most students would agree that they would rather be in the comfort of their own home than be at school. During school, students face needless stress from the environment they are in. Staying at home would not only be more relaxing, but it would also create the right headspace that is fit for learning. Ultimately, attending school from home would benefit students more, because it decreases their stress level and provides a more comfortable environment for them to learn.

Taking online courses or video conferencing is beneficial to students, because it is better for their health. For example, many students have to wake up 2-4 hours earlier than the school start time, because they must get dressed and catch the bus. This lack of sleep will cause them to be more likely to sleep during class and will make it more difficult for them to grasp the information. Most students also skip breakfast; they simply don't have the time to eat. Being hungry makes them lose focus on what is being taught. Students are starving and becoming sleep deficit because of school. However, students will be able to wake up at a more comfortable time and eat breakfast if they didn't have to leave their home.

It is understable that many say students will not benefit from home learning. Some reasons may be that they will slack off or cheat. Although these may be true, it is undeniable that it is more beneficial to learn in a place you are comfortable with than to learn in a place which you are forced to be at.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend class at home because it is safer, more comfortable, and better for their health.

29899EC43F4A,"Modern day life has been taken over by new and developing technology for over two centuries. With this comes more inovative and productive ways to go about everyday life. To put it in perspective, educational material is traditionally taught in a class room setting, however with limelight technology humans are able to take it into the comfort of their own bed. This alternative era of education has sky-rocketed online education, but is it better than the classroom. Although some may believe other wise, limtation on social skills, getting side tracked, and learning inccorectly proves students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

First and foremost, online education can impact future social skills. Getting an education online limits the number of interactions with others than compared to a students who goes to public school. On the other hand many would say this is a great option for someone who is anti-social, however this will not help with their future endevours. Online courses do give you the opportunity to work with other students, but a monitor blocks a future relationship that could have been built with others. In a classroom setting it is easier to build relationships which could possibly benefit you in the future. It is always said that connections are what get a person far in life and online classes could be the ultimate limitation from a boost in ones career.

Additionally, getting side tracked is easier in online classes than in the classroom. While taking an online class it is extremely difficult to not get your focus taken about by other things occurring around you. In a classroom you are consistently being supervised by an adult making it easier to stay focused on classwork. Personally I have taken a few online courses and I find it difficult to meet deadlines for assignments and finals because the teachers don't push you to better yourself. The teachers will tell you when the final is and that is all they will do. Online classes shouldn't be taken by someone who finds time managment to be difficult. This can then bleed into not giving your all in classwork and eventually not learning material in the best way possible for yourself.

Moreover, online classes can lead to being taught material incorrectly. It isn't clearly understood by most that online classes are prodominently self-taught and that can be consequental. Many students need to be instructed on how something is done in order to learn new material presented to them. By not understanding your personal learning style, it is possible to unintentionally set yourself up for failure. On the contrary, there are people who are able to learn better on their own, but personal experiences have proven the class room setting is more beneficial for young students due to their maturity.

To conclude, being able to attend classes from home wouldn't help students due to the possibility of learning incorrect information, being able to get side tracked easily, and causing a disruption in their social skills. This will not be benefitcial to their future and there aren't many pros to this alternative.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D8C47A7C4F39,"What comes to mind when you think of the word school? Do you think about waking up early, going to boring classes, and lots of tests and homework? Well what comes to mind when you think about online schooling at home? Do you think about lounging in bed, eating whatever you want whenever you want, and doing work only when you feel like it? That's how most students think about these two different types of schooling, but when you think about it, is going to school really that bad when compared to online school? When looking at the big picture, I don't think that students would benefit from being able to take classes at home because there is less social interaction, there are more distractions, and there aren't as many fun experiences.

I feel that if students were to take online classes at home, they wouldn't get to learn how to collaborate with their peers. A school environment is essential in that it teaches students how to collaborate with peers and gain leadership skills through projects and assignments. These are skills that are important for the workplace and for working with people throughout life. School is usually the place where most people meet their first friends and learn how to talk to and deal with those peers as they grow up. I feel that online school takes that aspect of socialization away from students and doesn't allow them to put themselves out there because they're always at home. With that being said, it is also easier for students at home to turn to social media to communicate with others, which can be dangerous because they don't really know who they're interacting with.

I also feel that taking online classes at home could jeopardize students' learning because being in the comfort of their home will make for more distractions that wouldn't be available in a classroom, such as T.V., phones, video games, etc. Students will be more inclined to use these things because they are readily available. When taking classes at school, students don't have access to as many distractions because most teachers don't permit the use of personal technology in the classroom. Students are also more inclined to procrastinate and slack off when they take classes online because the teacher isn't monitoring their work, whereas in a school classroom, the teacher is in the room making sure that the students are completing their assignments on time. I know from personal experience that students are more likely to work when they are in a working environment, so I think that it wouldn't be beneficial to have them work at home.

Finally, I feel as though online school makes students miss out on some fun experiences that happen at school, such as after school clubs and activities that might provide students the opportunity have great experiences and bond with the new people they've met, field trips to museums, colleges, and amusement parks, school dances, which provides chances for them to go out and have fun with their friends, etc. Online school doesn't give students any outlet to do these activities as a group. Although the students might be able to do these activities on their own time, doing it as a school and seeing everyone united and having fun together gives a sense of belonging, and it makes them feel like they're part of a team.

Although the thought of online schooling at home is nice, I feel that it's important to remember that going to school makes students more well-rounded and provides them with many more opportunities. Students get to start to venture out and learn more about the world they live in and the people in it. I believe that school will give students unforgettable experiences, good or bad, that will teach them essential life lessons.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D5EE6230B88E,"Going to school is the worst way to attend classes. Online or video conferencing would benefit students to attend classes. Although going to school helps. Taking a class at home, student don't have to worry about classmates bulling, being late cause there is no place to travel, and having no food to eat in school.

Waking up early every morning to school can be very stressful. Students have to take a shower, brush their teeth, some girls put on makeup, and then packing the school bag. Students often get lazy getting up from bed therefor missing the bus. So they have to stay home, maybe wait for a ride, or even walk to school. Most students don't get a good amount of sleep that makes their focus off in class, also the hunger get the best of them which makes it worst. Working online students may pick the time that best fit them and the student stay home. So he or she don't need to worry about looking good.

Attending online classes there will be no classmates which is a good thing. Having no classmates he or she can focus on work, because the student is not in the class with a lots of people that will makings noises or distract the student. Since your not in a classroom nobody can bully, tease, or judge the student. That makes some students go though depression in school by bullies. For example the way he or she dress, looks, smells, or did in the pasts. It will make students not attend school no more. Therefor online classes students will be working by their self which will give them more focus on school work.

What can you benefit attending class from school? Going to school he or she can commutative with other people to make friends. Students can ask teacher or friends for more help. Cause the student is going out parents are saving money by the electric bill will be lower. By he or she going to school they can do sports or programs after school to help choose their career, and not be coup up staying at home.

In conclusion attending online class can benefit the students. It the best way to get the education. By keeping the students safe from bullies, no distraction from classmates, always have food to full up the belly to focus, and taking online classes that can work on the students time.                                                   ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
FF7C9DB45E8F,"Students that receive online classes at home and cannot attend to school is not benefit to learn. Being at home can get distracted and it is not the same in school to receive classes with a teacher who can help and have the attention of students for better explanations. As the video conferencing does not develop social and how speak with smartness.

First at all, online does not benefit students to the education and the culture to learn. It is not the same way to ask questions to teachers to obtain specifics answers and explanations. At the same time, the brain need to develop in socialize with people around us. As example, students who cannot speak English very well, it is important to attend classes in school to socialize and speak more for develop language.

Another reason, the education of students can relate with respect to others and show the culture of education that teachers in school gives every day and it is better than distance learning. On the other hand, online benefit some students that missed school as to finish the homework. However, school benefit students to show knowledge at least earn credit in school and obtain the diploma.

At last, some students that cannot attend school because of jobs or other reasons, the schedule in school still help every day. Most for Seniors, this help to continue attend school and have better ways to learn. Schools and teachers are the reasons why children and teenagers learn about life.

In conclusion, online does not benefit as attend school because it is better to show the knowledge and share opinions with people around us. The school help student to develop social and language.

1C22B0A7AAB8,"Most students adapt to society by the environment of school life. Therefore, if every school were to offer online education our society would weaken. Online schooling does not benefit the majority of students. Most students do not consider online schooling as an option because they would miss out on so many activities. In addition, it is very difficult to make friends their age if more students were home schooled.

Majority of the students who have considered online schooling as an option, only consider it because they simply do not want to do the work that the school has provided them. Some students do not take school seriously and find online schooling as a safe route. Therefore, those that take advantage of online schooling make it unfair for students who go to school and take their education seriously. In addition, those who attend school from home do not have to wake up as early as the students who attend regular school. Most students find that as a good thing, but in reality, school is just preparing them for when they are adults and have to wake up that early every single day.

Some students who are home schooled will have a harder time adjusting to the real world. Therefore, attending online school will not be beneficial to their future in the long run. Also, some schools do not offer online schooling because it is difficult to find someone who has the ability to teach a student who is home schooled. Online schooling is both not beneficial to the student and school district as well. After students graduate and become adults, they have a tough time adapting by being on their own. Therefore, when the students that were home schooled graduate, they not only have to adapt to being a young adult but also society as well.

Some people think that online schooling is beneficial to those who are unable to able to attend school regularly. Although, that may be true for the ones that are severely ill, however, there other options than home schooling. Education should be every students top priority. Without being properly educated nobody can ultimately survive in today's society.

Therefore, someone who is home schooled can not be properly educated because they will not have the proper resources and life skills to survive in today's society.

Although, most schools offer online schooling it is not beneficial to students in the long run. Our society as a whole would weaken if more students attend school at home. Those who are home schooled miss out on so many extracurricular opportunities. Students who attend school at home have so much potential, but without attending regular school they do not have most of those opportunities. Students who attend regular school are better prepared for when they graduate and are on their own. School is only preparing students for the real world, and in order to survive in today's society someone has to have been properly educated. After students graduate the people at school or at home will not be there to guide them through society.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
0D0BB94FCCFA,"Have you ever thought about what students could do with extra time on their hands? Students would benefit from online learning because it would be easier to focus, they would have more free time, and it can be used when regular schools are not available. Online school has been considered recently and could be coming very soon. If it happens, we could see if it really benefits students in as many ways as we think. Having online school could be a short term solution or as a permanent solution.

During school, many students can lose focus due to the amount of time they spend in school. By having online school, the usual 7 hour school day would be shortened because of the limitations of online school. Spending 7 hours in school tires the mind and with online school, students can work at their own pace. Students would work better in an environment they are more comfortable with like their bedrooms. The added benefit of being able to take a break whenever would allow students to sleep in instead of having to wake up early in the morning.

Having online school would give students more free time for other activities like sports or hobbies and would remove the stress that comes with school. With free time on their hands, students could do other things they normally would not be able to like apply for jobs, practice sports, and spend time with friends. Students that work or are involved with sports do not have much time to complete assignments and can discourage students to take excelled classes. This limit of time can be stressful for students and many students end up staying up late in order to finish. By giving the students more free time to work or practice sports, students would be able to complete their work on time without stressing over it.

Online school can be used for a temporary replacement for regular school in times of emergencies. Students who are unable to attend school due to disease or injury would be able to keep up with the class through online learning. It could prove useful during times of disease outbreaks like corona virus. Instead of keeping schools open with a risk of infecting students and staff, schools would consider switching to online school for as long as it is needed. Schools could consider using online learning to make up for snow days as well.

Students would benefit from online school because it would be easier to focus, it would give them more free time, and it could be used as a temporary replacement if needed. Having online school temporarily or permanently would benefit students and teachers alike. The amount of time saved by using online school instead of regular school would be huge. Schools would not have to spend nearly as much time as they do teaching students. The amount of time cut and the mental benefits it would provide for students would be very beneficial to their health and to the way they learn",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Recently, Generic_Name has been going to school the past 10 years.

In those years, Generic_Name has proved his apprenticeship by taking classes in the school.

More often his grades are the higher in the class, and his teacher is glad that he still going to her class.

Learning in school with a teaher next to him was important for Generic_Name to get those grades.

Teachers believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it makes student's attention lower, and they do not learn as the same way.

Firstly, student would not benefit from begin able to attend classes from home because it makes student's attention lower.

For example, Generic_Name wants to get out of school next week, yet he wants to takes classes online, but his teacher told him that is not the best option for him.

This example shows that the teacher is telling Generic_Name don't take classes online, it would not benefit his attention at classes in the same way that school does.

Even though, Generic_Name thinks that is the best idea, at the same time is not because the only way to don't lose his attention at classes is to continue the school.

Thus, attend classes from home is not going to benefit a student attention.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they do not learn as the same way.

For example, Generic_Name is a student of a New York's school, his teacher says that when he started classes online he did not learned as the same way that he used to do at school.

This example shows that when Generic_Name did not continue classes in school he started to have problems with the topics because students can not learn in the same way that in school.

For Generic_Name was not important learn properly in home or school, but for his teacher yes becuase they knew already that it would not benefit learning in the same way.

Thus, distance learning is not the best option fro a student.

On the others hand, some people believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

It is true, it can be possible when a student do not speak the language, and his/her parents prefer that the student take classes online.

However, still proof that students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home.

For example, the teachers of Generic_Name and Generic_Name say that distance learning does not help students to improve their attention and apprenticeship.

Thus, it can benefit students the classes online in 20%, but the classes in schools benefit students in a 100%.

In conclusion, to restate the point students would not benefit attend classes from home.

The first reason is because it makes students's attention decrease.

Further, students are not going to learn in the same way that they used to do in school.

However some people believe that taking classes online from home will benefit to the students.

Thus, coming to school is the best way that is going to benefit the students to attend in classes.             ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
C352163DBB69,"Being a student for quite sometime, I can honestly say that school hours are way too early for a developing mind like mine to obtain and learn information from numerous subjects. Not only that, but students and teachers have to walk, ride their bike, and drive to school under harsh and unsafe weather conditions. Most teachers have to get out of bed and get to the school building a whole hour or two before students, which means driving or commuting before sunrise. All of those safety irregularities can easily be prevented by going to school online or by video conferencing. It can be incredibly beneficial for not only students, but teachers as well.

Having a scheduled time to learn will give both teachers and students the benefactor. Teachers can teach while relaxing in bed, while students can learn and take care of the little ones. No more 5am alarm clocks, no more mom and dad pulling you out your bed, and no more missing the bus or being late to school. Students can eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner without waiting for some dismissal bell. Online school may even be extended to some partial extent of the weekend to give longer summer breaks perhaps. Teachers would benefit by not having students skip their class, not doing their work, and flunking. There is no doubt that grades would surely improve, and more and more parents would be sending there kids off to college. Teachers would actually seem to be getting paid really well considering they're working from home and not in some really cold or really hot classroom. Rain or shine, wet or dry, students can grow to be great without even stepping out the door.

Now as good as all that sounds, there are of course several inquires to it. Students would have no excuse to be absent or tardy to class since "" class "" is sitting at their desktop. If your sick, your learning about JFK. If it's snowing, your learning about the World Wars. If your going on a road trip, your studying for or even taking your tests and exams. Bottom line, unless your on your death bed, your learning someway somehow regardless of the situation because school is now available digitally. Of course Christmas, Thanksgiving, Winter and Spring Break, and few other holidays would still be in effect, but other than that, your going to be learning about something for 7- 8 continuous hours. With online school, students unfortunately would never get the actual high school experience like sitting in the desks, going through million of pencils, and making friends. Online school would limit students social education, which can severely hurt them in the long run. It's very crucial that students interact with one another in person because they're going to be using throughout their lives.

As you can see, going to school online or video conferencing can be incredibly beneficial for students and teachers, but it won't give you the actual school experience with all the textbooks, crayons and loose leaf paper. Distance learning should really be considered in the future since it wouldn't even be possible in the past without computers and smart phones.

A28E9B475935,"My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus.

Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home.

To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise.

Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example,

Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication.

Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus.

To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home.

A7BF283E400C,"Many students have had the ability to get a quality education, without a classroom. Modern day technology has provided a way to bring the classroom into the home, this is called distance learning.

Distance learning should be an option for students because it could bring education to all, it would save students time, and it allows students to take their future outside of a classroom. In order to understand why distance learning should be an option, let's look at the day of one the students in my high school.

Generic_Name wakes up every day at six in the morning to do chores, then to get ready for school. By seven in the morning he is already on his way towards our high school. He has to get there early in order to receive help from his homework he was working on last night. By the time school starts he is already three hours into his day. Once his seven hour school is over he has to drive another forty minutes home, just to do more chores, and to start on his homework for the following day. Generic_Name has to drive a pick up truck because of the area he lives in, which means that his gas mileage is pretty low. He has to get a new tank of gas every three days or so. It costs him forty dollars to fill up his tank. With his long commute to school, he doesn't have time to get a part time job to pay for his gas himself, instead his parents have to pay around eighty dollars a week just so he can go to school. Distance learning would solve many of these problems that Generic_Name is going through. It would allow Generic_Name to get an education even though he lives a great distance from the school. With modern day technology we have the ability to Skype, face time, or even video conference into classrooms in order to provide everyone with a fair and equal opportunity to get an education. Distance learning would help to provide the right of education to everyone.

Just because we have a right to education does not mean that getting an education is going to be easy. Most high school students today are known to be stressed out, mentally ill, and overworked. In Generic_Name situation he has to help his mother with his little siblings, cut fire wood, and make breakfast before he even starts to think about the math equations he couldn't figure out the night before. Generic_Name, like many other students, is over worked, and stressed out. He has a lot of responsibilities that he has to uphold. Taking away the drive, and taking away the financial burden would save Generic_Name a lot of time. He may be able to get a part time job in order to help his mother pay some bills, or even start to save money for college, or even just to get work experience. Distance learning would solve a lot of problems in his life, because high school isn't always a great place for students.

High school provides a lot of teenagers the ability to grow. It makes a lot of students think about the people around them, it forces teenagers to meet and work with people that are different than them. However, high school isn't always a good use of your time and energy. Being on the JV football team is not going to prepare you to take responsibility for your future career and family. It could be a distraction from what is really important in life. Distance learning would provide the students that see through the facade of the ""high school experience"" to cut the chase. Get to the final goal of high school, and moving onto the next stage in life. High school experiences only last for a moment, but your education lasts a life time.

Distance learning should be an option for students because it could bring education to all, it would save students time, and it allows students to take their future outside of a classroom. The ability to use technology in order to help those in need is not something that we should overlook or take for granted. We constantly should be looking for ways to help teenagers become more successful in their future. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
80D2FE30F665,"Offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing by schools is a good idea, but I take a position on this issue to say that, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes classes from home due to the following reasons.

First of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.

Another reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesn't get any understanding, or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year.

Lastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.

From these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.

79CDD9460FB4,"Would you want to learn math from the comfort of your couch? Schools are beginning to give students opportunities such as these through online classes or video conferencing, which allows students to take classes anywhere they would like. These advancements come along with a new wave of technology that has allowed us to be more connected than ever before. However, online classes still have their limits. Online classes require a different set of skills to teach than what teachers have been taught. Although online classes would provide more flexible schedules for the students, the students would be distracted from the lessons, limited in the help they can receive, and losing the social skills that school provides.

First of all, while taking an online class, it is much easier for a student to become distracted than with a regular class. Today, more students than ever before have access to technology such as laptops, phones, and tablets. With an increased usage of these devices, much of the student population has become addicted to their devices. In many classrooms, teacher struggle to combat the students' addiction to their phones, having to take breaks in order to tell kids to pay attention. If students were allowed to take online classes, there would be no one to tell them to get off their phones and pay attention. When talking about video lessons done at home, one Generic_School student says, ""I don't actually pay attention, I just go on my phone while the video plays."" This is a trend that would be seen across a majority of students if they were allowed to take their lessons home. By going on their phone during the video, they will miss crucial points in the lesson the will prevent them from doing well in the class. Since the students will have missed many of the crucial points in the lecture, they will have questions about how to do certain things from the lectures.

Another reason is that students will not be able to receive as much help in the classes that they take online. Students in online classes will have missed much of the information in the lectures, so they will need to ask someone questions about what they missed. However, there will be nowhere for them to ask these questions. One option for these students would be to email a teacher. However, a response from the teachers may not always be reliable - in the past, if my teachers respond at all, it has taken some up to 4 days to respond. The student may be in urgent need of this information for an upcoming test, and if they aren't able to get the information on time, they will not be adequately prepared for the test. This becomes ever harder in subjects like math where every unit tends to build on a previous one. If a student misses the information and isn't able to ask a teacher the question, they will start to fall behind, possibly causing them to fail the class.

Finally, students who take online classes will miss out on learning the social skills involved in everyday life. In online classes, there is no interaction between students; it is just a student watching a teacher lecture in a video. Sitting at home removes interactions between students which would have created important social skills, lifelong friendships, and a respect for others. An infamous man from history who grew up in a situation without these three things was Joseph Stalin. As a young boy, Stalin was lonely and never had many friends. It was this loneliness that led him in becoming one of the most feared men in the world. He believed that the correct way to befriend someone was to scare them into it. He believed that when someone disagreed with a word he said, they should be killed. But above all, he believed deep down that this was a bad world and everyone in it hated him. If Stalin had learned simple social skills as a child, he would've been able to solve his problems more diplomatically, instead of relying on the violence he was known for. Social skills, learned by interaction between others in school, are crucial to a human's success in life, and without them, you will be lost with no way out.

Online courses would mislead students by letting them get away with not paying attention, giving them no way to seek out help, and preventing them from developing the social skills necessary to make it in the real world. However, others believe that online classes would provide students with extra time to have for themselves. While this is true, this extra time is used in ways that can hurt the students life. Many students wouldn't use this new found time to be with their friends, they would just end up sitting in their room on their phones doing nothing. Even worse than this, many students would take this extra time and begin to party, which may cause them to do things that could ruin there life. Keeping classes in schools is important so that the students are prepared to take the place of their parents and steer the world in a better direction. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
8542D5615740,"Most students would love the idea of being able to learn and be at home while doing it. I do think that students would benefit from doing online schooling instead of going to school everyday. One reason i agree with i distance learning is because you can wake up at a time you would like to and be able to do school at your own pace. Not having to wake up at a certain time to make sure that you can catch the bus or make it to school on time without getting a tardy or an unexcused pass for being late to school. Another reason is the passing and graduating rate would go up because children would be in their own space and wouldn't be told what to do or when to do it.

The reason why most kids do not come to school today is because they feel as if school starts to early and they dont get enough sleep. And the result of that is not being able to focus in class and and causing them to fall asleep in class. Studies have shown that the brain doesn't start to fully function until ten o'clock in the morning,most teenagers do not go to sleep until one or two o'clock in the morning. So when they have to wake up at five o'clock or maybe even four in the morning to catch the bus they wont go. Which causes them to miss important work and classes that they need to graduate.

As a teenagers,they tend to have a lot put on them at a young age. Most of them have jobs or have to look after somebody at home. That isn't including the homework and projects that they get from teachers .Working as a teenager and being a full time student can be hard because you have to balance the two of them. For example if a teen has to look after their sick grandmother because that once was their caregiver they should not have to leave home just to come to school when they can stay home and still learn the same thing they would if they were in school.

More schools should offer online schooling,or maybe even just trying it out to see how many students would actually use it and see if that makes a change in that system. I think most kids would appreciate the fact that people think about them and how they have other stuff going on in their life. Kids would be happier,the grades would appear better and it would relive a lot of stress for not only the kids but the teachers also. Because the teachers have to wake up earlier than the kids do just to be at school and teach when they can be in the own comfort of their home but still teaching. It would help a lot of people and would not cause them to drop out.

Online schooling could also be a bad thing,because most kids stay at home all day and do nothing already. So having them stay home for school could be making it worse. Having them up everyday for school is not only getting them out the house but getting them active as well. Mostly all teenagers are on their phone, in front of the television or playing video games as soon as they get home up until they go to bed. So having them going to school and not being able to have their phones in school is a good thing.

In conclusion, online schooling should be avavbile to all the schools around the world. Not only would it help the students struggling to make it to the bus or school on time it will help them be smarter and better them in all aspects. Their grades will show it, the test scores will be higher and all homework will get done. Everybody will be more focused and not distracted. Kids wont be in trouble as much and they will get the help that they actually need because everybody will be in their own homes and they wont be afraid to say they need help.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

The students that suffer bullying at the end they will have collateral damage that affect directly on his life, sometimes the suffer of the bullying cause a bunch of students ends their life for bullying, others ends with psychological problems cause by bullying.

All person have problems, some have problems with the law, others with persons, everyone have their own problems; but for students is not different, all students have their own problems with drugs, police, at home and other at school. Students reflect their problems with their actions and the things they do on their lives, all schools have that type of students, some use drugs in school, others try to be the bad guy of the school and is normal because all of that are just excuses for their problems, inclusive there are some students that want to be at school all day for not go back to home, that type of students think that school are the only save place they have away from home but for others is different they don't want to be in school because they have problems with other students or teachers and they want to stay away of all problems and the only place they have is at home and that is why they choose to have distance learning.

Students also have legal problems, not all of the students of any country are legal, some have problems with their residential status, others have problems with their papers because their some countries that have families that came from another country and don't have anything that make their status legal. Students also makes mistakes that cause their freedom, like stealing food or money because their are poor or don't have anything to eat, others start do everything for have money, escape from school, start sell drugs or something that can change their lives like start to kill people for money.

every student had something to deal with and others just are lucky because they had everything money, family and one mom & dad or both that are there every time is needed for his child, but not all students had the same lucky on their lives.

The last reason that why is beneficial to have distance learning is for students how has disease, some students have disease like don't walk, don't talk and other things are the most taking distance learning because with distance learning the school can find a special teacher that can help the student on their process to learn, study and prepare for the future. Some students with disease came to school and have their special class and other take normal classes, but the major part of those students stay and home and do the distance learning for their save and protection.

Distance Learning is not just about school, learn and prepare for the future. Distance learning is the way some school had to save students and let they choose if they want to came to the school or stay in home taking classes.

Students how are taking distance learning are students with different types of problems, some of those problems are bullying, distance learning keeps that students away for the bullying and for every problem the student has on school. That is why is beneficial for students being able to take distance learning.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
7CDBC36566FF,"My opinion on online schooling from home is that I believe that there are a lot of benefits with it and at the same time problems. I mostly beleive that there are going to be problems with being schooled from online. Many people believe that it might be better and some might not it's all a persons opinion on it, everyone learns different in my head. I believe that the problem from being taught online is that you're not getting the help you would be able to get in class like actual 1 on 1 learning. I don't think that students are able to learn as much as they actually would in an online classroom instead of an actual one because students just aernt as focused at home than they are at school. Your home is mainly a place to relax for most people and that's my biggest concern because students just want to lay in bed, play games, or hangout with friends because that's what I'd rather do. In my opinion student's these day's are getting lazier and far more irresponsible and it's affecting their school day to day life. I just don't believe students will get the right understanding of what their learning if it was taught from their home online. Say If I were to be schooled online from home, sure it'll be easier but at the same time it would be harder for me because I always ask questions in class and im saying it'll be harder to explain because you can't just simple show your teacher your work and tell them to explain it. Students who play sports as well, I wrestle for the school team for the past 3 years I'm a junior now and up coming senior and school has effected my athletic life. How would being an athlete work anymore because in my opinion it wouldn't even matter because we don't even goto school anymore and just learn from online. Think about how much changing to online schooling would effects a perosns life because a current problem in the world right now is the coronavirus and schools are planning on doing schooling online as well. Think aboout all the seniors and up coming senions sports seasons that are coming up, they're all about to be ruined because of the virus and It's going to effect their life and mainl a path to a scholarship. I do consider somethings to be good about online schooling though not evenything is bad. I believe students who tend to wake up late are still able to just wake up and review what they missed in a seperate call/email talk with their teacher. In my own opinion I wouldn't mind it even though it'll effect how I learn because I would prefer 1 on 1 but I'd be able to adapt to it. A bonus to being schooled online it that you're in a comfortable place and you'll be able to relax easily due to the comfort of you're own home. A big problem I would actually have and some people might have as well is that some people don't have internet and they can't just do it from their phone because some people also don't have hotspot which would cause some problems. My opinion on being schooled from home is a very mixed opinion because there are a lot of pros and cons to it. My overall opinion is that I don't believe it would be a good idea because of how many problems there would be. It would be to take to much time and I know for a fact a lot of time would be wasted to try to fix problems if they did do online schooling. Say if there were some mistake on the classes in online schooling, they're just going to waste even more time on fixing it than they are actually teaching the students. That is my reason why I believe why online schooling would not be better than in person learning.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
282D1DEB08F3,"Everyone needs to learn, no matter your age, size, color. Every person is unique and therefore has a unique way of learning. Distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Which could be a great alternative for kids who don't deal well with school.

One good reason would be transportation, not everyone lives close to a school and can get someone to take them to school, or have a bus stop in range of their house. Depending in what grade you're in school can start very early. As a high school student myself, I have to get up at 5:30 in the morning just to catch the bus, and I still miss it some mornings.

Also, kids can be ruthless at times and relentless with their bullying. I've experienced it myself; I've seen kids bullied so badly they had to transfer schools.

School isn't for everyone, It's better for kids to have a suitable learning environment according to their needs and situations instead of having them suffer in a school that's not good for them. This is why distance learning is a great alternative and you should consider moving your son/daughter to it if necessary.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
1D0EC331D8F6,"School is a place where students are supposed to be able to learn information and grow as human beings. The main problem with school being a place where students must commute to, is that for some of the students, the environment just isn't the right place for them to learn. Personally, I believe that for some students, learning from home may be a much more beneficial method of schooling. The reasons for this are: some students feel uncomfortable with the school environment and online school could allow for more freedom in class pacing.

A school in it's own can sometimes feel much too clinical for students, too professional, and way too pressuring of an environment. This is why for some students, it may actually be better if they learn from home. For me at least, I find school to be a suffocating environment, where you are surrounded by the pressure of other students and other teachers. One wrong move and your grade could be failing, and you have to face your teacher with that fact. The way I see it, that is way too much pressure to put on a student, for them to feel scared in an environment that is supposed to feel nurturing and calm. Instead, school feels like a prison, and the strict rules and guidelines are what push students to fail. This is why I believe that if students work from home, they will feel much more relaxed, and thus will do much better in classes. Students have a comfort zone, and sometimes a school building and environment crosses that comfort zone, which causes for poor performance. If school was taught from home or online, students would feel more comfortable and thus would do better.

If school was taught online, student would be able to control their class pacing much better than if it was taught in person. In a normal classroom, your teacher has a strict course schedule that he/she must keep to, and thus forcing students to keep to a strict routine of coursework. I can say this from my personal experience, since I too have dealt with the pressure of having multiple assignments due back to back, and having to turn them in on time or else my grade would suffer for my ignorance. Classes force students of differing levels of learning to all adapt to the same course schedule, with no room for fluctuation, and this is why their grades suffer. If school was to be taught from home or online, while there would still be due dates, it would not have to be as strict. Students could have more freedom to choose how their assignments are to get done and when they needed to be completed. Instead of being forced into some strict class schedule, students would have the rights and the freedom to choose, and I believe that you would see a great difference in their grades. This is why I will argue for school to be taught from home or online, since students would greatly benefit from it.

School should be taught from home or taught online, because I believe that most, if not all, students would benefit from it. Students would not have to deal with the harsh environment of a school and they would get ability to decide their class pacing better then in school teaching. I believe that all teachers want is for their students to succeed, but how can a student excel when the school system is dampening their motivations with poor environments. As a student myself, I can say with absolute certainty that I would benefit from having school from home. I would not have to feel the pressure of a harsh testing environment and I would never have to deal with teachers, who were frustrated that I could not complete their too many assignments on their due dates. Students need fluidity, and the rigid structure of our school system today is not helping them to succeed. The only way that I see that students would be able to act on full capacity would be to switch to a completely online school system. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DA86BC9B9FB6,"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn.

some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and don't concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that.

When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and don't putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and don't have distractions all year. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
6DF4B6E56381,"would you think is this inconvenient?

I would like to think the students has benefit from being able to attend classes from home. It would make the student confidence. They can save their time and money. It could help them to finish and graduate early.

First, It would make the students confidence. For instance, my friend Generic_Name was coming in the Generic_City. When she came in the United States she wasn't speak English well because English is her second language. When she was starting her class in the beginning of september her classmates started to bullying her for her accent. While she couldn't handle their bully and she was deciding to drop off her regular school and taking online classes. After couple weeks she was taking online classes in her home. She was doing really well and got confidence becuase her online classmates was bilingual students they were understood each of them.

Secondly, they can save their money and time. Generic_Name was working at church and at the same time he was taking college classes. He had big family. By the reason of his family he decided to quite to his college school because he hasn't enough time to taking face to face, he should take care of his family and he need to paid a lot of money for his credit. So, he decided to taking his online classes becuase he can got cheap online classes, he got full time job, he got enough time to study of his classes and for his family.

Finally, when I came in the United States I was wondering 12 grade but I need to some credit to graduate like History,Goverment and Art. If I would like to take those class in the one year I used to add some classes and I can't graduate early. So, when I talked my counslour she suggsted to me I need to take online class because If I'm talking those class in the one year they would gave to me elective classes. So, I don't need elective classes because I already had credit. So, I wondering to took those three classes in online

I finished and I graduated early in January 5.

Inconclusion, I would say It would help to get the diploma to easy way. It is the one of a good opportunity for students. It can solve the students problems. It could build own confidence. It can save the time and money.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
2A0B44CCA0CD,"The thought of being able to attend school without physically going to school is foreign to most. Recent technology innovations allow for school to become more accessible in many new ways. In some schools, students are able to participate in classes through use of the internet all without leaving the house. While many view this new form of learning as beneficial, the distractions of a home environment would create difficulties for the student as well as the lack of a personal connection with their teachers. Additionally, students would experience delayed social development by eliminating the connections made at school.

By substituting the school environment for the more comfortable home environment students would struggle staying focused on school work and lose the willingness to work as hard as they possibly could. Many educational professionals harp of the fact that students are less productive when work is done laying in bed as opposed to at a desk. Students generally lose focus when they are doing their work in a comfortable environment and become more inclined to relax or distract themselves with their smart phone or their

Netflix account. Physically attending classes limits the amount of distractions available to the student by isolating them to their desk eliminating their ability to freelance around their home. In addition, it is common for normal students to struggle focusing on homework assignments in their home and find they work much more effectively at places like the library or the local coffee shop.

Distance learning limits the student to a connection by way of a pixelated display which in many cases can make most students feel less connected to their teachers. Teachers are the people who shape the next generation of society and their impact of that next generation is reduced when they are not able to talk with their student in person. Bonds are more easily formed through face-to-face interaction. Teachers are probably one of if not the most important players in shaping the youth and they lose their ability to have that impact through distance learning. For example, it can be said that most adults who have completed school can name at least one teacher who has had a positive impact due to the bond that they shared. In some cases teachers can even replace the role of a father or mother figure in a student's life.

Distance learning students would also miss out on important development of social skills that most young people learn by attending school. The ability to form connections with other human beings is most likely one of the most helpful skills a single person could learn. Whether that ability helps them get a job interview or meet new and interesting people, their life can only benefit from possessing that skill. With that being said, lack of physical connection for distance learning students could put them further back in their development of social skills.

To conclude, students are better off physically attending school as opposed to online school because they can create important connections with teachers and develop their social skills and would be without the many distractions one experiences at home. However, there are students that do not have the ability to attend class regularly and for that reason, distance learning can be a great option for them. As the world becomes more digital it can be expected that many more innovations will change the way society approaches school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
FC79A21481C3,"Options and choices are one of the most important parts of school. Whether it be what classes to take or what school to attend, it is up to the student to decide what is best for them. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Being able to attend classes from home would be very beneficial to students in many ways, like allowing them to relax in the comfort of their homes or worry less about issues that may arise in a school setting. This could help students stay focused and invested in what is important to them and their future.

Schools start early in the morning. This requires students to wake up early in order to make it to school on time. This could end up being problematic for the students. Many students may have to stay up late the night before to finish homework. Others may not have enough time in the morning to eat breakfast. These issues can affect the student's performance at school. However, attending classes from home could resolve issues like these. By taking classes online, students would not have to worry about leaving the house. This would allow them time to get any food they might need before class or complete tasks ahead of time. This kind of time management is important for the health of the students.

Being around other students plays a big role in the everyday life of a public school student. Students see other students similar to them and different than them each day they are at school. There are nice students, however there are also students who discriminate towards others. There can be students who bully or make fun of others. This can be overwhelming for people, as they may struggle to fit in. For students like these, taking classes from home would be a perfect option. This would allow them to be safe at home without having to stress about what others may think about them or what they are wearing.

With that being said, there are some people who would disagree. Some may say this option can restrict interactions with other students, which could negatively impact a student's social life. While this statement does have some truth, it is not the whole story. Going to school online does mean that students will not be physically interacting with each other. However, the at home classes are supposed to give students the school experience, just from the comfort and safety of their home. Other students will have multiple ways of interacting with each other, like through online assignments. School is not the only place for students of the same age to get together and socialize. There are many opportunities just outside someone's door.

To close, the option to attend classes from home could be something great for students. It can provide a safe environment, as well as give them the time and space they may need to get things done. In a time where many things are done on the internet or online, there would be no better time to get invested in this new way of learning. The choice to take online classes could be a very beneficial experience for students that could change their future for the better.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F8ABE1CE8B68,"In an age of technology, schools are increasingly integrating computers, tablets, and cellphones into classroom use. People have been both against and for this new process, as they cause many distractions but also are thought to streamline the learning process. One new topic of debate is at home video conferencing in place for class at school. Students would be able to wake up in the morning, get on their devices, and attend class. However, I believe that students would not benefit from video conferencing at home because technical difficulties and distractions are common, and an engaging student to teacher or peer relationship is harder to maintain online than in reality.

Although computers and cell phones these days are already advanced compared to a couple of years ago, they are still not perfect. Technology is not very predictable, and this is not very beneficial to a person's learning. When students experience problems like no internet and glitches with their device, they will not be able to attend their class online. For example, if students were to wake up to a thunderstorm and find out that their power was out, they would have to take transportation all the way to their actual classroom while missing class time and content. Their education would be interrupted, contradicting the fact that video conferencing was supposed to make learning easier for them. These technical difficulties, while occasionally solvable at home, would be completely cut out at an actual school.

Being a student myself, I know for most that in a home environment, I feel far less focused than when I am at school. Pets, family, and simply things going on around the house are distracting while being taught new material and would be impairing a student's ability to retain new information and focus on the task at hand. Furthermore, if their parents were not at home, they would have to watch pets and take care of younger siblings while attending class at the same time. Also, teachers would not be able to control their students' internet or phone use at home. All of these distractions would cause focusing problems not usually found at school. This would not be beneficial to students' education and could also be avoided if students went to a physical school.

The last reason why students would not benefit from video conferencing at home is because it would lack an actual student to teacher or peer relationship. A teacher would have a hard time focusing on one student's question while trying to keep the attention of their entire class online. While answering a question of one student, the rest of the class could be leaving the conference. This relationship is hard to fake as teachers are supposed to be mentors for so many students. Forging lasting friendships with peers would also be difficult in on online setting where an entire class can hear your conversation. Since communication with others is a necessity at succeeding in jobs and in the real world, these conversations would be especially important to technology addicted teens. Without actual face to face contact, it will be hard for students to get real life experiences that can shape their futures. The video conferencing would contribute to this hardship rather than benefit the students through its constant internet use.

With technology already being such an important institution in students' lives, I do not think that they would benefit very much from using online conferencing in place of an actual classroom. These days there are rarely any boundaries between children and their phones or TV, and the longer they use them the more immersed they become in other people's lives rather than their own. Real life interaction with teachers and peers simulate real world experiences for students, and they learn important communication and team working skills there. But video conferencing at home basically contradicts everything that school is meant to be. Rather than establishing a focused environment where children can learn from physical teachers and peers, it makes school an artificial and imaginary thing that has a far more diminished role in students' lives than real school. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
06EC785D1238,"At home learning can be beneficial because if you don't want to wake up to early to catch the bus, you can schedule a meeting with a teacher at any given time. If you are sick, something happened to a family member or your on vacation you will still get instruction online. Long distance classes can be helpful because you can find a class that works for you, lets say there was a teacher that you don't like you can just change teachers, and it would be easier to switch than public or private schools. Test taking would be a lot easier as well, you can use your notes and set up a day when you can take it online.

Taking online classes can be more helpful because it would help you relive some stress, like if you are meeting with teachers online stress might end up being less then at an sitting down in an actual school and trying to get everything done. You can also make your own time of day that you want to have a conference with your teacher, you could meet before breakfast, after lunch or even before dinner. You and your teachers can talk for awhile and they would be focusing on you and not other students, only giving you their full attention. You can ask the teachers for help its like they are doing a one on one tutoring and only your learning new material and it is every day. You and your teacher can also talk about what times would work best and how long you want the classes to be.

Taking online school classes can not only be helpful but they can help students who are struggling a lot, like if you missed something you can ask your teacher to go back and not feel embarrassed in from asking questions. Sometimes when students don't understand what the teacher is saying students don't ask because they don't want all the the attention on them. To be called on or asked questions sometimes give people anxiety or like they are scared to answer the question, however taking an online classes there will be less anxiety and more confidence.

However taking online classes has some downs as well, you probably won't get as much information as taking a regular school class. You probably won't have as many friends because you don't actually go to a private or public school. You probably have less time to do things with other people because you are taking an online class. If you fall behind things might get harder you will have little tutoring and if it isn't a one on one meeting and you don't understand you might not get as much help as you need.

Online tutoring can be helpful and can help you get on the right track of you wanting to do something really cool when you finish school. However making a schedule could be hard and if your not doing a one on one tutoring it might get hard but if you really concentrate and work hard in school you can accomplish a lot more than you think. It counts on you and what you want to do, public, private, or online school it's up to you and how you want to do with your education. What will you choose?",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EDEA70DE2D47,"Everyone can agree that students have to learn someway or another; it's very essential in preparing for life after school and as an adult. It's also safe to say that one person may learn best one way, while another person may learn better in a different manner. That can bring up the argument of: which is better: online classes at home, or being in a physical classroom? While there may be benefits to learning through online classes, it's a lot more beneficial to take classes at an actual school. Students wouldn't benefit from being able to take classes from home because being inside a classroom environment is helpful, there aren't as many hands on activities for students that take online classes, and there isn't very much socializing that takes place.

To begin with, learning inside of an actual classroom environment is extremely helpful to the students. For one, teachers are willing to stay after school to assist or tutor any students that may be struggling in class. Whenever a teacher takes the time to do something like this for a student, it really helps the student in future assignments, and it helps them to grasp the subject area better than before. However, if these students that needed assistance were taking online classes, there wouldn't be much that they could do because they wouldn't have the opportunity of having a teacher stay after school to help them. To further expand on this idea, it's also very helpful to students whenever they can actually see the work that is being done and to hear it being explained by their teacher. If these students were taking at home classes, the only explanations that would be getting are the words that are on their screens whenever they begin a new assignment. Being able to actually hear someone explain and show the physical process of something being done makes a very influential difference in a students learning.

Furthermore, there aren't very many opportunities to do hands on activities for students that take online classes. Considering the fact that everything the student does would be online, the only ""hands on"" activities that they can do are virtual. While this may not be that big of a problem, it's still very important in some classes to have hands on activities, such as chemistry. With chemistry, there are a lot of labs that the students do that help them to further understand and analyze the information that they're learning, but if the student is taking an online chemistry class, they wouldn't get the chance to do these labs. Additionally, if students don't get the chance to move around and do hands on activities, it can end up demotivating them and cause them to lose interest in the material. The best solution for this is to have them inside of an actual classroom environment to which they can actually learn and stay interested in the subject.

Lastly, students that take at home classes will quickly recognize that there isn't much socializing to do. Since everything that these students do is online, the only socializing that they get to do is with their teacher, which is likely through email. While this lack of communication may not seem that big of a deal, it's extremely important to socialize, especially at younger ages, as it helps students with development. If students are only exposed to a computer screen for their younger years in life, then they will likely have difficulties in being social with others later on into adulthood. Additionally, these students may begin to feel isolated from other students their age due to not being able to socialize very much. Because of something like this, it greatly impacts one's mental health, and the best way to fix this kind of situation is to have the students learn at an actual school. By doing so, it allows them to learn better, and it allows them to socialize with other students their age, and not just their online teacher.

To finalize, it's evident that allowing students to take classes at home isn't very beneficial to them. While being able to take online classes may allow them to work at their own pace to ensure they get good grades, it's ultimately better for students to learn in a more social environment that allows them to participate in activities that help to further their understanding of a subject. Also, by allowing students to learn in an actual classroom setting, it sets them up for adulthood by utilizing much more than online classes do. Essentially, at home classes really end up just harming a students future as it takes a lot away from a student. With that being said, it's a lot better to have students attend classes at school, and not at home. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
979F330774B9,"Students in some schools are being offered distance learning by taking classes from home as an option of their education and I do not think they are going to gain educational benefits from it because of a-lot of reasons.

Firstly, I do not think they would benefit from distance learning is because almost all students have distractions at home. For example, if a student is home taking a class online, they will mostly have a distraction like a phone which will distract them a-lot from focusing and studying which can effect their grades a-lot as well.

Secondly, they would not benefit because a teacher is very important for every class. For example, If a student needs extra help, they would need someone to help them like a teacher. If a teacher is right there with the student to help, the student can get all his questions answered easily. Some students need extra help with their assignments.

Lastly, in my last reason I would say, they would not benefit from it because they are going to miss out all extra school activities and not be able to volunteer in anything. For example, football games or theme week in high school are so much fun for students to create so many fun memories to look back at to in the future. All students should experience these activities in their high school life to create enjoyable memories for their future.

This is why I think students would not benefit from distance learning education and it should not be optional unless the student or their family has an acceptable reason for the student to take their classes online. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
DA757F0B202B,"Yes, I do think that students would benefit from learning online or by video conference. The reason being because it gives students a chance to choose how they wanna learn and which way works best for them. By giving students this opportunity, it could mostly likely engage students to learn. It gives them more then one option to choose from.

Many students around the world have probably been in a situation where they couldn't have one on one time with a teacher. Therefore, it caused them to do bad on a test/quiz or even fail. By giving students the option to video conference, it gives students a chance to ask more questions and to be more clear on things they don't understand. Everyone has a different pace on how they learn and process new information.

Another reason why it would be beneficial is because some students are born with disabilities or they can't walk as good. So for them it might be harder to get to places or even do anything. Which is why I think online classes are a good idea, because it doesn't allow them to do much. But they're still getting the same amount of education as someone who does go to school.

One of my last reasons are because of bullying. Bullying is one of the most common things to happen at school. The reasons people bully are because of how someone looks/dresses and if they're dumb or not. That being said, online classes are a good way for kids that get made fun of, to still get the same learning experience as others, just without the hurtful comments or actions.

I respect other peoples point of view by thinking they won't really benefit from anything. Because if you think about it, some students will take advantage and use it to their own power. Some students will go as far to cheating so they could have a good grade. Which at the end will be bad for them because they won't benefit from anything. However, they won't get to do school activities such as school dances, pep rallies and even get to watch sports games.

In conclusion, I think that students could really benefit from it, because it gives them an opportunity to try it out and see if it works for them. Some people might have there doubts, but overall it's a good option to have. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
209EE46FB0BB,"Over time, traditional schooling has evolved drastically. The standard one room school houses that were once prevalent in the 1900's, have now turned into massive buildings, often having more than one floor and schooling up to 1,000 students a year. Due to the many ways education has evolved, it is important to be able to accommodate the needs of various students. With new advancements in technology, many options are now available for students who are unable attend school due to their circumstances. Programs such as Google Classroom and Vision make online learning easier and accessible for both students and teachers. All schools should offer some form of distance learning because of the benefits of ease of access, self paced learning, and learning how to become independent.

Famous teenagers are known to benefit significantly from distance learning. Many of these teenagers are often traveling to different countries and various events, so traditional school timings are not acquirable. Due to the introduction of using technology to learn from home, famous teenagers as well as other students no all have access to an education no matter where they are. The same goes for students who live in completely rural farming towns with schools that require most a 30 minute commute. Depending on where a person might live, the school closest to them can be as far as 10 miles away or more. These students are able to benefit from taking classes at home because they are more easily accessible, in turn enticing the students to attend online conferences and finish school. The major benefits of this would be the students having access to learn from the comfort of their homes despite any hardships that deter them from attending school.

Learning from home also allows a student to learn at their own pace. In traditional school setting theres a 90 minute interval of learning subject and then switching classes to learn subject. This limits a student from being able to spend time in class to learn material. Having classes that a student could attend form home would allow the students to keep their classes self paced . Say that a student is feeling bombarded with work after having 4 classes within 8 hours a day in a traditional school setting. Offering classes through distance learning would allow the student to decide when to take which class as well as how much time to spend on the subject. Without allotted times and restrictions just like traditional school offers, the amount of time spent on learning material will help the students encode the information and retain it more easily and effectively. Attending classes at home also allows the student to adjust their schedules accordingly. Whereas most high schoolers go to school from 9:15am -4:03pm, and then arrive to their jobs at 5 pm, working late into the evening, having classes at home can eliminate having less time do homework, sleep, and extracurricular. A student who is taking classes at home might prefer to go to work early in the morning and start their classes around 3 pm and spend more time on a certain subject. Allowing students to attend classes from home gives them the ability to chose their own work paces as well as accommodate to their own learning styles.

Students learning from classes online and at their own paces would be benefit greatly by learning how to become independent and self efficient. The traditional school setting motivates you to get assignments turned in due to deadlines and learn due to emphasis from teachers and their peers. Taking classes from home can either cause a student to become extremely disorganized and lazy, or learn how to effective rely on themselves to manage time wisely and get tasks done like mature young adult. Allowing for students to take part in learning from home through online classes will keep them in charge and accountable for their education. It will also work to prepare them for the next phase in life, college. Since more academic freedom is given in college, learning how to balance time wisely through taking classes at home, will help better prepare students for the future. Distance learning will prompt students to come up with schedules catered to their needs and wants in order to work towards earning good grades and accomplishing tasks.

There are numerous benefits to introducing distance learning for students in traditional schools. Being able to take classes at home willl allow many schools to accomodate to the various needs of their students. Many students will be able to enhance their learning through working on course material at home and becoming more independent in their lives. Students will also be able to take classes wherever and whenever needed, encouraging all students to finish school. Thanks to the advancements in technology and teaching methods, having classes accessible at home on and off campus allow for students to easily participate in school, learn how to take control of their learning, and prepare for the future. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
B4DEA93DAA5B,"Today's modern technology is advancing at a faster rate each year and we use it in our everyday lives and helped us in so many ways. Why shouldn't they help us with education?

Technology should be more widely accepted and used in academic settings, as they have many benefits. They have the ability to make learning more engaging, lessons to be more accessible, and overall convenient in certain situations for some people.

Distance learning is an amazing concept and should be offered more in schools, and there are several reasons why it should. Many students with long term illnesses or injuries are not able to attend school because of their current situation. It can result in a negative effect on their academic abilities and may take a toll on their graduation requirements, thus, may prevent them from doing so.

There are also students who have trouble getting to school or are not able to attend school traditionally. Online schooling would be very convenient in their case. They wouldn't have to worry about getting to classes on time and can learn at their own pace.

Distance learning is amazing, but most great ideas can have negative components. Even though technology is advancing, that doesn't mean it's completely flawless. There can be technological issues, for example, the device not being able to connect to the internet properly. There can also be distractions in home settings. Family members, especially young children, can disrupt your attention. And tempting activities like video games and television can do so too. But these problems can easily be fixed compared to the ones that prevents certain students from attending. The positives easily outshines the negatives in this case.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
72DF5D84477A,"Many students prefer to attend online classes to improve their knowledge. Why they choose online classes instead go to school everyday? There are many benefit and reasons they prefer online classes. Firstly distraction in classroom, students use to distract with others friends in class while the teacher is talking. Secondly the transportation is very important because a lot of students live far away from school. Finally taking online classes students get the same credit as taking the class inside the school.

In many schools, students have the option to choose online classes or classes in school. Firstly the benefit of taking online classes is students are able to do their work without distraction of their friends. For example, when the teacher is explaning the concept in the classroom some students like to talk and disctract others in classroom. However in online classes is only the teacher and there are not students distracting others in the class. Secondly students can ask any question about the concept of the class to the teacher. For example in class there is always something that students don't understand really well.

During the last decade students have been distractived with many king of technology like cellphones and video games on computer. But some schools also are taking advantage of this technology by offering online classes and creating opportinies to learn from home. Students can watch videos about explanation of classes on their phones. Basically this opportunity is helping many students give them knowledge and preparing them to the future.

The most important thing about online classes is that students get their credit as they were taking the regular class. Last year I had two option to choose, the first option was go to an academy to learn about marketing. The second option was take the online course from the academy. So this opportunity is great for everyone because students can improve their knowledge with online course and we still get the regular credit as we take the class in the academy.

Another benefit is in video conferencing the students can go back anytime they need in the video. In the other hand the students do not worry about transportation. Since many students arrive late to school they are not there when the teacher is giving the explanation to the class. Because the bus arrive late to school. In rural areas the schools are far away from the studen's home. So taking online classes they don't worry about it. Because all they need to do is log in their computer and to the class.

In conclusion, online classes is a great option to students. Studesnts get the same credit as taking the class in the school. Also there is not transportation to worry or the trafic to arrive late to school. Lastly there is not distraction in online class. Also the online class count as the regular class of the school. Finally there were some benefit that students get when they enroll in online classes. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
907B493FEF99,"It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes. Distance learning gives students a more customized and adaptive learning experience while giving students more time to engage in the extracurriculars they love.

One way distance learning is beneficial for students is because it allows students to customize their classes. For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students.

Another benefit to learning from home is that it gives students more time to focus on their needs and wants rather than the schools. In certain cases when student prodigies are more focused on a sport, a musical instrument or a job, learning from home can grant students more time to perfect their craft. Online learning allows them to have their primary focus being on what they love rather than on a rigorous and time wasting traditional school day. Another example is in the case of a student that does not thrive in a the social aspect of school. Sometimes kids feel overwhelmed and threatened by the large amount of students in one school. In order to feel comfortable, kids could video conference into school and learn from the comfort of their own home. School can be long and sometimes overwhelming so in certain cases distance learning can be beneficial.

Learning is essential to grow as an individual but also as a population and with new technology, accomadating for certain needs is easy and beneficial. Distance learning is a way for students to customize when and what they want to learn as well as feel comfortable and adapt to their needs. Distance learning is a thing of the future that will soon benefit many. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7443D525E32D,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

The American Education System has grown a lot since it was originally curated. While I do believe there have been positives to have come from today's educational system, I also believe there are improvements that can be made. One important improvement would be the ability to attend classes online. I believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home, due to the style of today's stress-inducing form of schooling.

First of all, this would be very beneficial because attending classes from home would help relieve stress from students with social anxieties or anxieties involving the typical school format. The stress levels of students has grown exponentially in the passed couple of decades, and I've seen it first hand. Students are growing more and more anxious as the expectations to get good grades, get into a good school, and follow a career in STEM become higher. How are we to expect our students handle these sort of worries while also trying to balance a social life? My younger sister has aspired to be many things; including a doctor, a biologist, and even a detective. But do to her hyper-thyroidism she has been held back by her medical testings and re-diagnosis' during the school year. This has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety--but after many meetings and emails between my parents and the school, she was accommodated with home bound. Home bound is a form of at-home schooling that allows her to take some classes from home and work with teachers outside of school hours in order to help her get caught up.

Second of all, attending classes from home would allow for more flexibility when it comes to the scheduling of classes, and potentially assignment deadlines. If a student struggles to balance school, extra-curricular activities, and a job, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work a job in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule.

Lastly, attending classes from home would allow for more involvement of the parent in the students education. Some parents do not get a full scope of what is going on in a students school day, and it can sometimes be hard for kids to communicate this to their parents. Some parents tend to job the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isn't doing too well, but what they aren't always considering is the other factors that go into it. A students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus, but how well a teacher is teaching them, and the sort relationships between other kids in the class. If a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses, they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns. Not only that, but the student would have less distractions from other kids, and hopefully be able to avoid some of the flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching.

Now while I do believe others would combat my claim with statements such as, ""today's educational system has done amazing and has left many students with successful careers in medicine and engineering"". But to that I would say; there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist, Albert Einstein and entrepreneur, Gary Vee, who either dropped out of high school or didn't find themselves doing so great until university. That is why I believe students would benefit very well from attending classes from home, to help relieve the stress of today's school system. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9A40D1576A1E,"Online Schooling

The concept of online schooling is very simple work at home ask questions later. It is something we agree with because it is really only beneficial to those who dont have the resources or tools anyway. It presents itself with being very universal and outgoing and comfortable because who wouldnt wanna learn new things in the comfort of their own home. However, It is a factor that revolves around endless distractions, little too none human interaction ,and very little visual an guided learning.

Being a teen parent doing online courses sounds so day filling and convenient but being a regular student very average with distractions and new task every where you go. For students distraction is always near and it is hard too not get distracted. Lets say your family just flew in its a week before the holiday an you want too do what they are doing like go to the movies or wrestle or play on your new Xbox. School work or online courses would not be on your mind which would cause more people to fall behind in there courses. Distractions are a factor in anything presented too you For example, your teacher hands u a piece of paper and says write your name while they are talking you might lean over and talk too the person next too you about the paper or get on your phone and miss the instructions that were given.

Human interaction is some what needed to preform any task although, If you are anything like me then you like too be shown how too do everything given and you will need an explanation after every thing that they are showing you .Human interaction is the quickest reply you will ever get and man to man and skin too skin contact is a way too keep from becoming antisocial . Working at home might cause you too feel like you dont need anyone too help you an you might just wanna be alone all the time . Most of the time people will develop early on issues because they feel that the help they needed was not provided during this stage or process. I know some of you are probably thinking that they have parents why cant they just help them however, not everyone is provided with that option what if there parents did not graduate or what if they did not further their education. This why public schooling or private schooling should be put into action and thought about

Online courses are not specified too those that need visuals and need too visualize before completing an action. Visual learning also goes with human interaction it is something that helps us succeed in the real world. In the real world in order too ask questions or in order to get a job you have too complete a face too face interview. The world is starting too become more and more lenient on the concept and the uses of technology. But, No one is going too hire someone with un-professional attire too become there lawyer its not really acceptable in the place of business due too the views ,perceptions and, standards of the world. The way you dress or look in your home is different then when you leave your home they will not learn these real world skills because they werent taught and didnt develop those characteristics like everyone else.

In conclusion, Online schooling or online courses are only truly beneficial too those that need it and those that are doing it due to circumstance and it should not be encouraged amoungst those that do not have a great amount of self control and self reliance. Without those skills and without interpersonal skills they will not succeed and they will not learn daily life skills. it seems very simple but it is not and should not be treated as such. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
353CAC9AC658,"Not all students are the same and their varied conditions may affect their opportunity to obtain an education. Distance learning is a new innovative technique that some schools implement to offer online education at home. This technique can be offered in many ways such as: online video, conferencing, and online courses. Distance learning can be very beneficial for all students in any level of education. I think that students should be given the opportunity to obtain distance learning because it can be very convenient for students who suffer from illnesses and can't attend school, it allows students to work at their own pace, and it allows students to work when it is mostly convenient for them.

Implementing distance learning can decrease the attendance issue most schools face. Students miss school due to many factors; One of the main reasons why students miss schools is due to illnesses. Students who deal with very severe illnesses such as cancer are forced to not attend school for long periods of time. Which can hinder the student's future. Even illnesses that aren't very severe can still negatively affect students because most illnesses can be easily transmitted, such as the common cold, which can put other students' health at risk. To prevent this issue schools should offer distance learning by allowing the students to attend classes from anywhere whether it's their homes or hospitals. Students who suffer from health problems don't have to miss out on their education and get the same opportunity to learn like every healthy student.

Distance learning also allows students to work at their own pace which can be an advantage to students; Specially to those who have learning disabilities. Teachers work at the same pace with every student. Which isn't helpful for students as their minds work differently and their comprehension levels vary. Some students learn slower than others and most teachers don't recognize that. With distance learning each student can learn at the pace that is appropriate for them. Distance learning is also very helpful as the teacher's focus shifts to each individual student rather than the class as a whole. Online conferencing allows the teacher to understand the student more and asses their abilities. This helps teachers divide students based on what learning techniques is appropriate for them. Which can result in increased student performance.

Distance learning is very beneficial for students as they have the option to work when they are motivated and when it is convenient for them. Most students attend school with less than 5 hours to sleep due to sleeping late because of homework. Students who have the opportunity to work from home don't have to wake up early. Distance learning allows students to do online courses when they are energized, which doesn't have to be in the morning. This can improve the student's efficiency level and improve their performance. Not all students' physiological needs are met yet they are expected to work with no breaks during school hours. This is due to school hours not being enough for teachers to cover all the content that needs to be covered. Distance learning allows students to take breaks when they feel the need to. Giving students this autonomy can be more motivating to them.

Overall students' conditions vary from student to student. Each student is unique in that they have different minds and thinking levels. Which is why i believe that distance learning is a very innovative and useful technique that should be provided by all schools as learning option for students. Distance learning provides many opportunities for all students because it can is very useful for students who are sick and can't attend school, it can be helpful for students as they are working at their own pace, and it allows students to work whenever is convenient to them.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
ADDAA9A7EB90,"Take distance classes would be a good option for students to finish their education and help to support they family.

In the actuality many schools offer distance learning as an option for students to finish their education. For my part i think this is a good idea because this benefits a lot students that they have jobs or have others activities that don't let them to assist at regular classes. Taking classes online or by video conference permit people to continue and finish with their studies and jobs. In this country a lot of people need to get a jobs to help their family because their don't have economic stability or many young people they have to take care of their siblings while their parents are working. Many young people left the school to take jobs or because their don't have enough money to pay for their full education.

sometimes their are independent and don't have any person who support them. Taking online classes benefit them because they have time to attend their jobs and can continue with their studies also they can have enough time to finish their homework, more time to study and do other activities like play sports or take care of their brothers or sisters when their parents are working. They don't have to came at school or wait for late buses to pick them at school each morning, brings the possibility to course any carrier of their interest with just click a bottom from a computer of the commodity of their home. Online classes offers facilities like to take whatever course that your are interested in that save time to travel to school or change school because they don't have available that course that you are interested in, also helps to improve computer skills and concentration.

Although some may believe otherwise students should be able to attend classes from home because of chronic illnesses, other health issues, and some may learn better that way.

Some students may have chronic illnesses that require them to either be in the hospital or at home. Most people with chronic issues have good or bad days, when someone has a bad day they might not even be able to get out of bed let alone going to school. My neighbor was diagnosed with Chrons disease when she was in high school, she was in and out of the hospital for those 4 years. She missed so much school but had no way of being there because they did not have personal laptops . She missed out on so much school and had to transfer to Generic_School to be able to graduate on time. Some may believe that it is students responsibility to make it to class everyday without fail but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is not physically possible with most chronic illnesses. My cousin Generic_Name had Lyme disease her senior year of high school and missed 7 months of school due to complications with the disease and was unable to walk. She had to take her senior year over again because this technology was not available to her. It is impossible for people with chronic illnesses to make it to school everyday.

When there is a health crisis some student may not be able to make it to school. In a world such as today there are so many things going on, such as the Corona virus. Many students will not be able to come to class because of existing health problems that weaken their immune system. There is a student named Generic_Name who has severe asthma and has been hesitant to come to school because if she were to contract the Corona virus it would be detrimental to her health as her lungs are already compromised. Some may believe that students should still have to go to school because there is no real harm in getting the virus but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that if someone has a preexisting medical condition that weaken their immune system the Corona virus will take a massive toll on them and coming to school will defiantly not be feasible then. For example anyone that has died from the corona virus so far has had preexisting medical conditions that have only been made worse with the introduction of the virus.

Some students do not learn well in a classroom setting which in turn can make their grades plummet. Some student learn in different ways, some may be a visual learner and some may only learn things be doing it. When I was a freshman I was home schooled for the first part of the year but after failing all of my classes because there was no online work, it was only from a textbook, I went back to public school and excelled because most of the credits I was had to make up were online classes for English and history. I finished the online courses in a week when I had third and fourth quarter to finish them. Some may believe that students should be able to learn in any environment but this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that not all students are the same. One of my siblings, Generic_Name, writes very colorful and neat notes because this is the way her mind will remember the information better. Another one of my siblings, Generic_Name, loves to read books, so if it is in a book she will remember it. Most students learn in different ways.

In the past people have not been mindful of how other people learn and what other people are affected by, but I hope that in the future people will be accepting of their differences and work with them to make sure they are working to the best of their ability without being discriminated against. Students should be able to attend classes from home because of chronic illnesses, other health concerns, and some may learn better this way.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
37B0303FA993,"Almost a 30% of high school students have more responsibilities than others, such as pay bills, and start saving money for college. Some schools are offering distance learning as an option for students, which means that they could attend classes from home by online or by video conferencing. Students think that they would get benefits by being able to attend this program. The truth is that students will not get benefits by attending this program because they will have more responsibilities, less social life, and more access to social media.

By attending this program students will have more responsibilities than they usually do, since they will have more time to spend working or doing other things, they will easily forget about if they have homework or projects to do. Even though, some students will get what they actually want, it will not be the same for them, because if they do not understand something, it will not going to be the same to ask a teacher than to ask an online teacher. However, students that want to attend this program will always have to be thoughtful about what things they need to be doing, and what things are more important than others.

Also students will have less social life, doing this program they will not have many friends as they could have attending regular school, and if they have there is a huge possibility that they will not have the same age and they will not be always on the same path or alike. Thus, they will not have many friends to do enjoyable things, or someone to share great things with, and it will be hard for them to get used to this program.

Last, students will have more access to social media, during the time that they are taking online classes or video conferencing they have to be using a laptop or a desk computer, and also internet. Using a computer and internet will lead them to have access to social media during classes, and it will be a distraction for them, because they will not be putting complete effort to their classes.

Although, students will have more time to be doing exactly want, such as work, and hobbies. It will not going to be the same because they will not have many friends as they would like to have to do and share amazing things.

In conclusion, taking online classes or by video conferencing, it will never going to be the same that attend a regular school, because students will have more responsibilities than they used to, at one point they will feel lonely, and they will not be putting complete effort because they will have more access to social media during classes.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
07C49C9E6178,"Learning what you will need to be successful later from your own home sounds awesome! Some schools offer students to learn at home from online classes or video conferencing with teachers and educational professionals. Having students attend school at home is a benefit because they can receive more help, they are able to focus more on school, and have more time to do things that interest them.

First, Students benefit from learning at home because they can receive more help that they need. When we are working alone and need help it is easier to receive one-on-one help. Also, not having others around you makes it easier to ask as many questions as you need to without having to interrupt someone else or to be rushed cause someone else has a question. Being able to ask questions one-on-one also helps so people do nt make fun of you for things you need help with. You are also able to go over your notes as many times as you need to before taking a quiz or test to make sure you understand. Also you can highlight and make you notes easy for you to understand things easily. Therefore learning at home helps you to do better and to get help that you need when you need it.

Secondly, getting your education at home helps you to focus on school more when u are in a small learning environment. Focusing becomes easier with a quieter place, which you are given when you are at home, compared to a class room with 20-30 students in it. When completing assignments you have the time you need to complete it and the time to focus so you do well and to look over it. Having people there to bother you is no longer a problem when you are at home learning because it is just you along with your family not a bunch of people. Focusing on your education so you can succeed later on down the road is a very important thing and learning at home gives the focus to you.

Finally, being able to work from home gives you more time to do things that you like to do. With being at home working you get to work on your own pace and get a lot or a little done at anytime within your deadlines. You are also able to do work at anytime or any day of the week because it is up to you when you work as long as it is done within the time frame given to you. Having time to spend with family and to do things like sports or hanging out with your friends is very important to you mental and emotional health and the time is made when you do work at home. Learning at home has made it easier for you to get time to do things that you enjoy but you get school done as well.

However, some say that learning through online classes or through video conferencing does not help the student learn what they will need to get the knowledge they will need for the real world. Students are not learning enough at home because they have easier access to looking up the answers or to someone telling the answers instead of being able to show the knowledge they know in the topic. But, others say that learning from the confront of your own home helps you do better and then you do not have to worry about how long you take and how much time that you take to review so that you are well prepared. Students receive their education through learning online just as well as they do sitting in a classroom.

In conclusion, schools should allow students to learn from distance classes such as online or through video conferencing. Having education options for students at home helps them to get more help whenever they need it, they are able to focus better, and to have more time to do things them enjoy. Everyone needs the option to help themselves do better. Let students learn wherever they will do the best and can succeed in life.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
F5D4904B0155,"Many people have experiences that they remember in life. That could be from the first date to a trip to the Bahamas. But little do they cherish their time in school. Schools have gone from being a class taught by a teacher to being at the fingertips on a digital device, but do these devices benefit or hurt the growing generation. Schools have been successful at giving opportunities for all students like collaborative work, hands-on experiences, and the ability to have one-on-one communication between a teacher and the student.

One reason why classroom setting education is beneficial is because of the collaboration among friends. Students tend to enjoy their education much better when they have friends to share it with. The classroom is an environment where students can work on activities together and share their knowledge. It is also good for students to take breaks every once in a while and to communicate with their friends so that they can refresh and get back to learning. Collaboration is something that is generally not found in online classes and causes the student to lose interest in the class. When students have the opportunity of working with peers, it increases their interest and productivity as a result of having a classroom education.

Another benefit to the classrooms is the hands-on experience it includes. Students show more interest in classes that provide selections of activities that go with the topic that is being taught. Schools provide enjoyable experiences that lead to better student development. Students do not enjoy the aspect of repetitive and tiring labor while studying for online courses. Hands-on and entertaining activities add to the excitement of learning in classes.

The final reason that working in classrooms is beneficial is that students can work with their teachers. With online classes, there is a lack in there being people that can help educate an individual person. Classes allow teachers to learn about their students, figure out their weaknesses, and help each one individually. With online courses, students do not often have answers to their questions that they need; sure, maybe they can search the Web, but they do not have somebody that can interpret information so that it can be remembered. In order for students to have improved success, students need one-on-one help from their teachers.

Even though it may be true that online classes can provide more time to study and to learn, classrooms in schools provide a better learning environment over the alternative online classes. Opportunities from schools like collaborative work, classroom activities, and help from teachers provide a better learning environment that bring better success out of students. Online classes may not be providing the correct balance of interest and help that drive success in students. Keeping classrooms like they have been will progress the growing generations to be as successful as past generations because of the great public education that is has been in place. Before applying for online courses, is this the experience you want? ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
04BC78F95F4A,"Imagine if there was an option to get a quality education without the need to actually go to school, imagine not having to deal with crowded hallways, obnoxious students, or blaring school bells. Actually, there is an option like that. Some schools offer the option of allowing students to attend school online by video conferencing or by being in an online class. This has sparked a debate with people wondering whether this option of taking online classes is beneficial to students or not. One side of the argument says that taking online classes is beneficial because it's convenient and there will be less negative social interactions between students. The other side of the argument states that students taking online classes is not beneficial because students will have less social interaction all together and because technology shouldn't be relied on so much when it comes to an education. I believe that getting an education online is not beneficial to students because of the lack of social interaction and because technology shouldn't be the most crucial object for a student's education.

Firstly, online classes aren't helpful because students who take online classes do not get the same social needs met as a student that physically goes to school. A student in an online class will have a lesser chance of meeting others. Meeting people and making friends is one the key aspects of going to school, besides getting an education, and students and kids need to be meeting people and learning how to interact with others. Humans are social creatures, we need to be talking, seeing, and meeting with people. If kids are built on rarely communicating with others, then there will be a higher chance of them being more socially anxious as young adults. Another reason why a student that goes to school online will not have their social needs met is because they won't experience arguments as much. While there is positive interaction, there is also negative interaction. As terrible as it feels when people experience it, a rare argument is actually good. It teaches kids what is accepted and what isn't by the way that the person reacts to it. For example, you get in trouble and scorned if you have a physical fight with someone after an argument, But if you react to an argument in good fashioned way then you will get praised and nothing bad will come your way. Furthermore, if a student that takes online classes gets a job where they are met with a negative interaction, they might not react in a way another student might. Lastly, people going to an online school will not get the same social interaction from teachers. While students that go to school have a teacher that is physically there to help, online students do not. This might make online schooling harder for the student because they won't have that same interaction with a teacher as a regular student would have. Plus, not having a teacher there next to you to show you how to do something might be hard for most students. So, online schooling is not beneficial to students because they will have limited social interactions like meeting and connecting with others, not experiencing negative social interactions, and not having the same social help with teachers.

Lastly, online classes aren't beneficial to students because technology has limits. There is always a risk of damaging the laptop a student is using to take the online classes. Accidents happen, but while the laptop is getting fixed the student will most likely start to fall behind on work. An accident shouldn't be a reason for someone beginning to fail a class. Another reason why technology is limited is because of internet and wifi. Some students may not have access to good internet and wifi because of their home and living situation, this will just make video conferencing more of a hassle than a helpful. Finally, the technology that the kids use for the online classes might be used irresponsibly. Some might use it to play games or watch videos, teens will be like that. Online schooling is not helpful because of technology limits like broken tech, not everyone has access to wifi, and others might not use it for it's intended purpose.

Some people may argue that online classes are good for students because of lack of negative interaction and its convenience. Bullying and fights can really harm students, I agree with that statement. But learning behind a computer screen shouldn't be the solution we choose. We can try to improve the school system or promote telling teachers and trusted ones if someone is getting bullied. Just because there is negative interaction doesn't mean we should limit interaction entirely. Also, the convenience not going on the school bus everyday and walking through loud hallways is compelling. That is also a fair point, but, charging chrome books everyday and running the risk of it breaking isn't any more convenient than a crowded hallway. Despite these points, I still believe that online classes are not helpful to students because we can better the school system with bullying problems and charging and always running the risk of damaging something isn't convenient.

Online classes are not beneficial to students because of the lack of social interactions and because of the fact that technology has limits. Students physically going to school is great for their well being, getting to interact with and make bonds with people is important in our daily lives. Technology shouldn't be used as the only mean to education, while technology can play an important role to a student's education, it should not be the main object to do so. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
7172C3C82401,"Many people or specially teenager around the world does not have the opportunity to go to the school because some of them need to work to pay their bills and what they need. This is a great idea for all of those teenager because they can be able to attend classes from their home and learn after work,but the mos important thing is that they should get education. In my opinion is too bad for those teenager who have the opportunity to have their parents which means that they pay all their bills and what they need. For those teenager is bad idea because they have all the time to go to the school and learn faster than those who did not have the opportunity.

First, for those teenager who live in the United State is very difficult to attend the school because some of them came here to work. However, they have the age to be and attend the school but they were to force to work because most of them support their family in their country. In my opinion this offer that some schools are giving is an amazing idea because now they can learn from home by online or video conferencing. The school is very important for the human becuase nowaday if you have more education your value is higher but if you don't have education in this country your value is very low. Therefore, these people need to make good use of these big opportunity because if they achieve to get education they will get a better job,too.

Next, life is very weird sometimes because the people who is attending the school they does not want to go to the school and all of those who doesn't have the opportunity they want to attend the school. I had have the opportunity to meet guys than they have everything what they want but they do not like the school because they prefer to go to another place to smoke,drink alcohool or something like that. they are getting bad habit. Furthermore, they are leaving the time to pass and wasting it and then, for those guys is reallybad idea because they have all the time to learn faster than others.

Finally, the eduacation is very important for everybody because with education you can get a better job and also to get a better future. In my case, I really struggling with school because I work and attend the school so, I know that it is very hard to do both things at the same time but at the end I know that I will be a successful man and that's why I never give up I just have my head up and I trusth in God that he is giving me strenght to keep working hard and I will get my diploma. After that first God I will keep working for my future.

In conclusion, all the opportunity that come from us is fine because the opportunities just come one time. This opportunity that some schools are given to the students is really good because when they get sick and they can not go to the school they can do it from their house and do not loss classes and be able to be really with the classes. As before I say the education is very important to achive goals in life. For those guys who does not have the opportunity to attend school

I just could say that they need to strunggle very hard. In life nothing is impossible if god close doors is because he is going to open another one much better. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A08514994C66,"Many students are tired of having to wake up early every morning to attend school. Due to this, some schools offer a distance learning program that people believe will benefit the student by allowing them to work from home. Distance learning is not beneficial because the student will lose valuable life traits, and the student will suffer.

While many people believe that distance learning will still allow students to gain important life skills; in fact, the students lose valuable traits needed in society due to not going to school. The students lose social skills by being at home all the time. The inability to communicate effectively with other humans is lost by not attending school. The students who do not come to school will have a hard time obtaining a job that involves speaking to another person because they did not learn how to when they should have. Additionally, the student also loses the ability to be independent when they are learning from home. Educational institutes teach students how to be independent in the future, and students who do not physically attend school will, after they graduate, constantly beg for everything to be handed to them. Students who never learned how to be properly independent will also never want to work for anything, thus furthering their need to rely on others. Furthermore, students who learn from home will undoubtedly lose the ability to make lasting friendships. Not being able to meet and interact with people at a young age significantly lowers an individual's circle of friends. Not having friends also makes a person feel lonely, having nobody to talk to or laugh with. Distance learning greatly reduces the skills an individual will possess, not allowing him to become a fully functioning member of society.

People say that distance learning will make the student want to do work; however, the student will only suffer due to not attending school. The student's grades will suffer by not arriving at campus every day. Being comfortable will make the student do less work, therefore lowering his grade. Students will likely sleep through courses rather than complete them because they are at home instead of school, which will lower their grades. Moreover, students will also suffer mentally while not attending school. Being the only person who attends school online will result in the student getting cyberbullied by his classmates outside of school, therefore taking a toll on his mental health. Not being able to ask for help effectively if one needs it can stress a student out, hurting their brain. Also, the student physically suffers by not attending school. By not physically walking from class to class each day, the student's legs will grow weak and may eventually give out if not worked on. Students participating in distance learning courses are incapable of taking physical education, which is a very important course, strengthening an individual's body and mind. Indeed, distance learning makes the student suffer in more ways than one.

While distance learning may be needed for certain people, such as ones with illness or disabilities; nevertheless, for the majority of students, it is not very beneficial. Students who attend distance learning courses suffer more than students who physically attend school. They suffer both mentally and physically, and their grades spiral downhill. Distance learning courses also prevent students from obtaining life skills needed in their future. Skills such as communication and independence are lost when the student does not arrive to their educational building each and every day. If distance learning becomes more popular, students all over the world will live in a future where they cannot function properly, and the generations to come will not have much of a society to live in.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
A9B89BB57964,"While for many years the traditional way of a class comprised of students physically being in the class to learn, now in the age of the internet students can participate in the classroom at home. People believe that students should still go to school but students gain many benefits when they attend school at home because they have more personal time, have better attendance, and make schools less crowded.

Students have been balancing school and after curricular activities for a long time now, but students would have more available time if they took online classes. Students can choose classes based on their own personal schedule. This would make it easier to balance their day because they can do there classes before or after their activities. Also the classes would be flexible unlike normal school where there is a fixed time one must be at school to learn, now it can change based on a student's daily tasks. If a student is late or sick one day instead of missing precious class time and material they now can catch up on later in the day with out any backlash. Online classes would help give students more free time because the class depends on how fast a kid can learn and complete the material. If a student is really gifted they can learn and finish new material very quickly, which gives them more time to focus on their own lives and not about school. Traditionally in the classroom the teachers job is to make sure that all the students learn, therefore many times a handful of students would be ready to move on and learn but the teacher cannot because there are other students who are behind. Online classes solve this by making it possible for a student to move on individually at what ever pace they need it to be. The introduction of online classes can gift a student with more time and freedom.

When a student misses school they lose a lot of valuable learning but with online classes they will achieve a better attendance record. Online school makes it possible so the classroom is where ever a student has a smart device with an internet connection. That means that whether a student is on vacation or is in a blizzard they can learn. The student will never have to miss another class because they are sick because they can even learn in their bed, this will severely cut down the attendance gap that many students have. Online schooling will decrease the rates that students skip. When a students skips school they would usually be able to make up the work the next day but with online classes they would stay at home and would have to complete their work or their grades would suffer, so this cuts down the days a student would be able to skip and not do any work. Online schooling helps coax kids into not skipping and pushes learning on the go, this drastically helps with missed time in the class room

Many schools around the country are over crowded but with online schooling taking kids out of the school majorly helps with overcrowding. When online schooling takes away kids from a school that is overcrowded it takes off the stress put on the education system there. This makes class rooms smaller and teachers more available to a smaller class but for more time. This also helps the students by making there school day more efficient. When a school gets smaller they can spread their resources more efficiently. Now not only do students at home who take online classes get benefits but also kids in schools. The school now has more money, time and availability to each individual student, which enriches their own learning. Online classes helps take away students from schools and helps with overcrowding and in the process improve the learning of others.

With the introduction of online learning, students in school or at home both receive great benefits that improve their educational experience. This happens through the process of giving students more time, keeping them in school, and relieving other schools of overcrowding. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D1748C4CD7B4,"As the modern world advances in technology and media, schools need to advance with it. An outdated education system leaves little room for student growth and success; it can damper the effects of the hard work that both teachers and students put into school. However, this waste of efforts can be easily avoided by means of the updating of school policies. For example, it is growing increasingly more common for schools to offer distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to engage in online classes and video conferencing as a way of learning from home. Therefore, students would be able to attend classes virtually from their own homes. Distance learning is an absolutely essential program that all schools should offer, as it allows long-term home bound students to attend classes, short-term absent students to make up their school work faster, and increases the student-technology relationship, which strengthens learning as a whole.

Distance learning would allow long-term home bound students to learn alongside their peers, even if they are unable to physically attend school. Every year, thousands of students are forced to stay home for extended periods of time due to physical or mental illness or other individual reasons. These students, while they are oftentimes provided worksheets and assignments, are quite prone to falling behind in terms of the material. If they are not at school and at the lessons each and every day, it is extremely easy to lose awareness of the material being taught, especially if the only outlet for their learning is a packet of worksheets with practice problems. Without a teacher and peers, these students do not have access to immediate feedback on mistakes or teachers who are able to answer their questions. However, with distance learning, long-term home bound students would be able to work alongside their peers. They could engage in online activities and applications that would strengthen their knowledge of the material, while also allowing them to interact with their teacher and peers. Especially when it comes to video conferencing, students who cannot physically attend school would still be able to ask their teacher questions in person and potentially have private lessons. It is never a student's fault if they are unable to come to school due to an illness; therefore, it should not be difficult to learn if that is the case.

Not only would distance learning aid long-term home bound students, but it would also help the short-term ones. Students stay home from school every day, whether it be from a minor illness or injury or a trip out of town. Obviously, these students are at much less risk of losing their understanding of the material, but absences still require make-up work. Students can miss lessons and lectures, project presentations, and critical study time with their peers that would better their understanding. With distance learning, a student who is well enough to work but contagious to their peers could still present a project, take a test, take notes on a lecture, and engage in class discussions all from home. It is unfair to limit a student's potential learning time based on things that they cannot control, like illnesses or travel. Furthermore, students that travel frequently would also be benefited, as they could work while on the go and review material when they have free time so as not to fall so far behind their classmates.

Some might argue that the use of technology and distance learning would not be an effective way to educate students. There are possibilities for misuse of technology and applications and many people fear that an introduction of too much technology into education would lessen the quality of that education exponentially. However, there are steps that can be taken to limit off-task student activity: students could be limited to certain applications or browser extensions or be monitored by a parent or guardian. All things considered, though, the potential for the waste of students' time in no way warrants a dismissal of distance learning. Especially when considering all of the students that would otherwise not be able to learn, the meager amount of work to set up technology restrictions for those schools who desire it is most definitely worth it in the long run. Furthermore, simply because some students may abuse the power of distance learning does not mean that it should not be offered to those who truly need it.

Distance learning should be made available to all applicable students because it allows for long-term home bound students to attend classes, short-term absent students to make up their school work faster, and increases the student-technology relationship. Distance learning programs would not only help the students in keeping up with their studies, but also teachers in supplying their students with adequate learning resources for all situations. It has become even more prevalent now; as the COVID-19 virus spreads internationally, more and more schools and universities are transitioning to virtual learning for the safety of students, teachers, and staff. Truly, distance learning ensures the safety of those involved without sacrificing any of the benefits of a physical classroom. So long as advancements like distance learning continue to be made in the future, education will maintain its vital and prevalent role in all students' lives.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
A69FAFC409EC,"Did you know that many schools offer a other way of learning that doesn't require you to go to school? Many schools across the world offer online schooling ,but the question is do you think student benefit from being able to attend school that home? I would agree that it is very beneficial that student have the option to do school at their home because they are still learning, it may not be their choice,and some student might feel that it is better if they do their school work that home.

Firstly, I would argue that it simply might not be their choice at all,many students might have to pick up one or maybe even two jobs just to help their parents pay the bills and help put food on the table. So them having another way of learning that does require them to go to school will help them out a lot. Some kids parents are in the military so that getting up and moving school to school could be very hard for them to adjust to so online classes would be benefiting not only the kids so that they dont have to keep on having to losing bond with new friend every time their parents get station in a new state or city but it would also help the parent not have to worry about their kids in school. Not all kids in this world have the option to go to school they may have to pick multiple jobs or never just stay in one school like the rest of us so them still getting to learn like the rest of us is very important.

Secondly,Many student deal with bullies or people harassing them on a day to day because they might be different or dress a type of way at school so they student who have to deal with these problems might feel that they don't want to go to school anymore so online class or video conferencing with their teacher so that they can get the work and notes will benefit them and the won't have to deal with those type of issues while not having to having to with those long lasting affect for being bullied. Some student might just feel like they can work better and learn more while being at home and taking online classes, if students are still learning and get the information that they are supposed to be getting then that should be what is really important. If they are can get all the work and still learn and get all the information that the kids that are in school are getting the it is beneficial. They are still learning but doing it a different way.

To conclude, anyway of obtaining knowledge should be beneficial no matter if you are at home or at school as long as you are learning then their should be nothing wrong with that. Now looking that it from another side of the argument i can see why you could say that the experience and that the bonds you will make at school you can get anywhere else. While that is true that is not why school was built, it was built for you to learn and all that stuff are just peaks of going to school but your main focus should be on learning and if you have to be at home to learn and get you be chance to succeed then that should be what is beneficial. Now i ask you to look and she if your local schools what online classes and if they don't write a letter to their school board or principle and push them to try and make so you never know you can really be helping someone out ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3D9C932F2EB1,"Many school systems now offer distance learning, an option for students to learn at home through online methods.

Students are able to video conference with teachers, watch prerecorded lectures, and receive and submit assignments on sites like Google Classroom and Blackboard. The question that should be asked is if students actually benefit from online classes. Some students with long term illnesses and specific learning styles would learn better, but overall most students should choose to avoid online school because of fewer social interactions with peers, more learning distractions at home, and additional costs for students' families and schools.

Students will have less social interaction which may put them behind when it comes to going to college and entering the workforce. If students who chose to attend an online school throughout high school decide to go to a traditional college they may be at a disadvantage. Depending on what they major in, it could be very similar to their experience with online school. Other students would be faced with new challenges like labs and group projects. If a students has never done group work before they may struggle with communication and teamwork aspect that it takes to complete difficult group projects. It is possible that these students may struggle during their first year or two at college purely because they have trouble interacting with their peers. Online students may also struggle when entering the workforce. They may lack certain social skills necessary to shine during interviews. It is wise to send student to traditional school so they can absorb some of the culture that is needed to get far in life.

Students need to be able to get close to their peers through shared experiences at traditional schools in order to really excel in life.

Students learn better in school environments because they are faced with less distractions. Students who switch to online school may see a drop in grades because they are faced with new distractions like family members, pets, and poor learning spaces. If a student stays at home all day they may have to interact with stay-at-home parents and family pets who could be very distracting. Students who feel that they can not tell a pesky parent to stop bothering them will end up juggling their schoolwork, family life, and walking the dog. In traditional schools, students learn in classrooms everyday. When students attend online school they could do their work anywhere. Locations such as bedrooms, living rooms and next to the television are not good environments for learning. Students should find a spot which is only used for their schoolwork. Students at traditional schools will be free from these distractions and poor learning environments which may improve their grades.

Online schools could end up costing families and schools systems more. If families have to make sure their student has a working laptop computer everyday then they will spend more money on care and maintenance. Some families might not be able to spend extra money on a new device. Kids could be stuck with old devices that malfunction and do not have updated software. Old computers may not be able to keep up with all the programs students are expected to use. School systems will also have to hire staff so they can operate online schools. New teachers and technological aides would cause taxes to be increased. Families may not be able to keep up with this change. Online schools may seem like a budget friendly option because of lower transportation costs, but for some families it might be catastrophic.

Online school could benefit some groups of students like those with long term illnesses and some certain types of learning styles. Students that can not come to a traditional school because of illness but still have enough time and energy to continue learning should look into online schools. That way student who may have to miss months at a time can still keep up with their classmates. Another good use of online school would be for students with different learning styles. Some kids can not sit through long block scheduled classes and would thrive if they could split up the work in a different way. These students could have more freedom with the way they wanted to work and might be more interested in learning. Online school could contribute to certain groups of students continuing to grow intellectually and good learning habits, but overall would not work for the majority of students.

Online school currently has many problems, but if those problems can be fixed, online schools would be a great resource depending on what the future holds. Online schools may be more popular in the future, but for the present traditional schools are more effective for the growth of students. In conclusion online schools are better for some students, but right now most students should stay at a traditional school because of more social interactions, fewer distractions, and fewer costs for schools and families. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
78FFA7DA37CA,"Schools and learning are constantly evolving to improve education and cater to the needs of all students. Some of these changes include specialized programs, new learning environments, and new methods of learning. The skills needed for the modern job market are changing as well and often involve use of new technology. One of the new methods of learning which coincides with the use of technology is online classes. Online classes can offer students to learn when they cannot attend school, offer a diverse learning platform, and a variety of classes. These, along with many other factors, are why online classes offered to students at home are beneficial.

When students cannot attend school, they often stress about the learning time they will be missing and the workload they will be left with to makeup. For example, if a student is sick for a week, especially in middle or high school, they miss crucial learning time and face making up missed class, which is a burden. When students are sick they should not be worried about what they will have to do to makeup work, and can instead do their work from home to stay caught up. With online classes available to students, they can stay on top of their assignments even when they are not physically at school. When students go on vacations they face a similar issue; makeup work. If online classes were available to students, they could learn from wherever they are with only a laptop. The online classes could also serve as means of communication between the instructor and student when a student is absent. The ability for students to keep up with their schoolwork and communicate with their teacher exemplify why online classes are beneficial to students and their education.

Many jobs now require an extensive knowledge of technology, among other skills, and many people have a lot to learn regarding the world of technology. Online classes, along with in-school learning, can offer a diverse learning platform to students. When taking an online class, students would benefit from having to learn how to use new technology and familiarize themselves with new programs. Due to the new widespread use of technology and online classes for higher education, students would be able to prepare themselves for their futures at a young age. Many colleges offer online classes for busier individuals, and many companies use video conferencing to communicate with colleagues or students all over the world. Diverse learning can help students develop new skills in these fields as well as offering an alternative to the traditional classroom experience. Typically, a class consists of teacher instruction and lectures. Not all students learn the same way and can best expand their knowledge and express their talents in different ways. Students who do not always learn well in a classroom may be able to flourish in an online class with video instruction. The mix of learning opportunities can also help keep students engaged in their education by not having the same learning experience every day of school. If students completed classes through a mix of online classes and on campus classes, they might be more attentive to each since they wouldn't be doing the same activities every day. A diverse learning platform through online classes is beneficial because they can help educate students about technology, teach them new skills, offer an alternative to classroom learning, and keep them engaged in their studies.

Most schools have students taking up to eight classes each school year, but many students would like to challenge themselves with more classes or would like to take classes the school may not offer. All students have different interests and learning capabilities that can't always be offered by schools but can be given by online classes. For instance, if a student wanted to take a foreign language, such as Swahili, most schools do not offer this course but it could easily be taught to the student through an online class. Students who are considered to be gifted may want to take higher level classes that the school doesn't have and could take the class with a online program at home so they can fulfill their interests and challenge themselves to do a difficult task. Not only can online classes provide courses that the school doesn't have, but can also provide the classes schools do have but in a different platform. If a student already has their eight classes for the year filled, they could take additional classes at home with online classes. Students who want to graduate high school early, or are simply eager to learn something different, can greatly benefit from online classes at home.

The benefits of online classes to students are numerous, but are most beneficial in that they can teach students who are absent, offer a variety of ways to learn to students, and can give students class opportunities they may not have from traditional schooling. Education has to change with the world around it and one of the best ways to adapt to the changes is reflecting what is being changed. Technology is now a part of every day life, and much of life revolves around it. Online classes and video conferencing are part of this new technology and students should have the potential to become experts of modern technology. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5D74C7B81D0F,"School is a place for students to learn and get the education they need to be successful in the future. Students attend school 5 days a week for about 8 to 9 months each year. There are many ways you can attend school. There is public school, private school, and online school that you can attend at home. I think the most beneficial way to attend school is public school. I think public school is the most beneficial way because, the students that is attending can physically get out of the house and socialize with his or her peers. Also in the United States public school is completely free! I think the least beneficial way to attend school is online school. I do not think it is beneficial for students to attend school online from home because, there are too many distractions at home, the cost of online schools compared to other schools, and it makes it easier for students to cheat.

One reason why i do not think online school is not beneficial is because of the distractions that can be found at home. When a student is physically attending school they tend to be more motivated then students who attend school online at home. This is because the student that is attending the school is aware that it is a school environment and that everyone is there to get the education they need. However, when a student attends online school they are more likely to get distracted. This is because students that attend online school are in a home setting that contains many distractions such as, easy access to electronics, food, and any other forms of entertainment. Online school will also motivate students to get up and do other things instead of doing the work they were assigned and supposed to do. This will cause the student to turn in the assignment late or even not turning the assignment in at all (which can eventually lead to bad grades).

Another reason why I think online school is not beneficial is because of the price. Online school is way more expensive then any other schools. Parents of students that attend online school have to pay thousands and thousand of dollars every month in order for their child to continue on attending school online. Public school on the other hand is completely free and anyone can attend it. In my opinion, if online school had a higher education rate I would understand why it is so expensive, but the thing that is really interesting to me is that online school is receiving similar education with the people that don't attend school online.

Finally the last reason why I think attending online school is not beneficial is because it makes it easier for students to cheat. I think it is easier for a student to cheat while attending online school is because there is no one watching them when they're working on an important assignment like a test or quiz. When no one is watching them the student might get the urge to cheat. A few examples of cheating maybe, searching up the answer to a question online or even ask someone else to do the assignment for them. The reason why students attending online school would cheat is because they know that it is harder for them to get caught. In public school there is always a teacher in the room while the students are taking a quiz or a test. Because there is a teacher in the room the chances of a student cheating on an assignment decreases.

This is because when a teacher is present in the room the student is possibly afraid of getting caught. If a student is ever caught cheating there will always be a consequence.

School is a very important aspect of someones future and life. So in conclusion, I think taking online school at home is not beneficial because, the distractions found at home, the cost of online schools compared to other schools, and it makes it easier for students to cheat. Yes online school still might be a school where people attend to learn, but I personally think the type of school a student is attending matters because it effects their ability to learn and comprehend things. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
05118F820085,"In may opinion, i think students they can't benefit by attending classes at home.

Because it is going to be so mach difficult for they working at home stading or doing homework by them self and by taking a classes online or video conferencing is going to be mach difficult then taking a class with a real teacher and not on the computer.

Is a lot of distraction at home like children's, noises, and animals so that is going to make a distraction for them so at home it is not going to be a good place for them to study, and student they can't concentrate when they are working so study at home is not going to be a place for student's, and some of the students they don't care about studding thats why they prefer to study at home were no one is going to tel them noting if he don't do homework or study for a test.

Students they can get boring, tired, or angry when they don't no how to do sameting and they don't get help from nobody to do homework or something that they don't no how to do and then they star getting deprecation or headech.

The best way the students can be benefit, is going to school, get help from teachers, learn more then study at home, they can do something different like do sports, playing music, or something that is going to make their future grad.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
DA025E83C104,"The benefit by taking classes online. The benefit are the students don't has to go school, the classes are more shorest and one disadvantage is the student has to work by it self. The online classes have many benefit but it do have some disadvantage.

First, The student don't have to go school. The stdudent rather more online classes then go to to schools. The student. The student who are all the time late to school they will not be late any more. The students can wake up late to take their classes. This is one of many benefits for taking online classes.

Second, The online classes are more shorest then the time the students have to be in the schools. Most of the students . prefer online classes because the wake up and take the class any where the student is. The classes at school are more longer then classes in online. This is why the student prefer online classes beause those classes are more chorest.

Third, The disadvantage by taking online classes . The student have to work alone by it self. The students have alot of work and nobody can help him. The student can't work with other students after classes. The teacher during te time the classes he can help the student when that tie finis the teacher finish helping the student. The studentsthey don't have time to meet other students. This are some disanvantage by gething online classes for thr students.

Finally, The student in favor of goin to school the want to get more online classes. These are some benefit why most of the student want to take online clases. There are some good benefit for taking online classes.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
4F7E14B7D72F,"Some schools offer a at home program to help kids who are absent at school, it is a way to keep there grades from dropping so low that its hard for them to make them back up. One absence can lead to a much larger problem such as, missing a day of learning something new. If a child misses a day or starting something brand new they may be quite confused for the rest of the year every time they are obligated to work on something they never got to learn correctly. If they were to miss a day of a test, they would have to make that up the next class period. At that point every day in the future they will always be behind to work on last classes work they didnt get around to. Is the school system of learning from home a good, or bad idea?

The reason why this is a good way to help kids, is sometimes, they cant help but not attend in which case they should be eligible to make up the work that they missed from home on there own time. Sometimes family problems can occur such as; parents cant take them, there mother needs help, family funeral, wedding, and hospital trips. These are all things that the child can not necessarily control and has no power to prevent them. This is why that same child should not have to fall behind their piers because, a family event comes into play, that they cannot control.

When a child misses one singular day from school, it could easily cause a snowball effect. The student misses the first day of learning how to solve linear equations when he or she returns the next day or even later, the other students in the class have already completed it. The teacher will not re-teach the entire category just to please said student. At this point the child will ask as many questions as possible to try to piece the strategy of learning back together, sometimes it works, sometimes it dose not. The child will now spend the class trying to learn how to do linear equations, by the end of the day they will now be two class periods behind there fellow students. The day they come back after that they will be trying to get the work they missed done and end up missing that classes assignments, you can see how this snowball affect can start to come about. But with this new online learning the student can pitch in with there fellow students while they learn, he or she will also learn although they may not be at school. When the child returns he or she is up to date with all the work and will not fall into the trap of missing work

People may argue that this will allow the child to stay home for no serious reason because they can just learn it from home. This is not true, although it is online and they learn and keep mostly up to date the student would not receive the handouts and worksheets the teacher has given out. The students would receive zeros for this incomplete work. it is designed to give the students a fighting chance against the zeros they would receive but also cannot be abused. If a child abuses the system by attempting to stay home more they will still receive zeros for there missing work. Knowing this, it is no different for them to not come to school without the program it can only serve positive use it will not drag the child down by any means.

The online absent schooling program would greatly benefit the students who attend the school. The positives outweigh the negatives by a landslide. The child would be more engaged in class, not fall behind the other students, have motivation to attend, increase they grades and learning capabilities. Compared to missing a day of school and bring your grade and your motivation to do good down this online option would help the students out tremendously and encourage them to do better and stay better.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Most colleges in the country offer distance learning for students to be able yo attend class from home by way of online or video confrencing to archieve their grades or credits to graduate and be suuccesful. I believe students will benefit alot with distance learning. Most schools like Virginia Common Wealth University(VCU), Old Dominion University(ODU), George Mason University(GMU) are first class school who provide long distance education to the country and the state. There are many reasons i would encourage parents and students to involve themselves into being interested in distance learning.

Distance learning does not only teach student's just the study of Science, Mathematics, or English. It also helps students benefit in moral teaching, moral skills, and a way of living on your own to archieve your goals. It also helps students solve their own problems own their own without the help of their parents. With distance learning you can apply to have your job to be able to carter for yourself. Distance learning makes you prepared for type of job career you have interest in. Most jobs careers require alot of hardwork and alot of time to study for you to archieve the credits and grades you need to graduate. Studying Medicine, Engineering,and Architecturing requires alot of time, students attend school over the normal four years program to archieve everything in life. This requires alot of determination to be able to archieve your goals and to be succesful. Virginia has some of the best schools in the country thaat offers a long distance learning.

Many reports have been made around the world about long distance learning education that has affected the idea of allowing parents enroll their wards into a long distance learning institutions, such as schoool shooting, food poisoning. We know parents care about the safety of their wards well being but long distance institutions are protected by the state police department that prevent any kind of harm that will be caused by any students on campus. Schools that offer long distance education protects the rights and life of the students, students are being inspected frequently by the police department regularly to check the safety of the student to make sure everything is okay. Students are protected and are able to attend class all the time, even due to serious weather conditons students are prevented and protected by the school to stay indoors during a bad weather. Parents should be educated on the safety the school gives their wards and how long distance education benefits every student.

Sooner or later, long distance education will be more benefited and more safer for parents to allow their wards to enroll in long distance learning to archieve their goals. Most Jobs recquire students to have alot of time to study and practice to be able to pass and graduate. I encourage every student to enroll in long distance learning to explore new things, have a good environment of study, and to adopt a certain way of life he or she has gained in long distance education.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F2AF7AB56B7A,"Students should focus on having a great education to make their future better. A lot of students attend classes from home online. While others go to school to get their education. All students should go to school for a great experience. Although, you are learning you also make new friends, get into extracurricular activities, and field trips with your classes. You will have so much fun in the process of graduating.

At school is where students first make friendships. One student could be helping another and they could end up becoming great friends. You see students roaming around with each other all the time and it's great to see no one getting left behind or all alone. For example, when I went to school there were a lot of friendly people like me. We all came together and introduced ourselves and went to class together. We started to hang out more and till this day we are still close as ever. If a student is not at school someone can update them on school work they missed so they can be caught up with everything. It's good to always have someone to talk to. Whenever a student may feel sad they can pick he/she head back up and make them feel glad again. Friends can help you go through tough times and help you get through anything. The students can go to more activities with their friends, invite them to places, and play games. They are the people you can share your secrets with and trust them that they can keep it. Students can make memories with their friends to never forget about even when they graduate. They can have fun together throughout school.

While students are in school they can also sign up for extracurricular activities. To keep students occupied they can join clubs and sports and other things at school that they can enjoy. It keeps the students on a great path and can also look good on a students record when they go to college. A lot of students sometimes want to stay at school and do more things. For instance, I was one of those kids who always stayed back for soccer or band. Most of all it kept me busy and out of trouble. Students can end up loving what they do and can focus on that to make their future life successful. There are also adults right along with them through every step of the way. They keep the students on track and help whether it's tutoring, sports, or clubs. They make students the best they can be. Extracurricular give a boost on a student record. Colleges may look that and also how good they are and give them a scholarship. Extracurricular have been a big help for students all around the world. Students love the after-school activities and it keeps them up. It can also help with academics because the students would need good grades while exploring these activities.

Students love to take field trips. It's like having a break with all the people you want to share that breaks with. As they are on the field trip students can go around and make notes about the field trip and try new things. Not only that, but some field trips are just for fun! Schools can go to amusement parks, beaches, museums, etc. Some schools also have out of the country field trips. They can have a good time with other students, teachers, and some family members! You can learn so much as you go through each field trip and also try a lot of new things that you haven't. I remember I went to a museum and I touched a sting ray, baby snake, and some other things. It was cool to learn about other animals and see what they do. Field trips are another way for learning. You can observe things, touch things, and listen. It's all a fun experience no student should want to miss. After all they're still having fun.

Some people would say that being home is better and more comfortable. Yes that's true but what else can they do than stare at a computer all day? They won't have any other things to do while their parents are still at work. School can give you a better opportunity to express and find yourself. There's a better chance at school for anything. It's better if you need help, your teacher can help you one on one and you can actually see face to face. You can make new friends everyday and take field trips all day. Also to do more helpful things for your record.

Education is very important throughout a child's life. How they learn is up to them. School has different ways of learning that students can choose from. School also has fun things to do without learning that and you can have fun. Students can make new friends, have extracurricular activities, and field trips with classes. There's so much fun things to do that you can have a awesome high school experience.

793517BB1BB3,"In the life today, education is important for people, and an options of choosing school or places to learn are also make people thinking. From what I heard on the news, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But, is it truly helpful for student? or it is just the way to comfort student, so they can stay home and do whatever you want to do without the administer from the teacher.

First, when we talking about schools, we are also talking about our future, this is really important more than anything. If we come to school everyday we will get a punch of information and ideas for our self, we could meet other people, contact with them and make friends. In that way, you will never feel stressful or stuck instead of staying home and do your own work.

Second, even though school are welcome you to come, but somehow the weather, the distance or something about personal that make you not able to come to schools, and the better options for you that are stay at home and learning from online or conferencing. For me, if I have a chance to choose between two options, I will choose to be in class, not attend classes from home, even though something will clog me, I will still want to come to schools. For example, if I spend in schools I could know a lot of things than I stay and take classes at home, I will meet my friends and my teacher everyday, we will discus about stuff at school, joining some club to reduce stressful after schools. And if you decide to take classes online, it is not bad, but for me it is not helpful. You better to go to school, you have to contact with other people, having conversation and discus with each other. You have the right to choose your own options. But be active, don't be passive.

Third, dispose your time is the best way to live. If you can walk, you able to go to schools, so the option attend classes at home is not for you to choose, it is not benefit for you, I am just agree with the people who not able to move or stuck of something about personal to take classes at home, in that way, they can get information and study like other people. So I think that is fair for everyone, don't just give student an option like that and it will turning them to be lazy, busy working or don't have enough time in schools. If necessary, student can take online after schools to complete anything they miss.

Finally, I think we should put the option about the classes online for only the people who are not able to go any where, not for normal people. In that way we can balance between these two, and every student can study in the better way.

In conclusion, benefit or not benefit are depend on you, for me the option to take classes at home is not benefit, because I always want to come to schools everyday to get experience for myself, to get new things and meet new people. And you should go that way like me, we young and we hold our future in our hand, don't just stay passive. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
56CE596E4779,"Why Online Schooling Is Failing Students

When examining human history, one can note that societies have underwent change, but is all change necessarily progress? Obviously, this question is determined by whether or not the change is beneficial. Currently, schools are tackled with answering this question. While most schools teach their students by a classroom environment, some have decided to take a novel approach. These schools have transferred the teaching environment to the internet where subjects taught to by video conferencing. This, I argue, is a change for the worst. Most glaringly, this method changes the entire classroom setting to one that seems more out of reach and less interactive. It's also important to consider that schools teach more than just subjects; rather, schools enhance student's lives by introducing them to a diversity of people, both other students and teachers. Outside of class, students can learn from their peers or perhaps befriend them to form long-lasting friendships. This simply doesnt work, at least not as effectively, with a digital simulation. Lots of these important factors are lost with online schooling. Schools should reconsider the idea of video conferencing as beneficial because the environment it create damages learning, and the loss of a social atmosphere hurts students' future.

To determine whether this change is good or not depends on the question of ""does this change enable students to learn more or less?"" Personally, I find technology very distracting, and I'm sure teachers know this very well in their classroom environment. In our school, students are found scavenging any time to play on their phone whether appropriate or in appropriate. Video conferencing will intensify this problem. If you merge class time and technology, it's no secret what will happen. The student will likely find themselves doing something else more exciting than learning such as playing on their phone or hanging out with their friends. A teacher needs to be there one-on-one to establish boundaries to deter this behavior. Without this, even if they receive a punishment for it, distraction are simply more tempting when no one is physically there. By contrast, conventional schooling teaches people how to respect authority, and is more effective in discouraging students from distraction, a necessary lesson in achieving their goal as a contributing member of society.

Learning doesnt just relate to textbooks or tests, it also encompass social learning. Interacting with others is crucial in a wealth of jobs, and what better place to teach it than schools? EQ, or emotional intelligence, is the type of intelligence that assesses how well an individual performs in a social environment. To develop this, individuals need physical interaction in order to understand body language and speech patterns of others. Recently, jobs have been considering this over IQ, so an ideal student dedicated to online learning is heavily disadvantaged in that department. This new system can narrow the job opportunities available for students, and it's outside of their control! The loss of a social environment can also stunt an individual's development. Erick Erickson, a social psychologist, argues that teenage development is characterized by integrating roles to establish an identity, and that the lack of which can have a catastrophic ripple effect later on in life. Public schools prevent this by offering a diversity of people which students can converse with. This is often overlooked as a privilege offered by traditional schooling, but it's especially important during middle and high school where individuals are confused about who they are. Teenagers receive a sense of reassurance when they feel socially accepted, and who knows the inadvertent psychological consequences of the lack of this later on in life.

When one considers the damaging effects on learning and the problems that stem from a weak social environment, it's clear that the idea of video conferencing has a negative impact on students. This issue extends past the scope of schools. It reflects our intent with technology as a society moving forward, so it's an important one to establish a consensus on. Recently, technology has shortened our attention span and caused us to become more lazy, but simultaneously, it has interconnected us and sent us to the moon. It has both positive and negative effects depending on how we use it, but do we want it to enhance our life or control it?             ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6867D67B3444,"Why online classes are not good for you!

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to experience school from home? So many things have happened over the years in schools that have caused changes from receiving healthier food at school, to getting better technology. But the one thing that has definitely impacted school today is online classes. Online classes are something that if you asked people to view their thoughts on the subject, their opinions would be split. Online Classes would be bad for students because it provides the student with more distractions, they do not receive much hands-on experience or practice, and it prevents them from getting the true school experience.

The first reason why students should not take online classes, is that it causes room for distractions. In the modern world today, there are many things that could distract students such as electronics, pets, noises, etc. Imagine trying to work on a paper and all of a sudden the cat jumps up on the table and knocks over the diet cola that was sitting in a cup on the table; you would not only have to get up and clean the mess, but you would also have to move the cat elsewhere taking up precious time that could be spent working on an assignment. With online classes, everything is done at home. A student could be taking a test online and could hear just the tiniest noise and very easily get distracted. It is evident with the reasons I provided, why online classes provide such a high risk for distractions at home.

The second reason why students should not take online classes, is they are not receiving hands-on experience and practice. If a student was answering a question where a picture was shown about dissecting on a test for her anatomy class and it was asking where one of the incisions should be cut she would not have been able to answer it due to the fact that the closest she had gotten to seeing a dissection, was by watching the video provided by her teacher. In classes such as math, it would be hard to teach the kids online when a subject such as that involves a lot of hands-on practice to fully understand the concepts. Because they are taking it online, there is no way for them to really get in contact with the teacher considering they may live many states away or even countries! How can you learn from your mistakes if you do not know what you are doing wrong and what you can do to fix it if you are unable to talk to the teacher about it in person. So it is logical, that online classes do not give students the ability to achieve to higher standards because they are not able to learn as well if they are not learning from their teacher in person.

The final reason that students should not take online classes, is that it prevents the ability to receive the true school experience. If a student decides they want to participate in something like the school's 4th annual tricycle race, then they will, but if they decide instead of participating they want to watch then they can do that too. Some people may say that school is all about making memories and trying new things, but that is not always the case, your memories are what you choose to make them. But with online classes, they prevent the ability for students to try new things, or socialize with friends. Socializing with friends plays a big factor in why online classes should not be allowed, because what if the only way of communicating with your friend was by going to school during a certain block; you would not be able to because you would be too busy at home taking your online classes to do so. Some people do not like to talk to others online because in their mind it is just harder to so, and it not only decreases your social skills but it also decreases your grammar skills too if you are always texting someone online instead of having a conversation with them in person. So with the information I provided, online classes take away the ability to experience or try something new at the student's school.

Online classes according to some people are good because they provide the chance for the student to go out into the real world and get a job, they provide the student less stress, and it provides the chance for the student to be more comfortable with their surroundings. Jobs provide students the opportunity to gain real life experience. Working at home provides less things to stress over and makes the student more comfortable with their surroundings and less likely to get sick because they are not being surrounded by all those germs. But because students are provided with more distractions, do not receive much hands-on experience or practice, and are prevented from getting the true school experience that they deserve, they should not take online classes from home and instead proceed with taking regular classes at their local school.

So in conclusion, students will never succeed if online classes are always holding them back. This is why I urge you now to get up, take a stand, and fight for what's right!",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
20A4E74DE0C3,"Students have the option to attend classes from home that some schools offer them. It's important for students to get a good education whether they get it from attending to school or online. Schools must focus on some ways students can be benefited from learning. Schools should not offer students options to attend classes from home because students will not take their education seriously, they will be distracted from many things, and they will not learn efficiently.

Many students don't take their lives seriously, especially their education. This school option will make students not to complete their tasks on time. Because they will not have an adult telling them that they need to complete, they will take their education less serious. They will not see education as an important thing. It's likely that they would be slacking around at home, because teachers will not be there to tell them what to do.

There are many things students can be distracted from. Any device, for example, can be a distraction for students. A phone can be a problem for them. It's a distraction that can stop them from learning. There are high chances students would be texting with someone and using social media when taking classes online. They would also be going out too much, leading them to forget that they have classes to take online. At home, they would feel tired and bored because they won't even have any social interaction. They would go out more often and would it would lead them to be distracted every time they go out.

Education is important, but taking classes online will not make students to learn efficiently. They need teachers to guide and tell them what to do. If they don't have a teacher to tell them what to do or how to do it, they will end up confused, not knowing what to do next. They will not be learning anything because they will not understand what they're doing. Their knowledge will decrease due to the lack of learning.

Although some people may say that attending classes at home is good, they are not correct. Taking classes online does not benefit students from learning. In fact, it makes them less productive. They will not have idea of what is going on. Attending classes online is not the best way for students to learn.     ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
D6E7A5034205,"The idea of working at home for most children would be very much exuberating. No need to rush to catch a bus, miss a morning breakfast to attend school, or miss school because one slept late. You'd simply wake up slap some pajamas on and get to working on your computer.

Although you would be sacrificing the basic one to one classic learning situation where teacher and student are face to face, it is still attainable to teach away from home. In the eyes of a student currently attending Generic_School, like myself, working alone can sometimes be a struggle, two minds will always be greater than one. Two minds sometimes create bias, and at times bias is good. One would benefit from hearing the other side of the argument which may ultimately end one's single-sided thinking. Also having the classroom aspect where you have multiple people who look at the same thing in different ways is important as well. Maybe the way student A looks at something is more compliant to your way of thinking rather than student B. Classmates help each other if the teacher can not, there are many instances in my learning here at Generic_School where I come to the terms of understanding a subject, but once one of my classmates broke it down for me in their way of thinking and seeing, a new light shown over the way I looked at things.

Schools may very well be a great thing, but they can also be damaging. We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth. People won't always get along it's apart of the human nature, and as you're growing up you are still trying to figure out what you do or don't get along with.

Even though there are negative things about attending school there are very much positive ones as well. One's social skills might develop more and more as time progresses and they're surrounded by situations where they are prompted to socialize with other students. Also, a student might find his or her niche, where they belong, who they really are, what they do or don't like. I can't seem to put my finger on it, but there is a difference in learning where you sit behind a screen and listen to mind numbing concepts all day, rather than sitting in a engaging classroom where you ask questions, work out problems, and get a more hands on experience.

So when you ask me, what my stance on working at home rather than at school. I would simply answer with, I don't know. The beauty of the human nature is to be able to adapt, adapt through hardships, adapt to new changes.

In my opinions take classes athome can be a good idea,fo the future students.

the students that are take classes at home can get time for be preparate ,for example the can work wherever they are ,and in anytime .they can spend their free time in classes and can be in the comfortable at their homes.

when the students get time for do their jobs at home ,I think that the can concentrate more in their jobs,and the students can learn more about their schools classes. for example .the online classes are a easy way to learning at home.

Online classes are a good methods for the furure students ,also the teachers can benefit about because they can spend time out of schools,and when the studens work in online calsses learn how work with technology,becasuse they used apps, and differents pages in the internrt.

Others methods of distances calsses are the same impotants. other impotan about take classes online is that if the weather is in bad condicones we no have lose classes because we are at home. for example , the schools suspent the classes when is rainy and if you are at home you can keep working.

The distances methods are a good way to learn ,also is a goog advancen where teh students get benefit to learning and inprobe their studys spend time in online classes is the better and easy way to preparate students for the future.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
85B5621E1876,"Many people believe distance learning is not a good idea because attending classes at home would allow the student to become distracted. These distractions could lead to procrastination, which would have a negative impact on the student's classwork, work ethic, and time management. However, I believe distance learning would be incredibly beneficial for students because they would be able to complete multiple things at once and get tasks done at a quicker pace. Also, students would not only be in a safer environment to work in, but also a more comfortable environment to work in.

Distance learning gives students a great opportunity to do multiple tasks at once and work on other things while completing the task at hand. If a student has a child or a pet to take care of, they would not have to worry about them like normal kids do at school. They can take care of them and watch them in their own house. So if anything goes wrong, the student is right there to fix it for their child or pet and then get right back to their work.

While attending classes from home, students are in a much safer environment than at a regular school. Students would be less likely to see an active school shooter if students were at home. Many students fear going to school because of occurrences like shootings or even fights, so attending classes online can help with those fears. Also, being at home can prevent or decrease the chances of getting sick. With all the other classmates and staff members at school, students are more likely to catch a spreadable disease from them like influenza, chicken pox, or even the corona virus. This could impact their learning because then the students would have to focus on becoming healthy again rather than their schoolwork, which could take a large amount of time.

Finally, distance learning gives students a chance to be in a much more comfortable work area. People know their way around their house better than at school or in a classroom because those people have, more often than not, been in their homes longer than in their particular school. Also, learning from home allows students to have easier access to things that they might not be allowed to have in a classroom. Students would have easier access to snacks, in case they get hungry; beverages, in case they get thirsty; and blankets, in case they get chilly.

All in all, attending school via the internet is beneficial for several reasons. Learning from home gives students opportunities to become more comfortable while working; opportunities that many schools prohibit. These opportunities include, eating, drinking, and even listening to music. Not only can they do these comfortable things while working, but they could also take care of other necessities while learning like their children or even their pets. Distance learning also is safer for students because they are less likely to fear school shootings and they can prevent spreading or receiving any harmful diseases or viruses. Even though distance learning could give students lots of distractions and won't improve their social lives, it gives students a chance to be safe, comfortable, and happy!",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
87B830921FBA,"Is it necessary for learning to be done in a school setting? or is there alternatives offered by technology that could help benefit the school system? This is an option that many have considered, including myself. I believe schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, because kids wouldn't have to go to school at such an early time, they'd be able to go at their own pace, and viruses could be prevented from spreading to the student population.

Over the course of time, many students have had concerns regarding the times that school starts. They have stated that they aren't able to pay attention so early in the morning. If distance learning was established, kids wouldn't have to start their days at six in the morning and spend six hours at school. Sleep plays a significant role in leaning and absorbing information, if kids are sleepy during instructional time then there's no point in teaching them anything. In various studies it's been recorded that kids aren't sleeping enough, and when they are asked why, many of them will say that it's because of the amount of time they spend on schoolwork. Waking up as early as six doesn't allow them to sleep the hours a normal kid should be sleeping. To further explain, the stress levels that children are facing due to the times they are sent to school are alarming. In many cases, the stress levels can cause depression, anxiety, and sometimes even death. Distance learning is an alternative that would greatly decrease all levels of stress and worries that children face on a day to day basis. These students would feel much more motivated and excited to learn at later times, in addition to that, their energy would be completely restored and their brains would be more alert. It seems extremely unrealistic for children to start their days so early and be expected to give their full attention and effort. Not all students learn or pay attention the same way either, some learn faster than others.

Distance learning would offer a chance for all students to learn at their own pace. There is all sorts of kids that attend school, but that doesn't mean they all absorb information at the same time or the same way as others. Video conferencing wouldn't be the only source to display information; educational sites can help the learning process as well. With the technology that is available at everyone's fingertips, learning can be made fun and more creative. Sites like Google Classroom, Google docs, EdPuzzle, Quizlet, and many more, are already used by teachers all around the country. All of that technology can be put into greater use to establish an online learning system, and teach kids. Teachers would have so many options to teach, such as: making presentations, simulations, YouTube videos, Google quizzes, and online readings. All of which would be posted on Google Classroom for the students to calmly do in the privacy of their homes, and at the pace they feel most comfortable at. Kids wouldn't have to catch up with what the teacher is saying, instead they would be able to pause the video or presentation and evaluate the information as many times until they reach full understanding of the content being presented. No information would be ignored or forgotten if distance learning is established, because it would all be stored in the computer. If a child has any sort of concern they would be able to e-mail their teacher and inform them about the issue. It's almost absurd to keep schools opened when there is so much that can be done with a computer and the right resources. This new technology could even help in situations where students and teachers aren't able to attend school due to other concerns.

Although some people may find distance learning problematic because the students wouldn't able to talk to a teacher face to face, and have them correct something by hand, however It's not a valid point because there are even bigger concerns that society is facing today. The Corona Virus has been taking over society and has reached the states. If distance learning is established, viruses could be prevented from spreading. Viruses are easily spread, specially the Corona Virus, which can be transmitted through a simple cough, if one student is infected there is a big chance of it spreading to everyone else in that school alone. In this case, distance learning is necessary for the well being of students, teachers, and other staff members. The number of cases that could eventually lead to death, is increasing each day. It would be tragic if it killed people in school, and it would be even more tragic if it could've been avoided by teaching kids online. It's not worth waiting for a tragedy to happen when there is ways to save a person's life.

Distance learning could be the most beneficial and progressive change in society, it would help so many scholars achieve success. They would be much more invested in their learning and future if this sort of system is established. furthermore, Future societies will be more educated and prepared. Distance learning is the future and it will keep advancing and enhancing the learning system as a whole. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
3404A30E92C7,"Distance Learning can be very beneficial in some aspects, but in others it can be very detrimental to kids and their families. If kids started taking more online classes it could ruin their high school experience. It can also cause them to become very anti-social with them being at home all of the time and not being at school in class. This may also cause them to get in to more trouble with being at home 24/7, which can also lead to kids not doing their work and not graduating because of it. Kids need to go to school so they can have a good experience of high school before college, stay connected with friends so they do not feel left out when they try to speak with people in public and succeed in getting a job for them to make money

Kids can lose their high school experience if taking online classes. There will be no dances that are held for the students that take online classes and they will not be able to participate in regular after school activities. They won't have a homecoming or prom that they can get a date to because of this. This is one of the biggest parts of high school; being able to go to prom and have fun with your friends or significant other. School Dances are meant to be fun, and if they take online courses this is something they can not attend. Another big loss is they won't have the chance to go see big sports events and participate in the crowd while cheering on their team, or even play on the team and create a bond with their teammates. Students will miss out on spirit week which a very special week that everyone in the school looks forward to because everyone loves this week. It is a laid back week of where you decorate floats and class rooms all leading up to the big varsity football game, which they won't be able to have if they take these online classes at home. High school is something you need to experience in life, and if students stayed home and took online classes they wouldn't have an actual high school, so they would be missing out on most things if not everything that happens throughout high school.

This can also hurt students because of them not being in a classroom with other students; they can very easily become very anti-social, and not know how to communicate very well to others. They will not constantly have to talk to teachers or other classmates about work, or have to work on a project in a group, which can help them tremendously with people skills. They generally will not make friends or see any of their friends because of them being at home while their friends are at school, which can cause anti-socialism. They will not be in class interacting with other teachers and students, which can lead to them not having confidence in talking or not wanting to talk to other people or students. This is also just an important thing you need in life cause everything you do will require human interaction when you become an adult and try to get a job. If they can not speak and be comfortable how are they going to do an interview for someone they are trying to work for and probably have never seen before.

Although this can open many doors for students and their families. They will be able to learn at their own pace and not have to try and keep up with the teachers while taking notes or doing work. They might learn better through taking an online course because of them being able to go slower than a teacher would. This can help students from being bullied because they are safe at home away from the kids that might try to bully them if they already don't do it. This can also save the family if the parents are not in a very good financial state at the time of when the kids take the classes because they do not have to take them to school everyday which can cause more gas money, but can also keep them away from bullies on the bus and keep them in a safer environment.

In conclusion, this can be very beneficial to kids because of not having to travel or walk anywhere to go to school, but it also can hurt the students futures, which they need because what they experience now; bad or good, will affect how they act and conduct themselves later. Online classes is something that can be very beneficial, but at the same time can hurt the students in a very bad way and take away their high school experience.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9401DDD45E43,"Can students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Yes, they can benefit from completing their work at home, and here are a few reasons for my position on this issue. Being able to have one on one time with your instructor, being able to work at your own pace ,and not being as social as others.

Firstly, I want to start with I know most people would say that students won't be able to get help. Which brings me to my first reason; being able to have one on one time with their instructors. This can improve the student's ability to understand something their having issues on. Teachers in schools have at least 25 students in their classes. So, when a student is having issues on a subject, it's hard for teachers to be able to teach them everything they need to know in order for them to comprehend the topic, and keep the class entertained and not get rowdy. Learning at home is a great opportunity to receive extra help.

Another reason is being able to work at your own pace. When having so many students in one class it may be hard to receive all the knowledge you need as fast as other students. All students work at different pace, and all students comprehend subjects differently. Most students at my school have this issue as well in class. The students that comprehended the lesson would tell the teacher they were comfortable to move on to another lesson, but other students were not. But instead of holding up the ones that were ready to move on they wouldn't say anything. Which made them fail tests, but if you were home schooled that wouldn't be an issue since there's no one there to rush you.

My final reason is a very common reason why students do home schooling. Which is not being as social as others also called bulling. Lots of people say when students leave school to home school it's going to be hard for them to make friends and learn social skills. My reason for picking this is because students that home school sometimes are being bullied, or can't make friends. It might also be hard to learn in class if their being bullied. I know a student from my school who had a lot of friends and was still bullied. Which made him end up being home schooled. Students that are home schooling because they don't have friends, or are being bullied are doing it because it allows them a comfortable and peaceful learning environment.

Attending classes from home is a great way to receive a better education if going to school isn't working. My reasons: being able to have one on one time, working at your own pace, and not being as social are just a few reasons why I think it is a good idea for students who want to try learning at home. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
2FFBE61E4B84,"Generic_Name is a excellent student, because he has online classes at his home; however, if he only takes classes in the school, it would not benefit to him because he can get distracted by talking with friends during class, and sometimes he likes to mess around with his friends during class. Students would benefit from being able to attend online or video conferencing classes from home, because students can get distracted by talking during class, and some students likes to mess around to get the attention of the other students.

First, students can get distracted by talking during class. For example, my friend Generic_Name has bad grades, because he is working with a group, so everyone in that group are talking instead of working or paying to the class, so Generic_Name needs to attend online or video conferencing classes at his house to recover back his grades. Another example is that my cousin Generic_Name does not like, when the students of his group are talking because he starts to pay attention to the conversation instead of the class, especially when the teacher is giving details about the next test. Furthermore, my friend Generic_Name does not like when the students are talking, so she decided to attend online classes at home and now it benefits to her more than she was attending to classes at school. But unhappily, some people believe that students can work well in groups of class, but they are incorrect because students can get distracted by talking during class.

Second, some students likes to mess around to get the attention of the other students. For example, my friend Generic_Name it is not able to mess around one more time, because if he mess around again, the teacher will get rid of him, so he actually is waiting for his parents to accept the request that he will be attending to classes at home, so he cannot get in trouble with the teacher and his parents. For instance, my neighbor Generic_Name it is a sarcastic guy, he always is trying to get the attention of the other students during class or during a test, so his parents said that he will be attending video conferencing classes at home, and it would be beneficiary for the students and also for Generic_Name. Another example is that my friend Generic_Name does not like his friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name, because Generic_Name and Generic_Name are always trying to mess around with Generic_Name, sometimes Generic_Name and Generic_Name does not let Generic_Name to work alone, especially when they want something from Generic_Name; however, Generic_Name is thinking if it will be better that he will attend online classes at his house, so he can have some progress.

82280B54C392,"The amount pressure that is put on students has dramatically increased recently. Some students have jobs or play sports, and some even do both. Trying to make time for their extra curricular activities, family, friends and school has become a difficult task. Online classes are now offered, and are more ideal for some students considering their daily life. Students should be able to attend class from home because it can reduce stress from social anxiety, allow them to work at their own pace, and can limit certain distractions.

Mental health is a major focus in today's society, and anxiety is a very common disorder. My sister has very bad social anxiety and often has panic attacks about going to school. These episodes can cause her brain to only focus on her anxiety and cause her to not be aware of what is going on around her, thus distracting her form actually learning and focusing on school. By attending school online, from the comfort of our home, my sister is able to focus on her school work and not worry about the social aspect of school.

Another reason why attending school from home can be beneficial is because students can work at their own pace. Sometimes a ninety minute block is not enough time for someone to understand a concept. If they are doing class online, they can spend some extra time in that area and better understand what is being taught. This would be especially useful for students with activities other than school. If they understand a concept really well, they should not have to sit in school and relearn it when other students do not understand, while they could be doing something more productive. The extra time could be spent working or doing a little extra training for a sport they love.

Lastly, online school could be beneficial because it can limit distractions. While in school, kids may start talking to their peers instead of doing the work or paying attention, and this can lead to a decrease in their test scores. If a student was at home, they could sit in a quiet room and put all of their attention towards their school work. Other distractions may also be limited, such as drama going on at school, which can cause kids to get into fights or only think about the incident that just occurred. Again, if the student was in a quiet room working on school, these unnecessary distractions could be avoided.

Although many people believe school is a place for a child to grow and learn about the real world, the point that the school system pushes is for the child to pass the class and excel just with the curriculum given to them. There are other events that can teach a child about the real world, such as getting a job or doing an activity they are passionate about. With extra time from limiting distractions that would happen at school, a child would have more time to do those things. In the end, online school would be beneficial for students in many ways such as improving their mental health and creating an environment where a student can be more productive rather than if they were at school. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EDACE717C302,"In the age of computers and instantaneous communication, society has an incredible amount knowledge available to them. That said, instead of learning with just pen and paper, why can we not also incorporate online learning into our school systems? I believe that students would benefit significantly from being able to attend classes from home because it better accommodates students, helps supplement learning for home schooled students, as well as giving students the option to take more of their desired classes online.

Online learning accommodates students with disabilities as well as students with injuries that may prevent them from easily leaving their homes. It is unfair that our education system would require that they come to school when they can learn the same, or potentially more information from home. Recently, it has become clear that online learning is feasible for an entire school. Take for example, schools in Italy or South Korea. These countries have temporarily closed their schools until April in order to better combat the novel corona virus, COVID-19. That said, the schools are still holding lessons online where attendance is taken and students are given the same education by the same teachers, only through a computer screen. If it is feasible for other nations to accommodate for their students during a health epidemic then surely we can also implement a similar program for our students during times of peace. Furthermore, we can not, both morally and legally, allow for our disabled students to receive a sub par education than their peers. That is a disservice not only to them but the moral foundation and integrity of the community as a whole. Similarly, students with mental illnesses like depression or anxiety are more likely to be productive and learn in an online setting than they are in the classroom. Offering this alternative option to these students will undoubtedly benefit in them being more productive as well as allowing more time for these individuals to seek professional help or therapy then they would normally be able to, potentially decreasing the amount of teenagers with mental illnesses in the United States and at the same time increasing the graduation rate.

A unique aspect of American public education is the fact that a large number of families choose the home school their children rather than send them to a public or private school. Of course, the success and effectiveness varies drastically from household to household but most generally follow a simple, bare bones public school curriculum with little or no instruction from a professionally licensed teacher. If online learning or video conferencing was made available to home schooled students and be used as a supplement to a child's learning, then it will benefit the student's education. Also, many school districts already offer online classes that are supervised by school staff that focus mostly on students learning the course material at their own pace. Take Generic_School's VISION program for example. VISION offers LCPS as well as non-LCPS students many different courses from English and math, to economics and personal finance. If home schooled students could join some of these courses, there will definitely be many benefits for both parties, not least of which is producing students who will advance our country and the world.

Continuing off of the description of Generic_Schools' VISION program, many students in this area feel that they can do a lot more with their education and choose to take classes online in addition to the classes they already take at school. Instead of being overwhelmed in the school building with all of these extra classes, students find it much more convenient and easier to take certain classes from home and at their own pace. Personally, I currently take economics and personal finance online using VISION in order to meet a graduation requirement for my county and find that I am having a much easier time learning the material than other students do in school. Another benefit of online classes is that they are essential for students who wish to take advantage of the fact that all of the courses at public schools are free. Many students take classes pertaining to IT and computer science online in order to gain a complex understanding of these fields and go on to major in these related fields. On the other hand, critics of online learning may say that there are public academies for students who wish to specialize in STEM careers or pursue the humanities and that it is better for students to learn in a formal classroom setting rather than from at home. These arguments do not factor in students who are not competitive enough to apply for academies, cannot afford to, or simply do not wish to attend these academies. It should not be an expectation for students who simply wish to pursue their interests to enter an extremely competitive and difficult environment for the same education that they could receive through less traumatic means. Although institutions like Generic_School of Science and Technology boost a student's resume, they are wholly unnecessary for students who just want to take a couple extra classes and maybe receive some extra credits.

Although formal classroom education has been -and still remains- the standard of public education, as our society moves more and more towards complete digitization of daily life, our system of education should also keep pace and be made to offer distance learning as an option for all students for better students' accommodation, education, and choice in their education. Since this education will last our students a lifetime, we should never falter in giving them the quality education that they are entitled to in the Constitution of this great nation.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
2F3210D23414,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier.

Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house.

Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Some students just do it to finish high school earlier, they have the opportunity on taking classes online during the summer and be able to get less classes on their senior year or just graduate earlier if they taking the standard diploma, that is a smart thing to do if you are planing on go to college and finish your carrier on a young age, and start working at young age too.

On my opinion I think that having that opportunity is a good thing and a bad thing because going to school is the best decision that you can make on your life, you get to make friends and get to know a lot of people during all the time you spend at school, but not everyone have that opportunity, thats why this opportunity that the school is giving you is unique and can help you a lot, the only thing you need is a computer or a electronic device that can get access to the internet.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

CLASSES FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE OR VIDEO CONFERENCING. DO YOU THINK

STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES FROM HOME:

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Parents do not want their children to attend classes from home. Students will not get much benefits, whoever if they live in a place that is far away from school or they can't attend school for any reason then its has benefits. I'm not agree that students should attend classes from home because students can have stress, students can not pay attention very well, and the most important fact is that it will affect on students' grades.

The first reason is that the students can get stressed everyone time whenever they attend the class online because i know that its not easy to take classes online. students have to pay more attention. They can not understand very well by online or on video conference. It will be hard for students to learn or to understand their lesson online. Students will be stressed out because no one will be there to help them, not any teacher and either any friend (any other student).

The second reason why students should not take classes at home is that they will not able to pay attention by taking online classes. it does not feel like the school environment. students will spent more time on their school. At least in schools we pay more attention than doing our homework at home, because we mostly spend our time on our devices (cell phone) and on the television by watching episodes, cartoon movies, other movies, and etc.

The third reason is that it also affect on students grades and in the future they can not attend their favorite college. They won't able to understand the lesson, they will get bad grades in all subjects. It is so important to attend the classes at school, then you will know what is going on. students can ask teachers if they are having problems in their lesson. teachers can help them during school timing or after school. It will be easy for students to understand or to pay attention and they can get good grades too in all their subjects.

Students should not take classes at home. It will affect on their grades because they will not able to pay attention, they will get stressed out because if student need help, no one will be there to help them for their studies or their lessons, and it will be hard to pay attention at house by doing online studies. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

The students can cheat in their work from class and then they would not learn anything what the teacher teach to him and to the students, and the teacher would not be able every time to help them in their work because, is a lot of students who need a lot of help sometimes, and i think the teacher would be busy with the other students. and the students would not assist to class because of that things.

The students need to learn about education and society because if they don have that in life after school would be hard to improve because they don't know how people can be,or maybe they wont like how their teacher are teaching them because they have ones in the computer in online they dont really know the teacher or whos teaching them or if its correct how they are teaching them because if you dont understand the teacher there is other teacher who can help you with it and solve your problems in school you have and like in my country you think school is your other house and the teacher are like you second mothers because they are teaching you like you parents teach to you

One time i was in a online class doing a video call and, the teacher wasn't there sometimes when i need help in my work. And it was like ten people in my class, it was very distracting because, everyone was talking at the same time in the video call. And i couldn't listen well to the teacher. Then i didn't learn well because she was busy. This was in summer school, it was just one month but in my opinion i didn't learn that much i learn more when i was in summer school but in a class room with the teacher and the students in side.

Must of the times their was students they would not there sometimes, and it wasn't like one or two sometimes was more. And the calls wasn't that much of stressful because it wasn't that much of students. And you can learn much better with out them because the teacher has more time for you. the students when they don't go to the class room in school must of the times is because, they don't like how the teacher teach to them but thats a really big problem. Some teachers know you skip their class or others, they don't want to explain you because the student is not there must of the times but the students need to learn in life some times you don't choose your things, like know in school your counselor can help you whit it, change the student with another teacher but when they go to college they do not have that option.

I don't thing is a good idea to have the classes online because when you go to school you learn about responsibility. And how you can improve in a good way how you are, how responsibility you need to be in life, have respect with other people, with your teacher and the other students. You can improve something you want to be after your done with school, like if you are good with society, you can learn in school that you can be a person who likes to talk a lot and you can choose in your life to be a reporter and in school they're programs and classes you can choose, so you can learn more about it.

For been in school you make your life, your own decisions of what you want to be in a future. Find your hobbies your passions. You can make friends in school you can be in contact with them in your live. Know new people from other countries learn about their culture how their are. How people can be in different forms of attitudes and different types of people are in the world.

The programs of the schools at home are not good for people who likes to be in society wants to learn about other stuff, learn of how is society. You can learn about math,science,sports,everything you want but i think learning at school is a better idea for those people wants to really learn what they want to be. Thats why schools are for help, teach and have learn about education for your future.

In my conclusion, for me classes online is not a good idea i don't think students would be benefit being to attend classes from home because is not a good for them. If people lives far away from their schools or they dont have who can take them the Government or the community of the schools should still sending buses to pick up those students. They need to make a solution how students can came and have education. Because education is important in life and been in school it is great. Their is programs of school in house but i dont think is a good idea we need to be in society, we need people who can help us at the time we need, like in the class room teacher know how to teach to their students they studied for that. And going to school you have programs clubs if you like to be helping, studying, or doing sports, and know new people,learn things you even't know about it, or improve your self for you or for your future. Classes online, if is just you and the teacher i think it would be good but still a problem their is not a lot of teachers can teach to every single student,and the students they won't know have a social life and know new people.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
3FC093EFB96C,"You are sitting in your chair. The plastic hurts your legs and back as it curves in an uncomfortable position, ill-adapted to your person. The intolerable buzz of the air conditioning that does nothing to cool the over-heated room drones at your ears, making it impossible to focus. The dull, artificial bulbs that in no way compensate for natural sunlight burn away at your eyes, giving you headache after headache. The other kids are yelling and blasting music, talking instead of doing the work you have been told to complete in an unreasonable, almost impossible time. The work you are doing makes no sense to you and you feel incompetent as those around you breeze by effortlessly. You need to ask the teacher about your work but shes busy grading papers, paying no attention to the class you have been forced into. You can not focus on a single word of your assignment, and even if you could understand it, you would not be able to complete it, because that same day youve already had three tests and two quizzes and all you want is to go home and take a short nap to recharge your brain. You long for some solution to your endless problems in the classroom, and you realize there is another way. Learning from home can solve all these problems and more. With the ability to work online, you not only have the comfort of being at home, but also have more flexibility in your schedule, can learn at your own pace, and can eliminate almost any distractions.

First and foremost, being able to work in a comfortable environment is crucial to focusing and being able to produce the best work possible. While at school, students are being crammed into small classrooms with masses of other students, leaving each individual cramped. With only a square foot of desk space to write on, and the inability to move freely due to the molecule ratio of classroom size to students present, students are unable to concentrate on a given task. Scientists have proven through various studies that being comfortable while working has a direct effect on ones ability to produce quality work. By giving students the opportunity to work away from school, the comforts of home will aid in excelling the learning process. Students are also fed ill-nutritious foods in unnaturally short lunch periods, causing masses of students to consume foods that decrease brain power. When students are given less then 15 minutes to stuff their faces with greasy carbs before being shoved back into their classrooms, the students ability to work is compromised in ways like never before. By allowing students to work at home, they also have access to more nutritious food with reasonable eating periods.

In addition to comfort, working with a more flexible schedule also benefits students. In high school, students are often faced with the dilemma of an overwhelming amount of tests, quizzes, or projects due on a single day. Working online with a more flexible schedule, allows a student to space out assignments as needed, improving the quality and ability to learn from each one. In addition to this, the student can also plan their learning around their personal life, and allows the student to create a schedule that does not force them to chose between an important test and seeing family that visits only once a year. The ability to have more flexibility is also scientifically proven to improve learning in scenarios at school where students are forced to sit for hours at a time. Scientists have shown that teens can only focus for hour long intervals with 30 minute breaks in between. At school, classes are, on average, one and a half hours with only seven minute breaks in between. This shows how much an online approach to schooling can greatly benefit students.

Not only can online learning provide much needed flexibility, but it also allows students to learn at their own pace. Some students are faster in some subjects then others, and even within subjects, students may struggle with different learning objectives. The freedom of learning online allows students to work at a pace that is comfortable for them. This by itself eliminates assignments such as ""busy work"" given to students that fully understand the material faster then others. This also allows students to fully understand the material before moving on, instead of rushing to keep up with a class that is moving to fast to allow a struggling student to keep up. Some students are very intelligent and work well in higher level classes, but simply need slightly more time to practice and understand concepts then others, which is a matter that online classes solve completely.

Finally, online schooling allows for the removal of distractions that are commonly found in the classroom. At every school, there is always a group of individuals that have no interest in being at school, and focus all of their efforts into disrupting the class. At home, you can not only rid yourself of these students who curse loudly, blast music throughout the halls and classrooms, and often start fights in the middle of class, but also other distractions such as the droning artificial lights and loud air conditioning. Schools have small budgets for large amounts of students and this causes the school to make financial choices that sacrifice quality school equipment, such as quieter air-conditioning and plumbing that doesnt shake the walls of surrounding classrooms every time someone needs to relieve themselves.

While some may say that giving a student these freedoms leaves them at greater risk for slacking off completely, they dont take into consideration that once these downfalls of the school system have been fixed by online schooling, students can see and enjoy firsthand what learning the the right environment can be like. Students will want to learn. Students will want to experience the joy of knowledge. Online schooling prevents all of the downfalls of the school system while highlighting the positive aspects, allowing students to greatly benefit.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
1CCEDB8144D5,"Students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home rather then at school. Imagine being able to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. You wouldnt have to worry about getting ready in the morning or if there's gas in your car because you don't have to leave the house. Although, some say its more beneficial to attend classes from school because, students can get easily distracted when they are at home believe that there's no teachers to tell them to get back on task.

However, there's more reasons for students to attend classes from home rather then at school. The first reason is it helps student save a lot of money. For example, having to put gas into your car whenever it runs out isnt cheap. If all of the money wasnt used up for gas it could be later used for something better. Another example, would be lunch money because students complain about not liking the taste of the food or that they cant afford it. If students were able to work from home they can provide their own tasty lunch. Also if they werent using up their money for gas they could save that money to buy food in the afternoon or whenever they are hungry.

Another reason, is that it can help students gain more sleep during the day because for school students have to wake up an hour or two early to get ready. If students are working from home they can get up thirty minutes before the video conference to prepare since, they dont have to take a whole hour or two to decide on what to wear. This extra sleep can help students gain more energy to help them throughout the day. Whenever the student has finished their school work they can go get other things done.

The third reason, would be that students can be able to learn how to provide their own schedule and work time. Also schools wouldnt get excuses like they were late to class because of traffic on their way to school. Students themselves will have enough time to eat breakfast and make it to the video conference on time since students are at home they dont have to drive anywhere. There wouldnt be any missing assignment if the student is sick because they can get their work done at home.

In conclusion, some say its more beneficial to attend classes from school because students can easily get distracted. However, students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home rather then at school. It helps students save a lot of money because they dont have to use their cars to attend classes or waste money on food they dont want to eat. It also can help students not feel sleep deprive and instead help them gain more energy throughout the day. There wouldnt be any absent or late students because they can get any work done at home or whenever they have the time.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4790D181C8D5,"From the time we were young children, like around the age of five, we were brought up that school was a necessity and that we had to go. Me, being a black girl and all,my parents always reminded me that my assessors fought for us to go to school: ""And you have no right not to go"". Up until 2017 all we ever knew was that public school is the only way you can get your education. Now, all that's changed, there's talk about distance learning; which is a way students can attend class from home by online courses, or video conferencing. Allowing students to attend classes from home is a big mistake because it'll make cheating more frequent, it deprives students of a teacher forcing them to teach themselves, and it prevents them from obtaining social skills.

School is about educating yourself, so you can take on the great big world. When students decide to do distance learning, they take on the decision to learn everything themselves. Yes there are plenty of online videos and teachers you can watch in order to learn the information needed for testing, but who's to say that they're giving one-hundred percent correct information. There are literally whole human beings that will willingly teach over seventy-five students each day just for you're convenience. When I was younger my teachers used to score my writings with a three out of five or either a two out of five. That may not seem that bad, but from a girl who gets four out of five or five out of five on essays now, that's such an accomplishment. Of course I can't give myself all the credit because I know that it was my former teachers who built me to become the writer that I am now. Teachers literally made a writer out of a girl who couldn't even spell ""great"" correctly. Without teachers life is hard, and educating yourself will deprive you of the learning experiences like the ones that I encountered.

Having children to complete all assignments at home is very dangerous. Especially when they're left to test on their own. When left to test during distance learning there's nobody around to check whether you're actually learning the information or not. You could easily cheat on an at home test and not even know what you're being tested on. Once again the students partaking in this at home learning are depriving themselves of their learning abilities, this time by cheating. Cheating is never good, we learned that in school, and it gets you nowhere in life. At home distance learning opens the idea that it's fine to cheat when no one is watching. Do we really want the people that will soon lead this country to think that it isn't a big deal to cheat?

Adult figures, parents more than likely, had always made it clear that school is for work and not to socialize with friends. Well, I know mine did. My mom used to always get upset when she'd get an email home stating that I, Generic_Name, was being very talkative in class today. Besides the point, school made me become a social butterfly and it opened me up to a whole world of new and inviting ideas. It literally made part of who I am today. Without socializing and interacting with other students at school I would've still been lost or undecided in what I would like to do for my future. At first I was a shy little girl, but very talkative with only the people I knew personally. School taught me social skills at a very young age which allowed me to be comfortable around others, and it opened me up to be inviting to people I don't even know. See, children benefit off of public schools, but at home distance learning can't really benefit children in this area. Distance learning allows you to be by yourself, which isn't very good all the time. Too much time spent alone learning information by yourself can cause you to become a hermit, or even worse, it can cause you depression.

Some may say that distance learning is way more beneficial than public schools because you can learn at your own pace, you dont have to deal with any distractions, and it keeps you safe. While that may be true, distance learning can still cause major problems when you actually look at it. Home schooling, distance learning or whatever you want to call it is really allowing are kids to be lazy when it comes to learning. We are literally giving our kids a crutch right before our eyes and we don't even see it. Children need to stay in public schools and not participate in the at home distance learning. It isn't helping, nor benefiting the children of today's time. These we'll soon become the leaders of society. We need them woke an able to stand on their own two feet without this crutch that we're giving them, and to do that public school is the best option for the children of today.

8E572B0D4250,"Students, having the ability to attend classes from home by video conferencing, will be beneficial to students and teachers because it allows them to save time and money. Schools worldwide should make online courses an option for everyone, it will give students time to do as they want without being restricted to sitting in classes for 8 or more ours doing the same activities everyday. The idea of being able to work home allows students to work in an environment theyÃÂ´re comfortable without any distractions whether they have transportation to school or not,this will give students the opportunity to sleep in more and not restrict them from enjoying time while they learn. The main reason i believe online courses will help is productiveness the students can do work at any place with local networking and will allow them to complete assignments and turn them in whenever they feel this will also save money, wasted money for public transportation could be used to provide students with a laptop and internet.

Teachers are always stressed with grading assignments on time but, not anymore online grading can be automated and uploaded within seconds. Parenting teachers can stay home with their children without worry something will happen while working. In conclusion online courses will allow teachers and students to enjoy themselves while also working.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
866B61E17B7D,"Distance learning has been growing in popularity recently, and many people are arguing that it should be used instead of traditional schooling. However, I believe that distance learning would be detrimental to students because it takes away the physical connections between students, teachers, and peers, it allows students to slack off on their work, and online learning is not a reliable way to teach students.

When students do their learning online they are looking at a teacher, or their work through a screen which completely takes away the physical connection between the student and their teacher. This physical connection is important because it allows students to build relationships with their teachers, and the teachers can understand the student at a deep level. Students would also not be able to ask questions or receive help as easy as in a traditional school because in school all they have to do is raise their hand, but online they have to go through a much tougher process to get assistance. Distance learning would also hinder a students' ability to work with their peers on projects because they lose the benefit of communicating in person, and building a strong relationship in order to work together as a strong group.

Giving students the ability to learn online from the comfort of their own home puts a lot of trust in these students to actually get work done, but many of these students will choose to misuse this trust and slack off on their work. For example, if a student had the ability to sleep in longer or play video games instead of doing their schoolwork, many students would put schoolwork at a lower priority than these choices. This gives students the power to just not do their work and lose a lot of their motivation to continue working. Another question that needs to be asked of online learning is who would punish these students who slack off and choose to not do their work? If these irresponsible students did not care about getting their work done when they had to go to school, then why would they care about it when they can stay home and enjoy other things?

A strong defense for online learning is that it makes education more accessible to students who can't go to school for reasons such as not being able to afford it. Distance learning is also very simple because all you need is a device that can access the internet and the internet itself. Although distance learning does have these benefits of being simple and accessible, online learning is vulnerable and can not be trusted to reliably give students an education. There are many reasons why online learning is not reliable: the online learning platform can be hacked, a student's internet could not work properly, or the system could be too slow to handle many students being on it. These are big issues that are not uncommon and if they happened to someone who solely used online learning as their way of getting an education, then they would have no way to continue learning.

Getting rid of the physical connections, giving students too much trust that they will misuse, and online learning itself not being reliable are all reasons why I believe that students would not benefit from distance learning. Instead of switching to distance learning, we can instead try to reform traditional schools in order to give students a better place to learn and make learning more enjoyable for them.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
046C6FB91CBA,"Distance learning can be very helpful to students who cannot attend classes at school like other students. Although distance learning can effect students losing focuses in their classes, nevertheless, learning away from school can help us the students to have less stress, and giving us an opportunity to take care of our brothers and sisters and attending classes without skipping classes.

Almost everyone in school is stressing about something,so attending classes online would help a lot. For example: It gives us more time to finish our work for other class and stress less, because to me having the advantage to attend online classes would help out a lot, and also i might have other classes to worry about. so having an option for us the students to attend class from home by using online or video conferencing might not sound the worst. And could help students who are suffering from anxiety and having any type of stress. By using online classes they could listen to music to clam themselves down and not having any signs of a panic attack, because in school not every class or teachers might let the students use their phone to listen to music; they might not be able to know if the student is having a panic attack, but at home if they are attending classes online and having a panic attack their parents would be there to help them clam down.

Most students need to stay home in order to help with family emergence. Research has show that almost 50% of the time if the student is not at school, then they are at home helping out with their siblings at home, doing that they skipping school and losing an education, but with online classes they can do both without skipping class or missing anything in school. Because with online class the information they need would be provided to them, if they have a laptop or computer and in case they do not have any of these technology they can just go to their local Library with their siblings and do their assessments with no worries, because their siblings would find some kind of fun to do at the library.

In conclusion attending classes online at home would benefit a lot for us the students because in case some thing happens at home they just go online at do their work without stress about losing points, to me personal attending classes online would be very helpful because I would have to stress a lot, can skip school and get some sleep.     ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
AD9DF5656D88,"In our society, many things have changed over time. Whether it be the way we communicate or how we shop, we are becoming more efficient. However, a major piece of our lives has remained the same; that being, our education. Children and young adults today are learning the same way their parents and grandparents did. While standard teaching and learning techniques are still beneficial to education, they are becoming outdated. Distance learning is a relatively new technique that many schools don't offer, and I feel that this should change. This option allows kids in school to attend class from home ""by way of online or video conferencing."" By offering distance learning to students, we will ultimately improve their experiences in school. School can be extremely stressful, and many students will agree with that statement. Coursework can be both demanding and exhausting. Distance learning is an option that is extremely beneficial due to the fact that it prevents excessive absences, minimizes distractions, and makes learning more appealing to students.

Attendance is a major key to getting a great education. By missing class time, students miss valuable lessons that oftentimes can only be regained by attending after-school tutorials or make-up sessions. One thing we must consider, however, is sometimes a student is physically unable to attend school. This could be due to any number of sicknesses, injuries, or hospitalization. By allowing distance learning to be an option, students will be able to attend classes, therefore preventing inconvenient make-up work and keeping them on the same page as their fellow classmates. Attendance is also key to maintaining the accreditation of a school. Personally, my school is struggling with this. While some students are deliberately skipping classes and school days, others are missing valuable class time due to being sick or unable to attend that day. If my school offered distance learning, I am confident that it would dramatically increase our attendance rate and prevent us from losing accreditation.

Oftentimes, a classroom setting is not always the best environment for children and teenagers to learn in. Excessive noise and chatter from surrounding students can prevent them from obtaining all the information provided in a lesson. This also negatively effects the teacher. By making their job more difficult, it increases the potential for the waste of class time. They are also forced to spend time disciplining those who are being defiant, instead of being able to focus on teaching. With distance learning, students are able to create their own learning environment. This shifts their focus from trying to block out others, to focusing on the lesson. By improving the surroundings needed for a student to succeed, they will begin to enjoy learning and look forward to the next lesson. Teachers and administrative employees must also keep in mind that a student's mental health is vital to them being able to focus in school. Sometimes, social environments can be too overwhelming for students, negatively impacting them. Distance learning provides the opportunity to take a ""mental health day"" while still attending class.

Another benefit of the distance learning option is that it ultimately improves the school experience. Instead of kids being overwhelmed with stress, they are able to have more control over their education and discover what works best for them. This allows them to develop a better understanding of themselves, which is important in everyday life. Understanding what works for you, and what does not, allows you to be more efficient and productive in life. While distance learning is a privilege that can be easily abused, that does not mean it shouldn't be implemented. School administration will have to establish rules, as well as punishments, to encourage students to understand that the intention of distance learning is to improve education, not allow them to skip school. By not allowing young adults and children the option to attend class from home, we are restricting their ability to learn. The goal of teachers is to free the mind of students, not hold it back.

Distance learning is a technique that is current and should be implemented in schools today. It benefits students in many ways, varying from reducing stress to making education more appealing. Demanding coursework is easier to manage when kids have the means necessary to balance it with other things that may be going on in their lives. It strengthens the educational foundation of young adults, making them eager to learn and ready for the next challenge. By making modern changes to education and the way we learn, we are becoming an increasingly more efficient society. Allowing attendance from home, creating an effective learning environment, and improving the experience of school are only a few of the ways distance learning is beneficial to students. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DBE16C234CF3,"The twenty-first century is something different from past generations. Nowadays technology has made it easy to adapt and allowed for a more evolved teaching environment. Although technology is already put into use in most classrooms, a new debate has come forth involving schools allowing students to ""attend"" classes through online or video conferencing. Giving students the opportunity to participate in a class virtually is not beneficial because it will increase cheating, lower motivation and work ethic, and prevent students from forming social skills.

The generations in school right now are being taught in a way that has never done before. Every student with access to technology has an abundant amount of information at the edge of their fingertips. This has made students get lazy, and not worry about completing their work because all they have to do is simply type the title of their assigned work and answer sheets will show up. Cheating has been, and will continue to be a big problem in schools all over the country. New soft wares are being developed everyday with the sole purpose of helping students cheat. If a student is taking a class online in the comfort of their own home, they will access those soft wares and have a significantly lower chance of being caught since there is no teacher around. The fact that the class is based online means that students can easily find answers to a quiz or test given to them just by opening a new tab on their browser. There are different techniques used to prevent students from being able to access other browsers while on the virtual classroom but those students are still allowed access to their cellphone. In this generation kids, and teenagers especially are always connected. All of your friends and family are just a button away. If all schools included online school as an option for students, they would be able to use different types of technology not including their computers. If certain measures are taken so different browsers are not accessible during virtual classes, technology like apple watches, tablets, cellphones make it not only make it possible to use the internet, but also give students opportunities to socialize with their friends and share answers in that sense. Virtual classes will raise the amount of cheating done and affect the students negatively.

One problem in schools is that after the first semester, or even first quarter, students start experiencing academic burn-outs. Many students dread waking up each morning, but they find the motivation to wake up and attend school because it is on an implemented schedule. Being in a classroom environment helps students strive to be more like the others around them. Students at SCHOOL_NAME were given the option to enroll in semester based online class and more than half the students fell behind. The students progressively got more lazy and stopped finding the time to complete their online classwork. The lack of structure in online classes will negatively affect students since they are no longer forced to show up to class on time to complete their work. A new upcoming study shows that doing schoolwork where relaxation takes place, causes work ethic to decrease. Many students will do the virtual class from the comfort of their bed or couch. Simply being in that environment versus being at a desk and chair, will inevitably cause students to doze off and fall asleep. Distance learning will affect motivation and work ethic in students tremendously.

Humans are wired to be social, it is what they were born to do. Schools have created an environment where students can socialize and make bonds with the people in their communities. Social skills learned in school are vital to be successful in the future. If students were allowed to do their classes online, it takes away their ability to form those skills. The online classes would isolate the students and negatively impact the way they function in later stages of their life. Kids who are more social have less mental health issues. Being able to go to school and be surrounded with friends and people they know allows students to be happier overall. Staying home and doing your class from there would take that away from kids and the lack of socializing will cause an increase in loneliness. The aspect of personally going into school has shaped the way people will perform in the real world.

Although some may argue that online school is a better way of learning for them, it is clear that online school will not only cause short term problems, but also long term. If more students were enrolled in online classes performance rates will go down, cheating will be a bigger problem, and students mental health will be negatively impacted. It is time to stop allowing today's generation to rely on technology, and implement things that will prepare them for the real world.                           ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

Many students do not enjoy spending all of their time during the day at school and would rather have the option to stay at home and learn. Despite the fact that people say students would not benefit from being able to take classes from home, the reality is that students would indefinitely benefit from being able to attend classes online and at home because students can relax while learning, have more free time, and can work at their own pace.

Above all, students benefit from being able to learn from home because they have the ability to relax while learning. If a student is relaxed, they will be in a better mood, which will cause them to learn more efficiently. Survey says that 89% of students would rather be relaxed while learning, instead of going to school, sit in a chair all day, and listen to their teacher speak. A high schooler's dream is to stay in bed all day and relax. If they have the ability to learn from home, a student's dream will come true.

Also of note, students benefit from being able to learn from home because they have more free time. Free time to students is extremely important. Free time can be spent with family, exercising, or even hanging out with friends, which are all very important activities for a high school student. If students were forced to sit in a classroom all day, there is no time to do those activities. Additionally, teachers give a lot of work to students and sometimes, there isn't any free time after school to even talk to their families! Students need free time to survive and having the ability learn from home is a perfect solution.

Furthermore, students benefit from being able to learn from home because they can work at their own pace. Teachers nowadays enjoy rushing through topics. Very often, students do not pick up on the topics because they get far behind, which causes them to stress. With online classes from home, students have the ability to work at their own pace which will not only reduce stress, but will greatly improve their learning.

Overall, students would indefinitely benefit from being able to attend classes online and at home because students can relax while learning, have more free time, and can work at their own pace. This affects almost everyone because students that have the ability to stay home are always happy. You know what they say, if a student is happy, everyone around them will be happy. Go ahead and shoot an email to your local principal to recommend the idea of giving students the ability to take classes from home because it will make you happy, and everyone else happy!",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
4618DCF43061,"Today in the Twenty-One Century, school is one of the most important facts in our lives, to improve ourselves. Now with the help and evolution of the technology, the way to study is been update, in the couple years; by making more easy the learning of the students. In the actuality our major source is the Internet, most of the people can get access to it from a electronic device. Schools have to adapt and change their programs of learning, by this cause. But also it makes more easy to the teachers, to teach.

Some institutions as University, college, has created a new program of online or video conferencing learning, this means that you are able attend classes from home, by using a Cell phone, tablet, computer or any electronic device. This program is made it for the students that lives far from the school, doesn't have to drive for hours, or has a job, even for those that want to try new things in their life.

Students may benefit in certain ways in online school, the students have the option of choose their own flexible schedule, hours, days, they want to take classes at any time of the day, Also most of the colleges and careers are too expensive, is another reason to choosing online program is more lower costs and debts. This program represent self-discipline and responsibility that students have to adapt and take it seriously, no transportation need it the students is authorized to study at home, and not come to the institution.

But also online programs has disadvantages, that the students need to know before they applied, little less face interactions, while you are interacting by the tutor, the device and you. The responsibility depends on the student, on how much effort you are putting while studying, lack of accreditation and low quality, intense requirements for self direction, also is more distractions while you are at home, for example the TV, cell phone, cars crossing the street. Is the importance resposability and care about the school.

Online programs have been upgrade the regular way to study, but depends on the student to continue and try hard to update each day. Is on you the effort that you made to get the ""A"" on your notes, by making all your assignment, homework at the time.

4F26841CD3C8,"Some schools have begun to offer distance learning as an alternative for students to take classes at home through online or video conferencing. I feel that many students would benefit from a distance learning course because it allows them to learn in a private and comfortable setting, the students would have more time to complete their assignments, and it would allow them to do the work on a more flexible schedule.

First, students would be able to work from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. In doing so many students would have less distractions, due to the fact that there would be very few people to keep them from focusing on their work. They also would not have to worry about being judged for what they wear to their classes because there would be no one to comment on what they are wearing. They could also do the work wherever they feel comfortable, if they really felt like it they could lay in bed and work.

Second, students would be given more time to complete their assignments. With them being given more time to work on the assignments the deadlines, for the assignments, would be even better. Students would not be restrained by a bell schedule to complete their work. And if they have any questions they could talk to their teacher directly rather than having to wait for the teacher to finish with another student.

Third, the schedule for the students would be a lot more flexible than having to go to specific classes at specific times. Students wouldn't have a specific time they are required to be attending their classes. They are able to work on the assignments whenever they have time to. And they can leave the assignment and come back to it at another time, rather than being required to finish one assignment to move onto another.

In conclusion, I feel that schools making distance learning available to all students would help benefit the ability of each and every student because it would allow students who want a more private work environment to do so in the comfort of their own home while also giving the students more time and a more flexible schedule.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FD9C10176D2A,"Technology and its uses have greatly evolved over time. One hundred years ago, the concept of the radio was just being introduced while today we have forms of portable communication such as phones, tablets and laptops. As this technology advances, so do its uses. These types of technologies have increasing use in businesses and in schools. With the new developments of technology in schools comes the debate over whether or not students should be able to attend their classes online and at home instead of at school. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home as seen through the different environment, the access to supplies, and the freedom it provides.

First, working on schoolwork at home vs. in school creates two very different environments. While the school environment is crowded and strict, the home environment is more comfortable. As a student who works on my schoolwork both in and out of school, I find that I am able to focus better when at home. At school I am distracted by friends, conversations, and other students, while at home I am able to focus more on my schoolwork than the distractions around me. My home environment is also much more comfortable than school, which clears my mind and helps me focus as well. Because some students are able to learn more efficiently in a more comfortable environment, the option to take classes online would greatly benefit their education. A student who is more focused and able to work hard on their schoolwork generally gets better grades, which will open up more possibilities for his or her future.

While the home environment can be easier to focus in, it also allows a greater access to supplies. At school, students have to bring the supplies that they want to use. However, this can be a problem because of limited space and forgetfulness. Many friends of mine often ask if I have certain supplies such as a stapler, colored pencils, or erasers. While I sometimes do have these supplies, I don't always because of the limited space in my backpack. However, taking classes online at home would eliminate this problem. Instead of having to remember and worrying about having enough space to bring supplies to and from school, students could always have the supplies available in their own home. This way, students also wouldn't have to worry about forgetting notebooks, textbooks, or folders at home when they need them for school because the supplies would always be in one place.

Finally, taking classes at home online would offer students the freedom to work at their own pace. In the classroom, different students have different abilities and different levels of understanding in various subjects. For example, while I tend to have a higher understanding in math, some of my friends do better in history and others in science. However, at school we are all forced to work at the same pace, no matter our ability level, because all the classes need to stay together. Taking online classes would allow students to not worry about others and their ability and instead only focus on their own work. This greater focus on themselves rather than others could also improve students' grades in classes they are struggling with.

While some people may think that students wouldn't learn well without face to face lessons from teachers, this is not true. Last summer, I took the online course of Economics and Personal Finance. While I admit that I was a little hesitant at first about how much I would learn in an online course, my fears were quickly swept away as I began the course. I learned a lot through the online class, and when it came time to come in and take the final test for the class at school, I did really well. While I did not learn face to face with a teacher, if I had any questions, the option was always open to email the teacher, and he would answer any questions I had.

The option to complete classes at home and online would greatly benefit students. It would offer more opportunities and lead to a better focus on the course because of the different environment, the access to supplies, and the freedom to work at your own pace. Allowing students to take online classes is a good way to improve education as well as assimilate new technologies into the school environment. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
6FF1769D744A,"Is home a place to escape from all the learning and stress students acquire at school or is it becming the new classroom? Education online is becoming a popular and easier way for anyone to earn the general studies or degree required by the law. While some prefer distanced learning because of it's many convenient aspects, there are more negative impacts from attending class at home rather than learning in a place of education.

First of all, education at public or private schools can help with a student's social capabilities and mental health. Any student that goes to school will always have a full building with peers and companions to socialize with. Although these friends can sometimes be a distraction, it is better to have a social life rather than learning at home alone. When being surrounded by friends or classmates, it helps open students to knew ideas while improving their communication and collaboration skills. These skills will be fundamental tools for what the future holds of each student. Having friends in a stressful environment like school tends to help keep a pupil in a joyful mood which leads to better understanding of curriculums for each class. Also, when struggling during a moment of misunderstading, classmates and teachers are always willing to provide their bits of knowledge to help one better understand confusing curriculum. For example, when getting assigned a group project, classtime is for the most part given so groups can collaborate and plan to help create a stunning masterpiece. Distanced learning does not offer these kinds of beneficial components that puclic or private schools have.

Finally, distanced learning may be very convenient but also comes with a lot of distractions that are bound to do the worst for any academic student. Waking up at the break of dawn, stressing over which outift to wear, or not eating breakfast tend to mess with the mind of a student leading to negative thougths about school. But these problems all start with the student. Having expierences like these will cause distractions for when taking distanced learning classes. When at home, a student may take advantage of not having a class start time and will sleep in which becomes a bad habit and tends to make one lazier. Also, when at home, there is no teacher of professor that will set restrictions to keep a student from going off track or not completing work. Being surrounded by electronics, food, and even a bed can have tempting effects on a student learning from their bedroom. That is the perfect disaster for any student at home. All kids love to sleep, eat, and play games or even watch TV. Every public and private school will avoid obstacles that mess with a students learning. That is why distanced learning is not as benficial as attending school physically.

Although students may enjoy the fresh air of their house and prefer learning there, public and private schools can keep students focused and better the mental minds and health of these pupils. The rise of online education may be a factor in students becoming lazy and weak minded. The old pencil and paper method in a classroom is the most effective way in creating bright leaders for what our future brings.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

0FDA6AC79713,"I bet that if you went around a public school asking kids where they would rather be doing school online or in a school, I bet that the majority of the kids would say they would much rather be doing school like they're now. Why is this, well being a teenager is probably one of the greatest things that can ever happen in your life, we can definitely agree that some of the people that we meet in high school are going to be our friends for a long time and that can sometimes benefit us in the long run, and really the only benefit of being at home for your classes would be being in the comfort of your own home.

Going to school in the morning is probably the worst thing in the world, because I know that when I wake up in the morning I tell myself that I really do not want to go to school, but later on in the day when I wake up it isn't so bad at all. Really I just sit in a classroom and listen to a teacher lecture for an hour and thirty minutes, the only thing that really sucks is how late that we get out because by the time that we get out it's pretty much already dinner time and we still need to do our homework. So being at home throughout your school day would be awesome but you really have the think about the long run, when you grow up you're going to have a job where you work with people, and if you cannot do that then you might get fired. Some more things that can benefit you at a public school could be a library, councilor, and teachers. You don't have an open library when you're home schooled or you don't have school councilors to help you if you have any questions and the real life interaction that you get with your teachers is so much better than having a teacher try to explain you something through a screen. Pretty much the only thing that I would change about my public school is how late we get in and how late we get out, all of the other schools around us get to school around 7:30am and get out around 2:45pm and that would be great because we would be be to get so much more done like homework and projects that you waited last minute for. Getting home at 4:30 in the afternoon sucks I get home and eat dinner right away pretty much and by the time that i'm done with dinner I have to go to practice and that ends at 9:30 don't get home till about 10:30 then that leaves no time for homework.

So in conclusion going to school at a public or private school would be much better than being home schooled, there are just so many more reasons to be going to a public school than being home schooled it's cheaper it has way more things that can support you like friends, and teachers. So I bet that if you still went around asking students where they would of rather been doing school most of them would still say a public school. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

8BD27AA126F7,"Imagine you're being asked to do a task wit a group and you fail it based on the fact that you do not know how to work with other people. This scenario will happen a lot in colleges or jobs because you don't have the experience of working with other people. What I'm covering today is the fact that students shouldn't take school from home. Although there will be a lot less distractions, students should not attend classes from home because you get experience working with other people, if you mess up on something, you won't have someone telling you what you did wrong, and you have people there to help you to get where you want to get in life.

My first point is you don't get enough experience being home alone and doing your work. Schools are supposed to help you decide what you want to do after school and most jobs require most people to work wit other people. Like the army, navy or even a grocery store.

These jobs all have one job in common. You have to work with people to get the job done. Another problem may be that in some work places they need specific things as in references and in some colleges, they need references too. So you if your at home, you won't be able to get those references if you can get any at all.

Secondly, if you only take classes at home, you don't have someone telling you what you did wrong. If you're at school and you get something wrong on a work sheet, the teacher can tell you how you got something wrong and let you know so you don't make the same mistake again. And if you get it wrong by yourself, you won't really know how to get it right the next time. In addition, they say that it's also better in a classroom because the teacher wants you to succeed.

My last point is you want to have people who want to see you to do well and can't wait to see you to do something great with your life. Just sitting in front of a computer, the computer is not going to say, hey that's a good job. But sitting in a classroom with peers and teachers who actually care, will help you get to where you want to be. And another positive thing is you get more knowledge when you're about to go to college also it's easier to learn is in the classroom.

In conclusion, students shouldn't only be able to take classes at home because you will get experience working with other people. If you do something wrong, you won't have anyone to tell you it's wrong and you have people who will help you to where you want to be in life. To sum it all up, taking classes from home is an insufficient way of learning. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
9E8BA894C495,"A student is late for class because there was an accident on her street. She would have been on time if she took the class online. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes online in their homes. Online courses would benefit students because they are less likely to be late or miss classes, they will have more free time and take more classes, and because students with physical disabilities wouldn't have to try and navigate the halls and campus of the school.

Students are more likely to be on time to classes if they take them online. Everyone has their own life and sometimes they can't help it if they are late to class. They could be driving on the road to get to class when suddenly, they hit traffic and miss the class entirely. If they take the class online they don't have to worry about the travel time. They just need to worry about having a Wifi connection and a device that they can attend the online class with. In the time it takes a student to drive to their class they could have taken another class.

Moreover, Students are more likely to attend more classes if they take them online. If students take online courses they can take classes one right after the other. Now, the students have more time in their schedule. As a result, they can take their classes in a shorter time frame, and have more time to take other classes. Say for example a person normally takes Math, Science, History, and English classes in a day. If he takes them online he can also fit in a music class.

The main and most prominent reason to have an online option is to help the physically disabled. Most often college, high schools, and middle schools are not fully equipped with the necessary tools to help people with their disabilities. There aren't as many ramps as there are stairs in most schools. It would help so many people who are in the hospital with illnesses and injuries still be able to learn. Sometimes people can be in the hospital for months at a time and there is a lot of valuable information that they are missing. It would help tremendously if people with disabilities could still be able to learn and not have to go through the trouble of having to get to school.

Although, some people may say it would make students more lazy, it would most likely have the opposite affect. One of the main reasons people hate going to school is because they have to leave their comfortable bed. With online classes they don't have to get out. Online Courses would benefit students by helping them show up on time to their classes, help them have a way to take more classes, and it would help the students with physical disabilities have an easier time getting their education.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1A1F158C0D82,"Distance learning, also known as home bound or other various names, would be beneficial for a select group of students. While it might not be a positive experience for every child, it should be offered for the individuals that are interested or for whom it is needed.

Distance learning would be beneficial for students who have chronic illnesses. If these students were enrolled in a traditional school, they would most likely have poor attendance due to their health issues. This poor attendance would lead to many missed lessons and extra assignments that the student would be responsible for. Students with chronic illnesses have busy and stressful lives aside from their schoolwork. Distance learning would allow these students to receive their education in a more flexible way. This would also allow teachers to save time by not needing to bring a student up to speed on what is currently being taught in the classroom. If these students were allowed to attend and participate in online video conferences, they would be able to maintain a connection with their fellow students. This could help engage certain students who otherwise feel disconnected with their peers. Their education would also not be delayed due to them missing school.

Another group who would benefit from the option of distance learning is students who have extremely busy schedules outside of school. Many students in our current generation are stressed and overworked due to attempting to balance school, sports, jobs, and other extra curricular activities. Distance learning would be a beneficial option for these students because it would allow them more time to split between these activities. This option would suit these students' demanding schedules. If these students were given the option of distance learning they would be able to work school into their schedule where they see fit. Attending school in a brick building from 9 a. m. to 4 p. m. simply does not work with certain people's personal schedules. Again, it is education presented in a more flexible way, rather than traditional learning.

There are many students who suffer from ADHD, ADD, and other attention disorders. Certain students of this group would benefit from the option of distance learning. This does not apply to every student with attention disorders, however, for some, it is extremely difficult for them to focus in a traditional learning environment. Distance learning would give these students an option that would allow them to pay attention to what is being taught. These students education's could be hindered due to these disorders if they are not placed in an environment where they can thrive.

A large number of high school students today suffer from mental health issues. The most common of these being anxiety and depression. The root of these disorders vary, however, many students do not find it positive to be enrolled in a traditional learning environment. For some of these students the root of their issue is school itself or the environment they are in during the school day. Due to bullies, issues with teachers, or other reasons, some students benefit from the alternative of learning outside of school. Presenting distance learning brings forward an option that will allow them the time and space needed to better themselves.

There is a large number of students that would benefit from the option of distance learning. Students with chronic illnesses, busy schedules, attention disorders, and mental health disorders are only a few of the many. Select students simply do not do well in a traditional learning environment. If presented with the option of distance learning, these students would possibly be given an option where they can thrive in an individualized learning environment. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
AE359CF88362,"Most students have, at one point or another in their time in school, likely wished they were homeschooled. However, it may not have been possible for that to happen due to family issues, work times, or financial limitations. But now, some schools offer ""distance learning""--a way for students to get the same instruction from their own home. This could be extremely beneficial in allowing students with certain problems to obtain the same education as others.

If, for instance, a student has some sort of social anxiety or stress-related medical condition, being able to attend classes from home would make it much less likely that they would have some sort of episode. They would still be getting the same or similar education as their peers without the stress of leaving home. Or, for a wider audience, if a student falls ill, they need not miss a day of education, instead still being able to recieve instruction without the fear of spreading sickness to others. Both of these instances are fairly specific, but still can show how ""distance learning"" can help students more than regular class time. This type of teaching could also be beneficial to the parents of students; if a perent wanted for their child to be homeschooled but didn't have the time or finances to allow that full-time, the online councilling would make homeschooling much simpler and potentially cheaper. Or if a parent has no way to transport their child to and from school, for instance if they live too far away for a walk to be reasonable but aren't close to a bus route and the parent or parents must leave for work early in the morning, the online learning cuts out the need for travel and transportation.

However, there is the issue of distraction. Surely a student left to learn at home with no teacher physically present is more likely to be distracted! But scool can be equally distracting for some students, and perhaps the more streamlined and simplified teaching style would benefit students with short attention spans or conditions like attention deficit disorder. One never really knows until the time comes.

When it comes to online ""distance learning"", the pros seem to outweigh the cons. Students who have medical conditions or who have temporarily fallen ill can continue to learn the same material as their peers and classmates without the probelems that their condition might cause them or others. Parents who wish to have their child homeschoolecd could do so without nearly so big a financial or time investment. And if a student needs a slightly slower or slightly faster pace of learning, they could receive that, as there could be many ""distance classes"" with varying paces or types of learninf for students who learn different things different ways at different speeds. On the whole, in this era of technology and ease, it seems that it should be very simple for students to receive the instruction they need in whatever way they absorb it best, and if their learning requires or is bettered by them remaining in their home and receiving instruction from afar, then it seems like that would be simple enough to achieve.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B7075CD10BCC,"In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody. We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime

Many student don't like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I don't think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they don't pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life.

Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you.

For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe

This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience.

In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more. Study is more important, the place is not important beacuse when the person want to be someone like a professional in the future they need study much.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4

You won't be able to go to the school games and cheer for your school you won't have fun like the student's that are in school.

Student's that take an online class I can call them smarter than me. I feel like if you take an online class you have a greater chance of pasting to the next grade than me. I have an good and bad response to online classes. In an online class you have no consequences like student's in school have. Online classes is unique because you do what you want when you want.

In conclusion if your online or in school your still learning and that's all that matter. Online and video conferencing and school are all the same your just learning in a difference manner. Some say that you can learn faster in an online class and some say difference. People say that online class are for college student's than grade school students. The only thing I can say is that you do what's good for you.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
FF1FAA91122E,"Benefits of Distant Learning for Students

Imagine going to a school for a class that's far distanced away from home, then you get a call from back home informing you that there's an emergency. How would that make you feel being in a completely different state to take a class when there's a family emergency back at home? All students have responsibilities outside of receiving their education. Some students also must pay large amounts of money to receive the education they need. Some people may say, education is the most significant aspect of a student's life. However, there are more important aspects to consider in a student's life, such as taking care of your family and other responsibilities, or being mindful of the cost it takes to get the education needed.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home by the satisfaction that they won't become homesick. Some college students tend to be homesick after leaving there family to go to school far away from home. This issue can result in depression and the inability to complete their schoolwork successfully. The reason for benefits of being able to attend classes from home would be for students to not become homesick, leading to failure in their studies. Some people may say students can always go back home to visit family, or use the FaceTime app to see them. Clearly, that would be an option for a student to use as far as seeing their family, but it's not the same as being able to have a real connection and presence of your family everyday. Students also have other responsibilities to take care of at home, such as family emergencies. For example, this year of 2020, the corona virus has been quickly spreading worldwide, affecting many citizens of the US and other countries. The sickness could reach a student's family member, resulting in the student having the responsibility to take care of the rest of the family during their time of crisis. Any other responsibilities to be mindful of at home are significant in students lives that require the limitation of traveling far distances. With the opportunity for students to attend classes from home by using online sources, or video conferencing will eliminate homesickness and increase the ability to take care of responsibilities at home. Some people may say that students have to make sacrifices for their education. However, why would students run the extra mile of receiving their education, when it can be easily be obtained in another way.

Another benefit from being able to attend classes from home would be schools willing to occupancy the students needs. Most of the time, when traveling far distances away from home, it can be expensive and the price of being in a new housing is difficult for students to pay. Every student receiving an education may not be wealthy enough or have the financial stability to move far distances from home. Attending classes with distance learning by utilizing online or video conferencing can be beneficial, so that student doesn't have to pay large amounts of money. For example, imagine a student having the opportunity to attend classes in another state but the rent for housing in that state is expensive. It would be beneficial for the the school who has given them the opportunity to take classes there to offer distance learning. The reason for schools being able to offer distance learning is beneficial is because the school should be willing to occupancy all students needs. For example, I attend a school that's not within my zone school due to being a participant of the International Baccularete Program. Before joining the program, they guaranteed transportation needs if I couldn't provide my own transportation. I ride the hub bus every morning to get to school on time. Since the program was willing to occupancy my needs in receiving my education, all schools and programs must do the same. Some people may say it's the students responsibility to take care of their own educational needs. Clearly, they are wrong because educational organizations must support the needs of every student despite the amount of how much help they need.

Some people may say schools offering distance learning for students to attend classes by using online or video conferencing isn't beneficial. However, they are wrong because there are many benefits using that option, such as decreasing homesickness, taking care of family and responsibilities at home, limiting expensive needs, and schools willing to support their students. These benefits can reassure a student receiving a successful, comfortable, and significant education. Clearly, there's a large amount of things to consider in a students life when they are receiving an education and it's important for the student and the school to have a working system regarding needs and aspects of that student's life. Students benefiting from being able to attend classes from home can result in success for students education. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
86245BB1A314,"Does one truly need a classroom to learn about the world around them? For the last few decades, one couldn't imagine school life without thinking of the classrooms they spent hours in everyday. Turning every year into a busy pattern of learning as more and more children are placed into the school system. At one point in time, this wouldn't have been an issue. But now, as the student body at school grows larger, teachers lack the time to focus on every student. Causing students who are going through medical issues or needing extra help falling through the cracks. This leaves the question, how do we support the students who need extra help outside the classroom? Through online, long distance learning, students gain the ability to learn from home. Online classes leads to strong benefits because it helps injured students continue their studies, supporting those who need extra help, and showing them how to manage their time.

When a student is injured, catching up on what they missed in school can be more stressful the injury itself at the time. Many students being forced to restart the full semester for something out of their control. Wasting the time they already placed into the class. However, with online schooling, students are able to work from home. Giving them a chance to catch up without needing someone to give them every worksheet the teacher might have given out. With this, once the student returns to class, they should have limited issues with the new topics being taught in class.

As the amount of students slowly grow, teachers have to limit the one on one focus they give to each student, but with online learning can get the extra help they need. During class, many teachers don't have the time to help a student if the rest of the class is ready to continue. Students giving up trying to learn the subject at all. This is where online schooling would come in. Outside of class, through video conferencing, a teacher can get a chance to fully go over any questions the student may have. Even tests are possible in this method. The teacher being able to watch the student complete the questions while correcting them on the way. All of this leading to better students and better grades over time.

Some people may argue that, without a teacher, students would not complete their work. Possibly allowing themselves to fail in favor of playing a video game or sleeping. Without outside control, it is easy to understand why one would think that. However, just because school is online doesn't mean there aren't punishments. Not only should a student's guardian be able to keep the student from slacking off, but teachers as well. Just because the schooling would be online it doesn't mean the student can't be punished. Time management is a very important thing for everyone to learn and online school is a great way to teach it. Forcing a student to understand if they don't plan, they will face the repercussions.

With students having the ability to work from home injured students and those who need extra help are able to continue their studies while also learning to manage their time. For those injured, online schooling gives them the chance to keep up with their studies while they are healing. For students needing extra help, teachers could video conference from home, allowing the student to ask questions they need to. And, even if students aren't observed as much at home, that doesn't change the fact the student with face punishments for slacking off for no reason. In conclusion, I believe online learning is something both students and teachers need. For the sake of our schools and the sake of our future.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
20E2A9554CFD,"School is a stressful place for teens nowadays. Having to look good, having the best hair, keeping up with friends, or just trying not to start trouble. With these things always plaguing the back of their minds students can hardly stay on task or get to work. But with modern technology there are now more options; using the internet online learning is possible just from staying at your own home. Doing this will reduce students being stressed out from being at school and help keep them focused. Having the option to take classes from home using online or video conferencing will be beneficial for students.

Teens always stress over the littlest of things, so if they were at a place where they are most comfortable it would help them stay calm. Most distractions in the classrooms come from students worrying about themselves wondering what the other students think about them. This takes away from their focus and keeps them occupied in their mind about something completely irrelevant and not about the class. Allowing them to stay at home and take classes from there, they don't need to worry about that since their is nobody to judge them.

Online classes have more usage than just getting rid of classroom distractions. It also provides a way for students to still be learning with issues in getting to school. Missing class is damaging to students learning and because unforeseen events can happen at random times, these problems are unavoidable. It could be weather, sickness, a problem within the school, or there being traffic delaying school buses and parents dropping off kids. With the usage of online classes however, it would help keep students learning even if their is a problem outside of their control.

Now, some people may say that because students are at home they can still get distracted from other things around them. This is a good point however, the benefits still out weigh the negatives. Students will always be distracted by something but being at home all they need to focus on is their work and not their peers around them. Mainly phones are a huge problem but with the help of parents or guardians they can keep their child away from distractions when it's time to work. Now that they are away from all of those problems they can completely stay on task with their work and complete it proficiently

Regular school should still be an option but allowing students to have the choice to choose online classes will help those who believe it would help them more. Even students who believed that simply going to school would help them more could still find benefits from using online classes. With the use of modern technology and the help of schools, online classes could just be the future of learning.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
8A142C377525,"School offer a lot when it comes to learning and now they are offering more than ever with distance learning. Distance learning is a good thing for students because they can finish a class without ever leaving their home. Yes some people make the argument that its a bad thing because the student isnt with the teacher and can't ask questions. Well students and teachers both have emails that they can ask question and answer the questions the student has.

With online classes and virtual school students wont have to wake up at the crack of dawn anymore to get to school. With students being able to sleep the amount their bodies need they will learn better and not falling asleep in the middle of a lesson. Kid's sleeping has always been a thorn in the side of schools backs due to the fact that the student will miss whats being taught to them. Now that online classes are coming more popular kids will be able to stay awake throughout the entire lesson.

Kid's get taken out of the school day all the time for no reason and miss whats going on for the rest of that day. When a student gets sick they miss a couple of days and have no idea whats going on when they get back. Student's don't have to miss a single day of class with virtual school. They are already home and can just log onto their computer and see what they have to do for the class today.

Distance learning is a great thing it's going to help many student's graduate high school and accomplish their dreams in life.

40F5F0642A89,"School is something that everyone has to go through. Whether you go to public school or private school I am sure that everyone has wondered what it would be like to be homeschooled. Recently, schools have started offering distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online or video conferencing. Distance learning gives students a way out of having to sit in classroooms all day, and gives teachers a bit of leway with the methods in which they teach. I believe that students would benefit from attending classes from home, because students could work at their own pace, students could learn in their own way, and students could attain more information through distance learning.

Firstly, students could work at their own pace through online learning. In normal classrooms if one person does not understand the material, then the entire class has to go back to the beginning and learn it all over again. This constant backtracking makes it hard for students to retain the information, and makes it difficult for the teachers to teach the material effectively. If students were to work from home, then they could work as fast or slow as they wanted to. This would also teach them to learn information faster, because of the deadlines. The same group of students in a classroom would do better on exams though distance learning, because they could learn at their speed without worry of having to go back.

Second, students could learn in their own ways through online learning. Different people have different ways of learning a topic. One could need a visual aid while another needs to hear it repeated multiple times. The teachers have no way to cater to the learning styles of the students, becuase of the short class periods and the short semesters. If Students were to have the ability to do their work online, then it would take the stress off of both the students and teachers. All the teachers would have to do is give the stidents the information and it would be the students responsibility to retain the information in their own way.

Finally, students could attain more information through online learning. I have been taking online classes for 4 years, and I can truthfully say that i have learned more in the online classes than I do in regular classes. In online classes students can spend all the time they need retaining that the information the teacher provided. They can also relax a bit, and that definitly helps open their mind. When exam time comes, the students can spend their class period reviewing notes for that class, which not only helps them pass their exams, but also gives them an inportant life skill, time management.

In conclusion, schools should offer more online classes and distnace learning to their students. Online learning gives students many life skills needed, such as responsibility and time management. Some may say that online learning hurts students, because of the amount of screen time necessary. However, students spend the same amount of screen time at school that they would with online learning. I think that students would benefit greatly from attending classes from home, because students could work at their own pace, students could learn in their own way, and students could attain more information through distance learning. Online learning is the future. Please give our students a chance at an education tailored to them.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
60D5DEB40F45,"Distance learining is an option students have now that allows them to attend class from home by way of online or video confrencing. Distance learning has been getting more popular as the years go by for high school students. There has been controversy though, on whether or not students will benefit through attending class via online at home. Reasons such as not being able to be one on one with the teacher, cheating, and not staying on task are why students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home.

The first reason why students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home is not having the opportunity to be one on one with your teacher. In a normal classroom teachers are there to help and support the students. Students are able to get their specific questions answered by teachers and are also able to stay after school to get more help or study with teachers. By attending class at home students are not able to ask teacher specific questions that they would be able to if they went to a normal school. Students also loose the opportunity of staying after school for any help from teachers or any extra curricular activities. By attending class online students loose so many opportunities that they would have had with teachers if they went to school.

The next reason on why students will not benefit from being able to take classes at home is the amount of cheating that will happen if they did. Cheating is already a major problem most schools face and distance learning won't help stop cheating at all. Distance learning gives studnets the chance to cheat by using any other resources they have while, for example taking a test. The disadvantage to this is that teachers or administrators would not be able to do anything about it becausse they won't be there to see it or stop it. There would be no way of stoping students from cheating while taking a test or a quiz because no one will be able to supervise them. Also distance learning will increase the amount of school work shared online. Students may think that by getting a good grade by cheating will benefit them but in the long run it will not. When cheating students will tend to rely on it and will not be able to learn the material.

The final reason on why students will not benefit from being able to attend class from home is the distractions. At school there are almost zero distractions other than other students. But in distance learning it's almost the complete opposite. In a classroom students are not able to use their phones and talk to other students when they are learing which tends to make the student focus more on the curriculam. At home studnets are not be watched over which tends to make the student get off task. When students or not on task they eventually start falling behind which is likely to occur when being able to class online. Distance learning is not beneficial to student compared to learning at school because it ussually associates to the student not on task.

Some people may say that distance learing is beneficial to the student becuase it allows them to learn on their on pace at home, but there are many cons then pros with distance learning. Reasons such as not being able to see the teacher one on one, higher amount of cheating, and not being able to stay on task prove that there are more negatives that comes with distance learning than positives. Overall as more and more high school students choose to take distance learining the better and more beneficial option is to learn at school.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

160C8B8C0E64,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home at all. Taking video conference classes can be hard; the WiFi going out, hard to see what the teacher is writing, and hard to hear what the teacher is saying. The students attending video conferencing classes will possibly struggle to learn and pass the classes. Some students will find it hard to focus and end up doing something other then paying attention to the class.

Students taking online classes will think they have as much time to do an assignment, so they can go do what ever they want to do. Then the students will forgot about their online classes and end up failing their classes. Some students will start to think there is no point anymore to take the classes and end up dropping the classes. When they drop their classes they will have a hard time finding a good job for their future, no company wants to hire a drop out because it wouldn't do the company any good; the company would think the drop out is just going to quit and affect the company future. So the drop out will struggle his whole life looking for a job and being able to live.

When taking an online class you have to be on top of it all the time, but some students will slack off and later on they would wonder why they're failing the classes. It's really hard to bring the grades up when you're failing them. Some students will care about their grades and start trying their hardest to bring them up. The students that will not try to bring their grades up and end up taking the classes again or end up dropping out. So you have to make a hard decision but good, because it will affect you're future.

I conclude attending online classes or video conferencing is not a smart move to take. Going to public or private schools are the decisions to make. It will help with social skills, getting involved in the school activities, the teachers can see what is good for you, and what is the best decision for you to take. It also can help on job interviews knowing you attend to school. Having a good education will help out a lot. It can get you into a good college and get you into a good job with a really good pay for your future. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
62FC97D29846,"Would students benefit from taking online classes from home?

Modern technology has made tremendous leaps of growth in the past two decades, regarding accessibility to class work and instruction over the Internet. Within school systems, controversy has emerged over whether students would benefit from being able to attend school from home, through an online program or video-conference calls. Although some view online classes as a source of increased procrastination and growth of anti-social tendencies, online classes would effectively help students to reduce stress, allow them to also prioritize hobbies and passions, as well as compel the students to develop skills and traits to succeed.

Ability for students to take online courses would firstly, help students reduce their stress and academic burdens. High school students must wake up quite early in the morning (typically before dawn), prepare for school, and drive through several minutes of traffic to arrive early: just to sit in various classrooms for ninety minutes at a time, completing classwork and receiving additional homework. How much more convenient it would be for some students to wake up whenever their body indicates it is adequately rested, get a healthy meal for breakfast, and work at their own pace in the comfort of their home. Such a relaxed schedule would be beneficial, especially for senior students in high school. Throughout the year, their minds are focused on completing college applications, applying for financial aid, sending in SAT scores and college transcripts. Taking online courses from home would allow those students to attend to their other responsibilities and manage classwork at their own convenience. In addition, some students, unfortunately, get bullied in school by their classmates. Studying at home would allow victims of bullying to be in their safe haven, away from those who oppress them and ridicule them for being different. Often times, high school students worry that colleges would view their decision to take online classes as lazy or careless, however, I have heard that colleges value how challenging the class is, the effort put in, and how well-rounded the student is. Furthermore, enrolling in online courses would improve the mental and physical health of students.

Additionally, students would benefit form being able to attend school classes from home because it allows them to also prioritize their hobbies, passions and fulfill duties for the family. In the novel,

Educated, by Tara Westover, Tara's family did not allow her to go to public schools that were endorsed by the government. Instead, Tara was home schooled, inconsistently, by her mother, through her middle school years; but she primarily worked with her brothers and father in a junkyard. Westover and her family lived a simple, somewhat poor lifestyle in the mountains of Utah. Some families suffer from the same burdens and need their children to work on the farm or in the shop with them. Rather than quitting school altogether, the children could take online courses to receive the education required to build a better life for themselves, while at the same time, helping their family.

In the same way, not only would online courses allow students to fulfill duties to the family, such as working, students can also prioritize their hobbies and ambitions;. For example, in this generation, common teenagers gain fame and fortune from becoming social media influencers. This requires them to travel for meet and greets with fans, have tours, always take pictures, make videos and advertise products. Additionally, some athletes are apart of extremely competitive travel teams that require them to travel often for tournaments and competitions. Such extracurricular activities should not be given up because it interferes with school. Those activities are the passions and hobbies of some individuals and online schooling would allow them to get their education and participate in events they love.

Lastly, online schooling would compel students to develop valuable traits and skills. Taking online courses is different from physically going into school buildings because in the buildings, students sit at a desk and are instructed by a teacher, versus, online classes require communication via email or conference call. As a result of this, online students must develop initiative and independence. They cannot rely on constant reminders from teaches and classmates about when assignments are due, additionally, because they have the freedom to complete assignments at any time prior to the due date, they must have time management skills so not all tasks are left undone until the last minute. The students must also acquire mental and emotional strength, as they will always be studying alone in their homes without the comfort of their peers. When the students learn to acquire these traits, success in their online courses and beyond would be inevitable.

In conclusion, there are many benefits from being able to attend school classes from home through online school or video conference calls. Some examples include: reduced stress, ability to fulfill other responsibilities and prioritize hobbies, and finally, develop valuable skills that will assist with success in the online course and life after high school. Generic_School is very aware of the damage some students suffered from because they were compelled to attend school away from home, so they instituted the Hybrid Program and Virtual Generic_School, which allows the students to take either all their classes from the comfort of their home, or just a few so they take a few courses in the building and others at home. This gives the students the power to control their schedules and make their high school experience and academic load less stressful.           ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
7F539C089AFF,"With technology being used more in society, websites like Khan Academy and IXL are being used increasingly more than before. To adapt to these changes, schools have started to offer distance learning which allows students to take classes from the comfort of their homes. If students were to take distance learning courses, they will benefit and learn more effectively from these courses.

Firstly, the student will feel comfortable learning at home. To elaborate, the student taking the classes will be able to learn at their own pace and feel relaxed. For example, my precalc class has a lot of topics to cover over the span of 9 months. In order to teach everything in the curriculum in a class that lasts for 90 minutes, my teacher often spends a week to two weeks on a given topic, giving me, the student, little time to digest all the new information I received. If I were to take the same class but online class at home, I would be able to take my time to truly learn and understand each concept. The location of the class can also impact ones learning ability. For example, my World History 2 class had many students that took the class to be with their friends. Every other day, the group of friends that sat in the back of the class would always take over the teacher, resulting in me not being able to hear the lesson. To combat this, I would go home at the end of the day and watch a video explaining the lesson I was supposed to learn that day. At the end of the school year, I learned that it is beneficial to have a quiet place to study and what better place to study than at home.

Secondly, distance learning courses will help the student save money on class materials. For example, my English class required me to buy many items: two notebooks, a three-inch D-ring binder, a folder, black pens, and pencils. The cost of these items totaled a little more than $50. That was the price of the materials for just one of my seven classes. For a distance learning course, the most a student will spend, given they already own a computer, is $10 for paper and pencils to do work with. The student doesn't need to buy folders or binders for online classes because all of the documents will be online. The student can also revisit the documents at a later date for an online class, unlike the papers in a binder which can be lost or worn down over time. The money the student saves from not having to buy class materials can be put into paying for college.

Skeptics will say that distance learning courses deprive kids and teens of their needed interaction time with others. While the student may not be able to interact with their fellow companions during school hours, they will still have plenty of time after school. The role of a student is not to only enjoy their time with friends but to study for the future. Interactions with friends are important for students so they do not burn themselves out after studying for hours. I do not see my friends all day during school, but I always find time to relax, have conversations, and study with friends when school ends.

To summarize, while being comfortable for the student, distance learning courses offer all the same benefits as classes in schools. Given the opportunity, I would replace some of my classes with classes I can take online in the comfort of my home. The cost of the online classes can also help you in the future because you'll be saving money on class materials.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DB52CF86239E,"I believe that students would benefit from distance learning. This is due to the fact the many students find home a more safe and comfortable environment. With students studying and learning in a more friendly environment they would be able to focus more on what their learning instead of worrying about what other students think of them. This would result in higher grades and higher academic goals. Not only would this benefit the student, but it would also benefit schools. Online classes would make no need for a physical classroom resulting in less need for a school building. Then, if they were to have homework that is done on the computer like most schools already practice, this would save on paper usage and reduce the impact on the environment.

The largest downside to distance learning however is the funding for this massive move to virtual classes and learning. I don't see this as an issue in America or other developed countries. But in third-world countries such as countries in Africa and Asia would not have the proper funding to convert. Education is aleady such a scarce thing in those countries and making it even more expensive to obtain would make it even more difficult. Not only would the school system have to buy computers for the students but internet is another large cost. No internet would make the online classes totally useless if students weren't able to access them. But in countries where the cost isn't an issue and internet coverage is great, the only real downside at that point would be distractions in the students household. With students being within walking distance of their personal belongings they could get easily sidetracked or lose focus with another activity. An example of this would be a student playing a video game on their game console instead of focusing on their school subject or a student watching their favorite show could make the student focus more on the show instead of the course they are taking. Family members and pets are another distractions you have to keep in mind. Another issue with online classes are that there are some classes you can't actually take online. Such as band and orchestra and many others. For these classes you have to physically be there in person to achieve.

In all, I believe in my general area online classes would be beneficial to many but I enjoy coming to a physical classroom and experiencing a more hands on learning. Meeting new people or meeting up with friends after school is another large plus to coming to school.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
CDAE662C4C8F,"Students have the option taking classes from home by online or video conferencing because if they have two classes only to graduate is better to take them online so they don't have to go to school. It's a good idea of learning how to take online classes. After,they are done with there classes they can go apply to college or get a job to work in. they need to have the requirements that they need to apply to college. The support of this idea is that you don't have to get up so early to get ready and go to school. The benefit of students is to getting up early and not going to school they could get on their computer at the time they have their classes. For the students it would benefit because they are not moving from one class to another they stay in one place and listening to the classes on the computer. The reason why i'm agreeing is because they can be more focused at home on the computer with the class because other people aren't distracting others from listening to the teachers they are focused in the class. The benefit of students taking classes at home is because they don't have to wake up so early and they can have their lunch when the class is over. Examples of online classes is to not wake up early and be on the computer, when your class is going to start. They can do other things, while they are waiting for their class to start and be at the computer when is starting. They don't have to be in a rush that they are late to school.

The students don't have to wake up so early to get dressed and other things for school ,while they have online classes. It's a better way of learning how to do online classes. They don't have to worry about waking up so early for their classes and sitting in every class for an hour that all day in school. They can wake up but not so early lie to go to school they can wake up like at seven or eight o'clock in the morning do what the have to do,then stop at the time they have their class. If they are doing laundry , folding clothes , washing dishes or cleaning before they have their class that's a good idea. While they get home from school and do homework they don't do what their parents told them to do then they will get in trouble why they didn't do it. That's why their is a good example why online classes is a benefit for students they can do what they have to do at home, while they have their class.

Another reason, is that they don't have to be late for school while they drive to school get a pass and go to class. That could be a waste of time and only coming for two or three classes, while they could save time at home and do other things and just get on the computer at the time that class starts. The school doesn't have to call your parents if they are late to class or absent while you are online taking the class and listening to the class. Being late to school is not a good thing because you can miss work,then you have to make it up and turn it in when it's due. Some teachers give an extended class period to turn in their work the next class period so they can get it done and turned in. They should be on time for their classes so they don't have to miss work and just get done in class the same day. If they come in late they still have to do makeup work for the class that they missed. They have to tell the teacher when they see her again that they missed what they did in class so the teacher knows what they missed. If you don't tell a teacher what you missed during that class the teacher won't know what u missed and the teacher can put a zero on work u have not done or not turned in on time.

Another example, is the teachers handing out a lot of papers that they have to do all those papers in the class period. Sometimes they give us four to five papers and tell us to finish it by the end of the class period. The good thing that for online classes or video conferencing u don't have to get papers. If they tell u to do a document or presentation it's on the computer so u dont have papers to do it with. Students have issues losing papers that are every important when they are going to be having a test or something and the teacher tells them to turn it in that is going to be a grade or going to take it for a grade while taking the test. While online classes or video conferencing they tell you what you are suppose to do, but their work they do it online they don't need papers so they can do the work if its a document or presentation the teacher just tells them the instructions what has to be on the presentation or document what is going to be graded on. For online or video conferencing classes they really need to pay attention to the class what activities they are going to do and what is going to be a grade or not be a grade on some documents or reading passages depends on the class they are taking online. Some teachers say right away when they hand papers our or tell them what to do they say what is a grade and what is not a grade.

In conclusion, I agree to the prompt because their could be some students that don't want to school only for two or three classes and have the option to take classes online or video conferencing but they don't have to wake up early so they could get ready for school and that they will be late while they get a pass and go to class while they already have missed half of the class. They need to tell the teacher that they need the missing work that they missed so they can get caught up with the work and the class. But it's better online or video conferencing because they don't have to turn in papers to the teacher. They can do it online and submit it where the teacher tells them to submit the work in so she can grade it. The students can learn more about how to use the computer and learn hoe online or video conferencing classes work online. Some students can be more focused at home than school because they can concentrate by themselves and do there work and then turn it in when done to the teacher online.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
2D0CDBC81DC0,"Some schools have the option for students to complete or inish their classes from home, I agree that students would benefit from being able to take their classes in home.

Mosts schools have the option of take their classes in home. They have many ways to do it, some of this onlines schools have online classes is most commun option, this onlines classes can be benifit for the students because they can finish their classes earlier than normal high school student in regular classes, it make more time for the students to do any other activite as sport, read, or spend time for their self. Schools have two kind of online classes, private and group classes. Private classes can help the student to have more comprehend and attetion because is the only student in the class that make a better connection with the teacher, the teacher can have more focus on the student. Private classes can be best option for shy students, they can feel comfortable to share their ideas and comments with out others students pressure. Home schools also have a groups classes this kind a classes are made for more than one students in the class, group classes are as the regular class in regulars schools. There are many students and just one teachers. The only difference is that students recived their class online and it almost imposible to miss a day by online classes because you can make your schelude and in some online group classes you can select your teacher, it just depend if the schools let you select the teachers.

Some of this schools also use video conferencing, vidio conferencing is great because students can have a better communication with the teacher and the rest of the class, i think vidio conferencing work as a regular class, seen everyone. The benefit for this option is that you can perceive the imagine that is easy for your brain to understand things and is also better to have most understanding about the topic that you recive in class. Students can change their ideas and thougths each others to have a better reflection of the class, they can help each other if they don't understand something. Teachers also make they classes more interesting by making diferent dynamics to don't make the class bored. Homeworks by video conferencing i think is better than regulars schools homeworks because if they have time at the end of the class, they complete their homework each other, if they have any question teachers and students share they anwers, it make easy for the students to complete the homeworks.

Many students can't attend regular school for many reason. This students can have disease, for that reason they prefer to be in home and many cases their doctor tell them to be in home with special supervision. Some others students their parents parents have a specials jobs, their jobs make them travel a lot, they move to other country or state for months or couple years so this students finish or do schools by distance learning. Students who were victim of bulling also prefer to finish their year in home. There are many reason why people can't go to regulars or prefer to do online schools. For this different cases and there are many others cases why people don't attend regulars schools, the best option for them is distance learning they going to have the same learn as a regulars schools.

In conclusion, many people get benefit to do distance learning also call online school. People have many reason why they attend this onlines schools, the benefit that they have is really big they can finish or do their school in really big distance from other country or any other place, they also have different option to complete their classes as groups classes, private classes and vidio conferencing, they can also choise they teacher and schelude. This onlines can be the best option and can benefit everyone.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
049E10369FBA,"Over the years, the ways of attending school have gradually advanced. Being present to class can now mean through an electronic screen, phone calls, and even of course actually going to school. It has even become more of an advantage to those whose parents aren't comfortable with their child containing special needs to attend public school, and accessible to those who are physically disabled. Some may think otherwise, but I honestly agree that student get benefits from being able to attend classes from home.

Giving students this benefit allows everyone to have the ability to keep up on their work, and make sure the ones who were absent get the same the amount of opportunity to earn a grade no different from those who actually attend school. This advantage also prevents teachers from having to re-teach a lesson and sometimes falling behind because of the absence of one student. Other students shouldn't have to be held back because of one person, but having this access to our work from home or other places gives us the chance to keep up with the class physically present or not. Having this benefit will keep everyone on one page and in sync, avoiding any confusions and up to date in the classroom environment.

Some students may have their absence due to disciplinary consequences or maybe a sickness. Suspension would be the only consequence that would keep a student from their natural learning environment. Even though that student may have committed actions that were obviously not good in the school system, they still have every right to learn just as much as the present student in school. This consequence is very reasonable but not allowing that child to have access to their learning isn't fair at all. Sickness is also a very common excuse on why students were absent. Not being able to learn because of the fact that you're ill is kind of like a punishment. Being sick is not a bad thing, and those who stay home for this reason should get full accessibility to their class work.

Now the opposite opinion from mine would be to think that this is not beneficial to students at all. Some may say the kids would slack around all day instead of focusing on their school works and it could never get done. At home there are no monitors around and cannot give the same kind of environment vibe that a classroom provides. This gives students the chance and opportunity to lead into cheating. Most who are against my opinion would probably have these thoughts about students learning from home.

Attending school does not strictly have to be from a desk in a classroom, the options we have today are also valid. Technology also has a huge impact upon this matter, and tech is advancing daily. The pros for this subject probably weigh out the cons, but everyone is entitled into their own opinion. The disadvantages on this new access are very convincing and reasonable, but this definitely is a benefit to those who do not attend school .",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
BD889A4D831B,"Students have to attend school to learn more efficiently, but long distance learning is not good because you have to take your own notes online ,however, if you were to attend school on regular time, you would not have to worry about taking your own notes. Although, online is still a option because you just need a computer or a laptop to take online classes, and not having to worry about missing the class when the teacher took notes that day. All you have to do for online school or video conferencing is get online and do all your classes, and not worry about getting to school. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.

Going to school than taking online classes or video conference is way better because you go to school and actually pay attention and not get distracted of what is around you in school ,however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when you're at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you. While you're in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if you're taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct. The information online could be outdated. while the information at school is planned out and ready to be given out by the teacher or staff at school. Even though, everyone would prefer online classes over actually going to school, people should consider going to school for a backup just in case the people taking online classes don't like how it is done. Going to school and learning just for being in class helps you in a lot of ways such as visually, speaking, and self control, however, if you're at home taking online classes it will only help on your visual learning.

Taking online classes can probably be difficult sometimes, because people can forget to take the class the day you need to log in ,however, going to school and knowing which days to go to school is very helpful because you can learn without any problems happening. Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, you're putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work. This is why going to school is more efficient. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention. Also students can have more time to work and can be actively speaking with our teachers too, for questinos and answers to help students. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B35CDBFBD6D1,"Some students stay home and take their classes online so they learn better and no socail life helps with you getting your work done but that not always the case of this situition .

Benfit of kids taking they class online or video conferncing dont mean they gone always wanna wake up to do it or they gone wait last min to go the classes on online and now they are late behide wiht their work and lesson and dont know where to start. Some kids probably wouldnt benfit the issues with them having to take school from home. When kids wake up they go for there phone their would miss out a whole 2-3 lesson for forgetting about about they got school work to do and that not good at all .

So some of the kids who not doing the school work at home probably would better doing it at school cause you other people and have a social life with other people and asking for help from people who got different ways of looking at stuff just like how you do . All this goes into how attend classes from home is a little bit of a bad idea cause it can also mess up someone inner thoughts by not having friend or not seeing every friends everday at like how they see each other and you might feel left out . Plus that make your friend like they cant do nun with you if you late behide work and you gotta make it up but they asking you can you go somewhere but you cant case you have stuff to do so thry might look at you like yea they happy for you and all but they probably want you to relax sometimes but you cant the wat you want to.

Also what if you wanted to try out for a sport but you taking classes from home for the school probably not gone be easy like being around people who really go to the school and see what goes on at school but you probably just watch videos or hear about it . So it would be the same as your friend and you pushing them off to do work cause you aint finish all you work so how you gone do sport if you having trouble doing your work .

So overall i feel like student/ kids shouldnt take classes or video conferencing from home cause it going to take away time from them to be them and take away their socail life with theie friend and not help them get a good thing coming from them as in with sport or if they wanted to join a club to that they like with the schoo cause wouldnt know how to get in it if they not phycically in school .",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
AF9939DC1EB2,"Many people want an education that is accessible to all types of students. Some schools are starting to offer online classes and video conferencing for students to get their education from home. More schools should start offering online courses because of students with severe social anxiety, students who get an extreme illness, and for students with gifted athleticism who need to devote most of their time to their sport.

Plenty of students have social anxiety but for some it comes worse than others. Some students walk alone in the halls because they just want to get from one class to the next with no interruptions, however, there are also students who do not choose to do walk alone because it comforts them. Social anxiety takes over their ability to want to talk to people and try and make new friends because of the fear of being judged or not accepted. With online courses they do not have to feel that sense of loneliness during school. They will be able to focus better and not have a constant fear of another student looking at them and making fun of them, they would not have to be scared of going to lunch and sitting alone, and their mind would be more clear from stress distracting them from their education. Students will be getting the same knowledge from an online course as in a physical school and they might be able to excel more than they would be in a classroom because of how comfortable they feel in their learning environment.

There are also ways to get kids who like interacting with people to still enjoy an online course. Students who get extremely ill and have to be out of school for a majority of the year but still love the face to face interaction with people can set up video conferences with teachers and get their education just as well as others. This is a great opportunity for students to stay on track with school when they are not able to attend school in a physical classroom. If schools do not offers these types of programs the school system would just be letting kids fall behind when they have no choice. No students want to stay back another year because they were got an extreme sickness. These video conferences and online courses can be the way to success for sickly students who need the little bit of extra help.

The one thing a student athlete could want is a little bit of help. Student athletes are working two lives, their school life, and their sports life. It is a completely different world for them and when it gets to the extreme some of them have no choice but to devote their whole life to their sport. Online courses might be their way to get the best of both worlds. Super athletes at a young age are offered a position on a professional team and asked to change their life so suddenly. They are not going to be regular kids anymore after that. The excitement builds up inside of them and they will take the great opportunity without even thinking of the consequences. If they get a career ending injury they will be done. Thinking their whole life is set for them to play a professional sport, thinking they do not need school anymore but as soon as reality hits them it is instant regret. Young athletes need to be prepared for the ""What if"" situation. Online courses can help them be prepared for these moments. They can fit an online course better into their schedule than going to a classroom for 8 hours of their day and still be getting an education. Most of a professional athletes day is training and recovery for the next day. Being able to spread out their classes and finding when it is most convenient for them to take online classes during the day would be a lifeline for young athletes. Playing a professional sport while being a teenager means giving up their normal teenage life but it does not have to mean giving up their education.

Some people may say online education would be too easy for kids and they need to be challenged in a classroom. At the end of the day an education is an education. Students can take that as seriously as they want to whether they are in a classroom, taking an online course, or having a video conference. The environment a student learns in is so crucial to the way they will be able to pass their classes to their best ability. More schools should start offering online courses and video conferences because of kids who struggle with social anxiety, students who get an extreme illness, and gifted student athletes who have to devote most of their time to their sport.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
69241D10E69A,"Online school a great tool for young scholars that might not graduate on time due to missing school days, or any other inconvenience. Online school could not only help scholars to graduate on time, but also help a portion of scholars that are looking to get a job for future education, or helping their households. Online school may also be a helpful option for scholars with disabilities, or illness that might stop them to attend school.

Although online school might be a good tool for some scholars it can also cause negative outcomes such as students not doing their assign work, or not passing the class due to less time with students. Other issues that must be faced ,are some students not having computers, or not having access to the internet to do their assigned work. Overall online school is a great tool for students that may struggle to attend school. Once its issues are met and something has being done online school may not be only a great tool for some scholars but also an opportunity to finish school without any issues.

In conclusion online school might have many issues but once its issues have being solved and students get help with access to computers, or internet it could make a big impact on young scholars. Online school may also help economy by allowing students to have enough free time to get a job to help in their households, and their future.

66031F0D0329,"Is quality not better than quantity? Technology has advanced to be an incredibly efficient resource that educators have taken notice of and have attempted to integrate within online schools and online programs. However, although online schooling is a quick way to receive an abundance of information, it is not always a quality education students are receiving. Students benefit less from taking online classes at home because the assignments are not designed for retention and the students fall behind in course work.

Although students may groan and complain about schooling, it is abundantly clear that students absorb the majority of information and techniques they are taught in school; however, the same cannot be said for online schooling. When students attend school, the staff has policies and measures put in place to observe if students are learning or are in need of help. If a teacher finds that a student is struggling, the teacher can meet with that student and confirm that they understand the material. With online schooling, however, the monitoring of students is made extremely difficult without direct face-to-face contact. Some students are too shy or too stubborn to ask for help; with online teachers relying on weekly video conferences and students emailing them with their concerns, an entire group of students are isolated and continues to struggle. Some may argue that online courses should be able to record student progress through test scores and quiz grades, but without a teacher to watch for cheating, many students use the internet to look up answers and falsely increase their scores. Without the ability to directly observe students, online courses turn to creating more assignments for students to complete in hopes of catching where the student is lacking. This leads to an abundance of busywork that may sometimes hardly pertain to the subject being taught and costs hours of the students time. Many students sign up for online learning to have a flexible schedule but are faced with the harsh reality that the coursework within online courses takes much more time to complete than the work within a class taken at a school. This causes many students to adjust their mindset from learning information to getting the workload down and done as fast as possible as the expense of retaining the material taught. Suppose a mother decided to pursue an online education in order to earn a degree while taking care of her child. The projects and assignments that are piled onto the mother has potential to distract her from her child. Prioritizing the baby, the mom begins working on the material with the goal in mind not to learn but to finish the work so that she is able to attend to the baby. She may complete the course and earn the credit but ultimately she would not absorb any of the information taught to her as she was overwhelmed by the busywork. The ultimate goal of education is learning and retaining the information and skills taught; online education fails to accomplish that goal due to the busywork it presents and the lack of direct communication.

Although students like to deny it, procrastination controls a large portion of students' work ethic. Many students rely on schedules and due dates to stay on top of assignments and as encouragement to start working. However, many online courses are advertised as flexible and only contain one due date for when the entire course ends. Although it may seem like a blessing to manipulate scheduling and due dates, many students fall under the control of procrastination. Even in physical schools, students push off their assignments and projects to the last minute in order to play video games or hang out with friends, but as the due date falls closer, students employ the dread of a failing grade to kick start their work ethic. Supporters of online schooling may argue that procrastination is not a valid reason for disapproval in online schooling since both online and physical schooling produce procrastination. However, while physical schooling leads to small, short periods of procrastination, online schooling allows students to procrastinate the entire course over months. In addition, procrastination is increased with online schooling as the students' homes act as classrooms. There are numerous distractions and comforts (such as beds and pets) at a students' houses that encourage students to put off work that do not exist in a physical classroom. Suddenly, as the date for the course to end nears, students scramble to finish the work they put off for so long leading to sub par effort and work from the students. For example, high school students have extremely busy lives between classes, extracurriculars, and spending time with friends. If a high school student were to take an online course and did not receive any due dates except for the date the course ends, the student would have no stimuli to begin working on the course. This may seem like a gift at first because the student has more time to hang out with friends or study, but as the end of the course nears, there will be no time at all for studying or hanging out with friends. Online courses boast a flexible schedule, but it does more harm than good. Students push off working on assignments until the workload is too large and then panic to finish the material leaving behind less than average work.

Although technology has made great advancements for society and education, it cannot replace learning with peers and a teacher in a classroom. Online schooling observes a students progress through quantity not quality and encourages students to push off large amounts of work. Online schooling completely misses the goal of teaching and allows students to complete a course without retaining any of the material, a issue caused from lack of communication. In addition, by eliminating due dates, students procrastinate up to the last minute and turn in sub par work. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
CF89338D76B5,"Schooling has been around for thousands of years, and, as the rest of society has evolved, the traditional schooling technique has virtually stayed the same. Children still remain at desks, listening to their teachers lecture; kids still take home worksheets for extra practice called ""homework."" Standardized tests are still given, and kids are still excelling. However, as time goes on, more people have begun to question this type of schooling, and why it has not changed for over 1000 years. A recent change people have suggested, with the rise of technology, is ""distance learning"", a way to ""attend"" school from the confines of ones own home. While this idea seems promising, it is not a good change for the schooling system because, for the vast majority of students, it will cause unneeded distractions, a less stimulating environment, and the inability to distinguish home and work life.

As children grow and learn, they are more likely to choose play over work. Because of this, kids are often distracted from their assignments in school, whether it be with the thoughts of their Buzz Lightyear action figure they can not wait to play with or with the drama on their cell phone. When children are placed in the sterile environment of the school system, these distractions are minimized because the child's surroundings are sterile, solely containing learning materials and peers who are trying to accomplish the same task. If a child were to attempt to learn at home, no matter what age they were, they would be surrounded with the temptations of play, and, even if they had the power to restrain, it would affect their ability to concentrate and retain information.

Continuing, the home simply does not stimulate the mind as completely as the school does. In a school there are hundreds of resources at a child's fingertips: libraries full of books, teachers full of knowledge, materials full of the ability to educate. While the home may have educational resources, the vast amount does not compare to that of a traditional school. Not only does a classroom have abundant learning materials and information, but it also has students who help each other grow and prosper in their learning environment. For hundreds of years, the traditional desk-and-chalkboard schooling system has been used, and over those years, people are still excelling and test scores are still rising. This is because the school stimulates the mind like nothing else; it allows children a place to let their curiosity wander and lead their education. To take away the school will take away the stimulation.

Finally, a common problem found in adults is an inability to separate home and work life; this begins at a young age when children fail to make the clear distinction between home and school. By allowing students to participate in school from their home, it will make this distinction even less clear which will not only affect the child's present life but also his or her future life as a working adult. when there is no specific time and place for a child to learn, their home and education lives blend together, often affecting both for the worse. An example of this is seen in Tara Westover, the famous author of the memoir,

Educated.

Westover was home schooled but was often given little time to learn because of her home obligations. This caused her to lack education as well as the knowledge that home and school are two distinctly different things. If students were able to mix their home and school lives, the negative results of an inability to distinguish The Home and The School would far outweigh the positives.

Many may disagree with this position, saying that this opportunity, to learn in the comfort of ones own home, would greatly benefit those who suffer from illness or other challenges that prevent them from attending school. However, the ratio of those who are unable to attend a traditional school to those who are is very small. Many students would take advantage of this ""distance learning"" opportunity and use it for an easier education rather than a better one. There are several types of accommodations one can receive for illness or any other obstacle that hinders their education; allowing any person, without such disabilities, to receive these accommodations endangers them and their education.

Although the idea of learning from home has been widely acknowledged, it has also been widely debated. There are several positives when one looks on the surface of this idea, however when one truly delves into the logistics of such a change, they will realize that there are too many negatives that accompany it. The home is too distracting and does not allow the proper stimulation for learning that a child needs to succeed in life; the lack of a distinguishable home and school life will also harm the child as he or she matures. If a change that is supposed to bring better and more accessible schooling to children in fact causes the opposite, this change will not benefit the education system. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
9E3359EBC812,"Long distance learning: An option that some schools offer, as an alternative to an in school classsroom environment. While most would think having an in school education is more benifital, having a schooling option that you can take at your own pase and in a comfortable evironment is more benefitial to a student. At home schoooling provides many comodities that an on campus school would not, allowing a student to have a better, more well rounded education.

While being on campus with a teacher for schooling can help with in person learning, most students will not get the one-on-one support needed to fully understand the curiculum. This is when distant, or online, schooling becomes helpful. Student have the oportunity to get the help they need for their teacher, without having the interuptions of a classroom environment, that can distract teachers and students. Most teachers do not have time to individual explain the lession to each student, so distance learning is an chance for a student to expirence this.

In schoool learing allows students to have structured time where they, each day, have certin time devoted to certian classses. While this may help students who need to have time planned out for each class to work, this does not benefit students who are struggling in one more than another. For example, a student might not struggle in english, but they do in math. And with the structured times of classes a student might not fully understand the lesson in a class period, causing them to struggle. But with online learing, classes can be taken at the students pase. So, if a student is struggling in math and not english, they can devote more of their time on a math lesson. They can even extend it if needed.

Learning inside a classroom means that the teacher is teaching on average about 28 students a class period. This mean that a teacher in not able to cater to each students individual learining style. But with an online classroom/ school setting students can have the oportunity to be taught in ther individual learning style. This may be through visual, audio, or textile learning. All of these can be used as an individual learnign styles in a one-on-one setting in an online environment. For examplpe, if a student is in a classroom and the majority of the students learn through visual examples, that is what the teacher will use. But the minority of the class may learn through texitle, meaning that they are not getting the full support and comprehension of what they are learing. But in an online stetting, the full lesson would be based around a students individual learing style so that they can get the most comprehension out of each leassion and gain the most of their educationl expirence.

The question of if students could benefit from online schooling is a simple one to answer. With online schooling, student have the opportunity to learn at their own pase and with their own learning style. Unlike in a class room on campus environment where studend learn in a group setting, all at one pase, and with one learning style. With learning online students can get personal and individualized education that can benifit them further in life. Students who do distant learing, whether that be online oor by video conferencing, have a more benificial education there their peers who have an on campus, in school education.                      ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
87B5969668D7,"Due to advancements in technology, we are able to achieve such lengths to acquire the ability to have long distance learning as an option. To be able to learn from the comfort of your home used to only come from home schooling; however, here in the era of information, people with the resources, such as a laptop or computer, are able to have the same experience and get the same result. While some may argue that an online course may not have the intensity or social aspect of a physical class; in the end, the content of the class is what you are there for and an environment that is more familiar may be more preferable for some. What makes online learning beneficial is that they provide an option for those who are disabled, gives courses for those whos schools do not provied such courses, and can help those who benefit from a more comfortable environment.

Conditions including the incapacity to move or being contagiously sick can leave someone bound to their own home. These conditions may take a lot of resources to get them out of the house and into a classroom where they are then able to learn. With the recent corona virus outbreak throughout America, many fear the contagious effects of the virus and thus would prefer a safer area to work in that is less risky than a public classroom. Those who are not able to walk can find it easier to participate in a lesson without going through the trouble of getting to a classroom. All these problems that get in the way of one's education can be solved by providing an online alternative that provides the same amount of engaging content and experience without the hindrance of one's conditions.

While schools provide a wide variety of career paths and lessons, one school can not provide all of them. Online courses can provide a wider selection to choose from whether it be a new language or a niche career path, online courses can have what you are interested in. Foreign languages is an interesting trait to learn as schools require students to learn a second language to graduate. But what best to learn of language from the source itself. With online courses, students have the option to participate in abroad classes to engage in a more natural learning experience without the issue of traveling and helps save money.

Many students have issues with a social environment. There are many cases of bullying and gang violence that can make one's learning environment difficult and unsafe. Recent school shootings bring concern to students and parents. Taking an online class from home can benefit those who are unsure about showing up in a physical class to avoid potential danger. By being able to take a safer option and still gain the same content a student wants to learn, then online classes provide that safe alternative

Online classes allow the alternative for those who want to pursue a course that is unprovided by their school, not able to attend classes due to a disability, or provides a safe and more comfortable environment to learn. Overall, schools should encourage online courses because of the the beneficial capabilities that come with such alternative. While some may not enjoy the usage of technology to learn, there should be a more welcoming attitude for those who may enjoy from it.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6FDF8A3FE345,"Many schools are now offering distance schooling as an option for those who prefer online school. However, this issue has met a lot of critism and has made people take side on the issue. With many thinking it will harm the current eduaction system and people's lack of ability to commutate with others in the outside world. While others are for it stating it to be beneiful to those who suffer from mental health or other related issues. I believe that distance schooling can be a postivie thing for many students who decide to attend classes from home.

First, many students espeically in generation z who are more outspoken about their mental health; benefit from it. Because many can have anixety disoders, depression, social anixety, etc. Many students have or had suffered bullying while attending a public school. Most of the time this leads to young students delevoping social anixety when making friends, presenting presation that are forced upon them for a grade and daily interactions with other people. Bullying is an esstential cause of this probelm as many of the kids that bully pick on the targets that are vunerable and who look different (Race, religion, sexual orention).

If distance schooling is an option that many students can afford it will atomically elimate these causes for bullying. This solution that distance schooling offers will not only prevent bullying and help boost many students' self of steem; it will also help those who need more one on one attention to understand the lessons better. Because in a class room with 20+ students the teacher is limited to the amount of people he or she can help in a spam of a one hour class block. Distance schooling could possibly help those who struggle in subjects they are weaker to help them succed. Which could lead to a higher passing rate among students and in eduaction in general.

In addition, with the prevention of bullying and the possibilty of helping those understand the concepts better; there is also a higher chance of stress reduction among students. Most schools require students to take 7-8 classes a day. Espeically in high school, this comes with a huge amount of workload done in the spam of an 1 hour and a half class block and endlesses packs of homework due the next day. In public schooling lots of students claim to be under lots of pressure with the amount of assignments due on thier schedules; leading them to suffer from the apporiate sleeping schedule, time to spend with family, and depression. This even makes things harder on students that have to work part-time to provide for thier families. Nevertheless, with every known online schooling you aren't required to take so many classes a day, the time you spend on school work is miniumized by almost half and most students are able to get a healthy 8-10 hours of sleep compared to those who go to public schooling. Distance schooling can have a postive impact on these students espeically those who work. Many comapnies that hire teens at 16-17 are obilatgated to work around the schedule with thier employed minors. This allows them to have some time to rest and it takes off a temonous amount of pressure in thier personal lives. It allows these teens to have more engery to work more hours or do other activites in the community. Which will be a more postivie impact on the mental health of growing teens.

However, most aruge that distance schooling can be harmful to many. Due to the many reasons of lacking the ability to socialize with others, not learning about responbilities at a young age, and missing out on the high school experience. Many aruge this because especially teenagers need social interaction with others. Many claim that with distance schooling, students will become accostumed to 'interacting' with others via techonlogy and will not be able to have face to face interactions. This also brings concerns of isolation and deeper depression as a result of onlining school. Which could become a probelm considering that once these students become adults, It is neccasary for them to have a job in order to surivie. Most jobs require some kind of social interaction such as public speaking and leadership skills. Also, many teens will miss out on the high school experience of school dances, football games, being in clubs, sports and other activites only experienced in high school. They will also not learn how to balance thier daily life responbilities as an adult with the school sytem making students have 7-8 differnet classes a day. Despite the amount of pressure that is forced among most high school students; some teens have claimed to enjoy going to school to interact with others. In most cases, public schooling helps them escape issues in thier personal lives espeically sisuations at home.

In conclusion, many have different views among this topic. Some strongly disargee with the arugement of missing out on social interaction and the high school experience. But distance schooling will not affect those missing out on the high school experiences or will lack thier social interaction skills. Many of these students can still get part-time jobs and interact with people on a daily basis, parpicate in the community and have lots of time to interact with thier family and friends. especially with social media revolving our world. It is much easier for teens to stay connected to others. I think that distance schooling can have a huge postivie impact on many students espeically for those who work or have mental health issues.

It can help students improve on thier ademic skills, sleeping schedule, reduce thier daily stress and prevent a lot of bullying. Distance schooling has the potenial to become the future of eduaction.      ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
B60BD5B9D118,"Traveling to school has become a hassle to students. With transportation being limited to the person's zone, many have found it very difficult to attend school. Now that technology has advance, though, it has made it easier to learn and teach certain individuals that may not be able to make it to their classes by video conferencing. At home learning is offered at some schools, which help many students that could not make it to their classes. Students would benefit from online conferencing because they would be able to attend classes on time and they would not have to worry about transportation.

Although some may disagree by saying students would most likely wake up late and not even do the actual video call, most of the high schoolers have became accustomed to wake up early. From interviewing students, at least eighty-five percent have claim to wake up at a very specific time. As they have been waking up at a certain time, it has become a habit that benefits them to attend they classes with this form of education. This body alarm clock that everyone will certainly help students be on time to call for their instructors.

Students always worry about their transportation. While some buses come on time or early, others come very late or not at all, which causes an obstacle for many that do want learn. This has been a major problem that students have no control of whatsoever. The opportunity to stay at home to attend classes without worrying about if bus 69 has arrived could make an abundance of student's learning experience easier. While many may argue that student should provide their own ride, it should be noted that most wait to get their license at the age of 18. That is around the time that most will graduate. Even if they have their parent or guardian to drop them off, it pays a heavy price to the driver who may have a job that requires them clock in early. Which is why an online call is a better option for students.

The obstacles that students must endure to travel to school has become tremendously difficult. The option to learn from the comfort at home is very stress relieving. Students would not have to worry about waking up early for a bus that might not even be there because an online conference would help them succeed academically. Attending classes would be so much easier with this alternative teaching method.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BE4764F7BFF1,"The Downside of Online Classes

A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home.

To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we don't want to do the work, but it's our minds. Everyone's minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work.

Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances, football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldn't go to a public school and decided to take online school instead.

Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldn't want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I don't know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable.

On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons.

Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
56D96BC94CD1,"All Schools should offer distance learning because i feel like it's a great idea for the students to participate in class when students aren't feeling well, away on vacation, and any other reason students couldn't make it to class. Distance learning will help so many students on missing class assignments due to being absent. Usually, students who miss class end up having to make up work but with distance learning, students wont have to worry about missing any assignments. Distance Learning will benefit all students with any kind of reason for being absent to class. Students with a type of injury that keeps them from going to class should have some type of way to attend class when they physically can't.

Schools should set up different types of distance learning programs such as online or video conferencing. With having the ability to video conference the class students can't attend, it will teach them to be responsible with always attending class no matter what. These programs will help students from having their grades go down and passing the class.

Bullying is also a problem for some students and it keeps them from going to class. If schools came up with a way for bullied kids to attend class with out actually being in that class, students who are being bullied in their classes would want to go to class. Students sometimes cut class because they are being bullied and don't want to deal with it so they skip class and miss work, distance learning will help those students. With distance learning class skips will most likely decrease.

All public schools should definitely consider distance learning and help out all the students who miss class due to various reasons. It will show that the school system actually cares about their students and are trying to help out however they can. All students who get the access to distance learning should be grateful that they are getting the education they need wherever they feel safe and comfortable.         ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
E3097287CBD1,"Some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won't learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help.

Some student often have a bad day so they often don't pay attention and they just don't do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that's okay because no one is watching them. Many of them don't learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student won't benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they don't have someone to talk too.

Online classes don't benefit students because they don't have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they won't get it because they don't a teacher with them. so they just don't understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they won't do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes won't help student in their life. one example is that they won't have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don't know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don't have the opportunity to chat with them.

When students get video conferencing they don't really understand because something the video don't really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing.

Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. let's Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest, but they did'it because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport.

Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they won't learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work. In my personal option school should not have online classes or video conferencing. Student are going to have a better knowledge if they go to school and, they work with teacher. School should let student enjoy take their high school life and not have online classes.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
74823E250780,"Are you battling something in life right now that you just can't attend school everyday or even attend it at all ? Do the teachers in the classrooms move to fast for you to understand whats actually going on ? Are you taking care of a sick or injured family member ? These are some things that will take away the chances of students going to school everyday, but there benefits that will help kids that are having these sorts of problems in life.

My first reason is having to take care of a sick or injured family member. In some families students that attend schools has to take care of someone thats sick or injured because that's who the sick or injured person only has in life. Some days the students are not going to be able to go to school because they have to watch after them, and some students can't even make it to school at all. I have a friend name Generic_Name, and she has a brother name Generic_Name that she takes care of everyday. She doesnt attend school at the moment because her brother is special needs, and he needs her help throughout the day while their parents are at work. Generic_Name makes sure her brother eats, takes his medicine when needed, and bathes every morning like he's supposes to. Generic_Name is not able to go to school like the rest of us, so she takes online classes instead to make things easier for her. It allows her to do the classes whenever she wants or needs to, so if she's busy at the moment helping her brother it won't affected her classes online. Even though Generic_Name doesnt attend school her dream is to graduate like the rest of us and get her diploma on time.

Another reason is the students thats has cancer, a disease, or even on suicidal watch, and cant make it to school because their doctor tells them not to go or they can't go. If there wasn't a online or video conference to help these students out, they would've had to drop out of school until they've got better and sometimes they don't even get better. My sister has a friend name Generic_Name and she's suicidal. Generic_Name tried to kill herself four times because she couldn't take life for what it was anymore. She ended up having to stay in the hospital for months because of what she was trying to do to herself. Since Generic_Name couldnt go to school she started falling behind in all of her class assignments and started failing the classes too. The school brought across Generic_Name families attention that she could take the classes that she's falling behind on and failing online until the doctor says shes able to go back to school. While Generic_Name was in the hospital she took all her class on the computer, and even video conference with her teachers to get a better understanding of the assignments. When the doctor told Generic_Name that he feels thats shes ready to go back home and go to school, Generic_Name was passing her classes with A's and B's. Generic_Name ended up graduating High School because of the online and video conferencing with her teachers helping her get an advanced diploma.

My final reason what if the teacher is moving to fast for the students to understand whats going on. Sometimes in class teachers move a lot faster than what students can understand. When teachers are moving faster it makes some students fall behind because they can't keep up with his or her pace. Taking the online class can help the students a lot more because they're going at they're own pace and actually understanding what they're doing. Theres a lot of people I know that takes online classes because it helps them out more than what the teachers can do for them in class. Letting them take the online classes help them pass the classes with A's and B's not C's or D's, and making them feel more strongly about the subject than before. Helping them push their GPA up way more than what it was before taking the online classes.

Online and video conferencing can help a lot of kids in it's own ways that some people dont even know. Just think about how many people will get a chance to graduate, and get their diploma with using this method for more help in their classes. This is a different but smart technique that will help students in the future grow up with the help they need in life. Using this will flip student worlds upside down from the bad, and making it the best thing they ever did while they were in school. The online classes and video conference helped a lot of people, and can even help someone that you're close to in life thats going through personal problems.         ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

39B6908F453E,"Many schools allow students to work from home, never having to set foot inside the school. There is an ongoing debate over online classes and if they are beneficial. The opposing side state that online classes are hurtful to the students and stunt social skills but this is not true. Although some may disagree online classes are beneficial to students.

Online classes can improve a students ability to learn comfortably. Students are not constrained to mandatory school hours and can maintain a schedule that suits them personally. No longer will students have to endure sleep deprivation from the grueling hours of traditional school, and how it damaging it can be to adolescents. Not having a set class time students can spread classes throughout the day if they pleased, not having to attend them all in a row. Students can learn at their own pace, instead of having a set learning time per subject. Without a set amount of time learning in class online students can spend as much time as needed on a class. Now having a flexible schedule means learning at the time of the students personal preference not from seven o'clock in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon which can put a toll on certain students. Going to such a large, closely populated building can cause stress and social anxiety for many students. Not having to deal with so many forced interactions that cause stress to so many can be a major relief for some. A large portion of students despise the time when the school system throws them into the midst of their peers and expects them to learn to the best of their ability.

While online classes can be a relief for students, it also builds independence and better work skills. Students attending online classes are less likely to be stressed as a normal student. Without anyone forcing students to a strict schedule of work and learning can provide stress relief. Without having to worry about an awkward social situation provides a sense of security with introverted or less socially skilled students. Online students learn many independent skills like time management, that is not set for them by the school. Students in traditional schools often have trouble managing their time without a set schedule. Online classes support healthy independence in adolescents. Students will not have to experience the harsh environment traditional school offers. All over the United States, students experience a hatred for school because of the harsh environment they were subjugated to. Not all students experience this dismay for school but an overwhelming amount do.

Although some may disagree online schools are beneficial to students. online classes help students become more comfortable learning and, also develop independence better than the average student. with all the positives online school can limit the social interactions students have with there peers, yet I believe the positives outweigh the negatives.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
1AD65D131BE6,"As more and more schools are being build around the globe, so are the ways people can go to school expanding. With the way that the internet works improving so is its educational uses such as online learning, Students of schools that offer distance learning as an option for attending classes in the form of online or video conferencing at home are benefiting greatly because they are more comfortable, have an easier time going to school, and have more available online resource.

Student that learn at home are benefiting from a comfortable environment that helps with learning and retaining information. When learning in a comfortable environment, you retain more information and in turn do better at a task such as test or quiz, for example a social science study demonstrated that a student who is learning in an comfortable environment will score more on a test than a student that is learning on an uncomfortable environment. This is because students on a uncomfortable environment will have a harder time paying attention or remembering information as they will be on alert or unfocused. Student that have access to distance learning can learn from home allowing them to create a comfortable environment to learn in. This will in turn help them with maintaining the information they have learn and doing better on assignments and tests.

Humans are often located in urban areas where everything is near and they have easy to access to everything but not everyone lives in these compact areas, in fact many people live in isolated rural areas surrounded by nature with building miles apart from each other. As a result many students have to take risk everyday in order to go to school or travels miles everyday in order to get to school. For example, In some rural areas a broken tree can be the difference between going to school or not. As they only have one dangerous road to travel in, so if the road is blocked then they can't go anywhere. Students that have access to distance learning benefit from not having to take risk or have difficulty going to school as they can learn from home. These students will have their lesson taught online allowing for those that live in rural areas to stay safe and learn from home.

One of the main arguments against distance learning is the lack of communication that spawns from online conferring. This issue is no longer as present as before with the improvements in technology and as new online platforms are appearing that help students to interact, ask question, or review lessons are being created and are gaining popularity such as Edpuzzle, Khan Academy, Google Classroom and much more. An example of relatively new online resource that has been integrated into school lessons is a platform name Edpuzzle, it is a website that allows teachers to post online videos to all students in their class so that they can watch lessons and answer questions about the video. It also have the added benefit that students can review previous videos and teachers can schedule when the lessons are posted for convenience. Students that are learning from home via distance learning can benefit from websites such as this because teachers can see exactly what questions student understood and what questions they did not and adjust their lesson accordingly. They can also review past video lessons and and see future assignments.

Overall, students would benefit form distance learning offer by school. As students can learn in a comfortable environment at home helping them maintain and retain the lessons taught. Students also have an easier time going to school as students that could not go to school or had a hard time going no longer have to leave their home to learn. This is all thanks to the fact they have more learning tools in the form of online platforms or websites that helps them learn outside of school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0AFAD06336F3,"Attending classes from home is not a good idea. I think it's better to attend classes at school for many reasons that

I have experienced at home. It's not fun becuase you don't have any teacher to explain to you what you don't understand (well you will have a teacher but he or she wont be there personally), you won't get any help from no one if your taking the online course. Also student will not benefit it because they will be off track and instead of doing there work or what they are suppose to be doing, they will be wondering around by the internet. I defenitly do not agree that the student will benefit attending classes at home.

`

Having a tecaher with you in class is wonderful. There will be a point when you will have so many questions about the topic that you were discussing with the class. When your in class at school you will learn so much from teachers by giving out examples that are being giving out to the class and explaining it to you. But if your taking an online course It's defenitly more difficult for you to understand the main idea of the lesson. We won't have a teacher right next to us. We have to work indepentdently with out a friends help. It's not similar to when your in class and you ask a friend for help, they will love to help you out. Online class you won't have a friend helping you out. We have to take so many notes in order to understand the objective of the lesson. I personally had so much trouble with the online class, I had to take about 3-5 lessons each day, I had to write down notes for each lesson, I had to take at least five quizzes each day. I had to re-read the lesson like threes time in order to understand and capture the important facts. Honestly you learn how to be more organize and independent each day. I personally consider students to attend classes at school. It's not a good idea doing online class and taking so many notes.

In class, tecahers are strict when student have there electonic out whil there tecaheing or when student are working on class work. At home and doing your class work and at the same time being on your phone, your not paying fully interest on your class, Since you home, don't have a teacher, you feel like you have the right to be on your phone and laptop and do what ever you want, and not doing you work. That shouldn't be the case if you stay home and take the online class, It's because to there was a purpose. If we don't pay attention to what we are doing, and we are paying more attention to our phones we will never learn anything abiut the course. That could cause use to fail the class. Than, we got to re-teake the class.

In my opinion I will also agree to some student that wants to take the online class because you can wake up late, taking you time to eat breakfast. It's not like going to school having to get up so early, not having the time to eat, and having to chase the school bus. I'm that type of person that loves to sleep. But it's our responsibilty to do our work and tun it on time before the deadline. If you dont want to fail the class you have to save some time for your class than, you have to save some time for your self and for school work. Not all the time it will be about you. There needs to be some time for something else more important.

In conclusion, I think Student will not benefit from able to attend classes at home. It's a lot of responsibility to remind your self that have to attend class at home, do all your work and turn it in on time. We wont have a teacher with us (personally), we have to do all our work independently. That's why I think it's not a good idea for students to attend classes at home.                                      ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
478B474A0A00,"Many schools offer classes from home or online to students, however it is contreversal whether it is beneficial to students or not. Students will benefit more from going to school rather than taking classes online or from home because students will get the opportunity to join clubs or sports teams, learn better social skills, and gain more life experience.

Going to school gives students the opportunity to join many different clubs and sports teams. When in high school, there are so many opportunities and options for students to choose from no matter who you are. When I first came to Generic_School in the 10th grade, I missed the tryouts for the Volleyball team. I was upset, however I was still given the opportunity to manage the team where I met one of my best friends and made new relationships. I would have never had this opportunity if I had taken classes from home or online. This year I am a junior, and I recently joined National Honors Society, which is a very good club to be in and looks great on college applications. This is another example of an opportunity that is not presented to people who take classes from home.

Going to school teaches students better social skills as well. Being around teachers and students all day can allow people to be better at communicating, rather than just being at home or online. School is where I have met almost all my friends from preschool to now. If I had not gone to school I would have never met my friends or had the same relationships, so I would not have been able to talk to other people my age as easily. Being around teachers and authorities all day also helps with adapting ways to talk to adults and to know how to be respectful. High School has helped me a lot with knowing how to communicate better and to speak up, before I was very shy and would rarely talk. Altogether, Going to school helps people to adapt better communication skills.

Life lessons and experience is another example of what going to school provides for students. When attending school you naturally will experience and learn more then what you would if you were at home, whether or not it is apart of a lesson plan. Teachers and adults teach students basic discipline and give rules, which can be good. Even when I was a kid, I was taught to not interrupt people and how to get along with my fellow classmates. Going to school, I naturally experience more every day then what I would if I was at home or online taking classes. This can be as simple as just listening to another student, or our teacher telling the class an important life lesson. It is important that students get to experience what going to school can teach them.

Although some schools offer distance learning by staying at home or taking online classes, it is important to go to school. By choosing to have distant learning students will miss out on school clubs and sports teams, adapting better social skills, and many life experience and lessons",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
2.04E+11,"Students are expected to wake up earlier morning and attend school for 7 hours a day consequently for 5 days per week. Moreover, students must balance sports, jobs, homework, and extra curricular activities. The constant pressure of having to find the perfect balance among everything leads to stress on a student's brain. In an attempt to alleviate this issue, schools have begun to offer alternative options such as online classes. Some parents may argue that taking classes online is not in the best interest for young students as it prevents the growth of social skills. However, online school would, in fact, help students gain social skills as they are able to have more free time for sports, jobs, and even hanging out with friends. It also would help students gain the skill of time management. Overall, the ability to attend video/online classes from home would be beneficial for students because it would help reduce stress and anxiety, provide more personalized learning for students, and allow for a more flexible schedule.

The overall environment of school has been known factor that leads to stress and anxiety. Generic_School in Generic_City is one of many overpopulated schools in the country. In the mornings, traffic is backed up all the way to nearby housing communities and shopping centers. During class changes, the packed hallways have caused panic attacks as students are barley able to navigate. In attempts to solve this issue, students have been switching to online classes while taking only a couple of classes in school. Students with anxiety are able to either come into school late, leave early, or both to avoid traffic and the crowded halls. This reduces anxiety for students as they are able to avoid big crowds. Mental health is extremely crucial to take care of in order to provide the best performance in school. With the long school days and commitments to other activities outside of school, students receive little to no sleep. Taking classes online would allow students to get more sleep as they arrive to school later. Sleep is one of the most beneficial factors in terms of reducing stress. Less sleep would increase anxiety and result in poor performance in school. As attending classes from home helps reduce stress and anxiety, it also helps with population control among schools.

Students can get more personalized in regards to classes on the internet. Instead of having a fixed 7 hour school day, the doors open for students to work at their own pace. Pacing allows young students to gain the skill of time management, which will help them in the near future. Students will very likely be able to learn more efficiently and score higher on tests as they can take things slow. On top of pacing, students are also able to get more one on one help with video conferencing. The ability to ask for individual help allows young cohorts to be more interactive with the knowledge, which in return, helps memory retention. As class sizes are growing in public schools, individual help is not always readily available, so with video conferencing, help is available more quickly. With online classes being more personalized to students, they are also provide more flexibility.

Working on school classes from home allows more flexibility with other activities. Student athletes spend a large amount of their time on sports as they train to get better. Generic_Name from Generic_School plays travel volleyball. She got offers to play at multiple different colleges, however, in order to be able to attend those colleges, she needs to constantly condition herself, which would cut into her regular 7 hour school day. In this scenario, online classes would help her schedule as she would be able to do attend school and play volleyball without anything overlapping one another. This will help set a path for her future. Along with sports, comes jobs. With young cohorts coming from the lower side of middle class families, teens start working as soon as possible to save up money for college. Online classes would allow teens to be in school for a shorter time as more time is open for teenagers to be working.

Online classes, in conclusion, are a great idea as they benefit people in all aspects. Taking classes online would provide students with flexible schedules, have a more personalized style of learning, and would overall reduce stress and anxiety. With flexible schedules, students are able to achieve more outside of school, specifically, in regards to jobs and sports. They are also able to get more individual help as they gain the abilities to be more proactive with their learning as stress from the crowds and traffic from schools decreases.

439605C44328,"Distance learning is on option thats schools offer to allow students to take classes from their homes. The way that distance learning classes work is that you attend the class online on a computer or phone . Distance learning might sound like a good option but has more downsides than your traditional classroom. Students will benefit less from distance learning because the learning environment is less controlled than a regular classroom.

Some might say that a teacher can just supervise students taking distance learning by using a virtual classroom or by means of a live video feed similar to Facetime or Skype. This looks over the fact that theres only so much a teacher can do from behind a computer screen to ensure their students are learning, if there is even a teacher supervising at all. The class might just be a teacher that puts up notes and lessons to a website for students to look at. If the class is taught in a traditional classroom along with students taking distance learning via a virtual classroom, the teacher cannot always be watching over the distance learning students while they are keeping track of students in their classroom. If the class is only made up of students taking distance learning, taught in a virtual classroom, the teacher may never be sure that the students are focusing on lessons when the student is at home.

While at home, there are more distractions from keeping a student from learning. At times, a students biggest distraction is themselves.

Some students may take advantage of being at home to go to sleep, watch TV, or play video games. Students are more likely to fall asleep at there comfort of their homes than in a classroom. If it were a classroom, a teacher would make sure that their students are awake and paying attention.

Also, some students may feel like procrastinating more often and catching up with class notes or discussions later in the day. At home, students will not feel the same sense of urgency to get work done than they would in a classroom.

To ensure that that students are learning the nessisary information, the teacher obviously has to give out test. Testing students taking distance learning can be a huge problem due to cheating. Most of the time, if not all, electronic test giving to students at home are cheated on. The students just look up the answers on their computer to get an easy passing grade. If the test has a video feed, students can just have notes out of the cameras view. With no teacher physically present, it is almost impossible to keep cheating to a minimum.

Furthermore, classes taken from home have less benefit than a traditional classroom because there is no authority over the learning environment. Classes at home are less controlled, have more distractions, and no reliable way to prevent cheating.      ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
67787C34A08F,"Some students despise being in class all day long and are always complaining about coming to school. As technology is getting better everyday, an opportunity has come where students can be taught at the comfort of their own home. Teaching online has become a new way for students to stay focused and on track while staying at home. Either through video call or online course learning, it is a easy way for teachers to get the information we need to us, and students to able to comprehend the information easily. Distance learning is a new and easy way for students to learn because they will be able to be in a comfortable learning environment; furthermore, the students would also always be on time and ready to work because of how advanced technology has become.

Students will be able to be in a comfortable working environment; as a result, they will be focused and on track with all of their work. School can be very fast paced and hectic getting to all the classes on time and ready to learn. The hallways are crowded and loud, and the very next minute you could be taking a very important test. Some students believe that it is very difficult to be running around the school and trying to focus in class. Being at home in a quiet place before taking an important test, or just learning information, is far better than being in a crowded area and trying to focus on your work.

With technology becoming more advanced, getting to these classes would be very fast and students will always have access to it. Students would also be on time to these classes because they won't have to leave their own home. Teachers would also find it very beneficial because it is a lot of one on one time with the student. Teachers and students would always be working together and the students will have the best opportunity to learn without any interruptions. Aside from technology, another reason why online school would be beneficial is that students skip meals during the day at school because they may not have time or may not want to pack a lunch. With online courses, students can eat healthy meals and exercise in their free time which will lead to a healthy lifestyle for the students.

Although there are many benefits to online classes, many people are skeptical about this. People believe that students will get distracted in their own home by video games, YouTube, or the internet. This may be true because many high school students get distracted easily but this could be where parental ad vision comes to help. Parents could set boundaries on when to use video games and the internet. This would help the students by not being tempted to distractions and the students would focus on school. Another reason why people appose distance learning is that students won't get the face to face talking ability with teachers. This could be solved by video chat and one on one help by the programs that can be run with the new technology.

Online courses is a new way for students to learn and stay focused. Students will be in a better learning environment and they will be on time and ready to learn everyday with new technology. Students aren't the only ones benefiting, teachers will also have time to help the students one on one which will be the best opportunity to learn. Online courses should become a learning tool because the benefits are too great to pass up on.            ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F693E138BDAB,"Imagine being a smart student, but, because of personal issues is not attending classes. Your main goal is to graduate and you are willing to put in all the hard work until you receive that diploma. By being able to attend classes from home not only will you be able to study on your own time, but will also be able to do it wherever you are. Online classes will not only let you take your classes at home , but will also be more helpful since its more one on one learning. Students would benefit so much from being able to attend classes from their own homes.

There are many students that do not attend school but do want to graduate. Being able to receive your lessons from home would benefit in more students graduating. Many students would take the offer of learning from home because it is simply more earlier to attend to. The environment that schools provide for some students is not the best, therefore some students do not like attending. Online schools would make those students feel better and more relaxed while learning. They would be more focused on learning and less on the drama and the lives of others. More students will learn more without the struggle of having to physically attend school. Overall, more and more students will end up learning and graduating because of the convenience of online schools.

Being a teacher with a classroom filled with around 30 students per class is difficult. being a student in one of those classes is even worse, especially if you are confused or have any questions. Teachers can only teach so much and in so little time and sometimes will not even have the time to answer all the students questions especially not reteach lessons. That is why online school is very helpful towards students who have difficulties in learning. Not every student learns at the same pace or is able to understand everything. In online classes if a student has a question the teacher is not able to answer the student can simply uses their resources and search up the question. There of thousands of sites where they might be able to find the answer. Learning online is made easier because the lessons are usually more one on one with the students. This means that the student does not have to worry about the teacher not answering their questions and are more able to understand the material being taught to them. Online classes are usually made for your own style of learning. Online classes make it is easier for students to learn.

Having to wake up everyday for school is very difficult, especially when you spent all night studying for hours. Many students suffer from sleep deprivation and are not getting enough sleep, thus causing them to wake up late for school , or, even falling asleep in class. Something beneficial about online school is that you do not have to wake up so early in the morning, or, even get up from your bed. You can sleep in and wake up later all fresh and ready to start learning. You can also take online school on the go. If you have a long trip, you can simply take your laptop and you will be good to go. Online school is very convenient, especially to those who are busy, but still want to receive their diploma. It also makes it easier to study and have a life of your own. Unlike public schools, online schools provide convenience from your own home.

Online classes will provide help for both students that are having difficulties in their classes and students that just can not make it to school. Having online schools will increase in students learning and graduating. It will also be easier for students to carry around with and focus on.

AD25C95CC18A,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I do not believe students would benefit from being able to attend class from home because cheating from websites on the internet would be made easier for them to use, students may not have access to internet or a device that allows them to complete their assignments, and students who are not present in the classroom would miss out on working on their socializing skills with their fellow classmates.

Cheating would be facilitated to the students who are not being supervised and do not have a teacher to go to and ask their questions or concerns. Since the students would not have a teacher explaining and answering their questions, it'll seem easier to them to rely on the internet for a response to their questions, instead of learning and retaining the information. There are countless websites on the internet that will provide students with detailed answers to the questions they have searched and would be easily able to copy and word the answer differently to their responses on the assignment. They could not only access quick and detailed responses from searching them online but by also asking other family member that has already taken the class or the subject.

Students who are absent and who may have limited access to internet at home would be significantly placed at a disadvantage than their classmates. Students not having a device to complete their assignments on, would contribute to placing them behind and without an opportunity to keep the same rhythm the classroom is being taught at. Students may be placed in a situation where internet access is not available or they are physically unavailable to attend the video conference due to family emergencies or illness. Some students might feel like the students who are being taught online are given the advantage of cheating and getting the same grades as them, resulting in tension within the classroom.

Students who attend the class online or by video conferencing would not be able to experience the social interactions that their classmates, who are present in the class, would go through. Interacting and working together to complete group projects or presentations, would help with students with their public speaking and combining the input of different types of students. This kind of social bonding would lead to the students learning new things, not only about the subject of the project or presentation, but of the people they worked with.

All these simple interactions help build up a character in the students that prepares them for when they apply for a job or go to college. The students who are not present in the classroom would miss out on these important lessons and learning experiences that would benefit them in the future.

I believe that students would not benefit from attending online or video conferencing as a way of attending class due to the risk of cheating, limited access to devices or internet at home, and students would be excluded from building social skills that they may need in the future. I understand that some students may learn better alone and in a quiet place like their home. However, these students would be missing out on learning a significant part of attending classes. If your school were to suggest this option of virtual learning, write a letter to your schools Board of Supervisors or your principal, listing these reasons as to why students would not benefit from distance learning. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9947BA6C3149,"The option of distance learning can be helpful for students in many ways. Internet have the access of having to take classes online or communicating with a teacher. Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job.

Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some student's lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives.

Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems.

It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate.

In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education.

04F4F6D2ABE2,"I believe it would be beneficial for the students to do the distance learning,and because it would benefits the students to get good grades. Just imagine how good it would feel to get good grades,and not to get distracted from others. The first reason, is that some students need a quiet place to think and learn,and to payation to their class work,and to have the right to have a break at any point if they needed. For an example, that I have a friend that does this because he is autistic,and he needs quiet place to work on his classes,and he makes good grades too. This matters because students need a quiet place to learn and do their work,and some of those students have disibiltes that they need a quiet place to learn. Therefore by doing the distance learning opinion it's beneficial for the students that needs a quiet place to learn.

The second reason, Is that if a student has really bad anxiety,and can't be around a lot of people because they get really stressed out,and so if they do the distance learning option the student wouldn't have the problems any more because they are doing school work at home so now they mabey can good grades. For an example, I would do this because I have a lot anxiety problems,and I get really stressed out about school and my home life. this matters because the student needs it because they need to Handel there anxiety problems,and so there school work till they are fixed. Therefor it would be beneficial for some students that have bad anxiety issues.

The third reason,is that the students that has problems at home a lot and they need to stay home to help some times they could distance learning option. For an example in 2017 I missed a lot of school because my mom was in the hospital,and I had to help my dad till my mom got out of the hospital. this matters because in some student lives are going through a rough time at home,and if they can't show up to school they could just do distance learning option,and so they could get their school work done if they can show up to school.

in conclusion, I believe that the student can do this to help them to get passing grades or having rough time at home,and it good to distance learning as a option for the students.                            ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
3D670976A2FE,"As a student who has struggled with many medical issues through out my middle and high school career, it was not always feasible for me to attend classes when I was receiving treatment or undergoing medical testing. Online schooling was recommended by my counselor and has helped me tremendously academically while also allowing me to devote more time to my health. Online schooling wouldn't just help students with special accommodations, it would benefit the school as a whole if classes were accessible on days when school is canceled due to weather, or on days a student can't attend class because they are sick.

While some critics of online schooling may say that access to classes online will allow students to easily skip class and not learn the information being taught, in reality, online schooling makes schools more accessible to students with needs that can not be met in a classroom setting and allows student to continue having class even on sick days or days of weather cancellations.

Every young student looks forward to a snow day and sometimes even a sick day if it means they get to skip school, but as students grow older and start to narrow in on their post graduation plans, they often feel as if they can't afford to miss a day due to illness or weather. Online schooling would take all the stress of missing class away. Students that are sick would be able to continue receiving and submitting assignments in their own home. They would also not feel pressured to attend school on a day they don't feel well and risk possibly spreading the illness to other students. On days where the weather is too severe to send students to class, online classes would allow curriculum to continue without risking the safety of the students. It would also cut down on the need for built in cancellation days for extreme weather. Allowing classes to continue on sick days and weather cancellation days would increase overall attendance and allow students and classes to stick to their original learning schedule. This would improve the school and student's overall GPA and academic success.

Students with needs that are not being met in a classroom setting would benefit from having an online class option. They would have more time to tend to their personal needs while still having access to a complete education. Many special needs students who are attending schools that do not offer online classes are forced to move their education to a home school based option or to a private school that is better fit to support them. This, sadly, causes these students to miss out on the many class based and extracurricular opportunities that public schools have. It has been through my public school's vast variety of learning experiences that I have discovered a passion for science, art, and swimming and now have a clear vision of what path I want to take post high school graduation. Without these experiences, student will be less involved and less willing to learn, decreasing their academic performance and overall success in and out of school.

Most critics of online schooling argue that students will take advantage of online classes and will use them to skip in school classes. At my current school, there are regulations and rules that prevent this from happening. Students without accommodations are required to attend school if there is not a valid excuse for an absence. When there is an excused absence, it is assumed that the student is looking over the materials being missed online. People that have accommodations will most likely have a meeting with a school counselor or social worker at the beginning of the year to decide what schedule would work best for the individual. Some students may be required to come to school for part of the day, and then have an off campus wavier for the rest of the day when they have online classes. Others, may opt to have online classes all day and require an off campus wavier for the entire day. These students would then be required to check in to an online program within a certain time, or meet with a teacher that would come by their house to make sure they are completing assignments. No matter what, the student's attendance would still be taken, whether it be online or in class.

Online classes have been beneficial to many students at my school. I believe that if more schools were to offer online schooling, they would see a rise in the overall success of the students and it would create a safer, more inclusive environment for everyone involved. While it may be a concern that students will attempt to abuse the online system, as long the school has rules in place to prevent misuse it won't be an issue. Online schooling overall, will make schools more inclusive and accessible learning environments and allow for student to receive a proper education no matter their personal circumstances. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

It could be a good work out to get up and go to school, you'll never know. Although, some may think going to your classes on your computer or phone is a good thing but,I rather go to the actual school.

Some may argue,staying home for school is amazing because they think its going to help them way more in school. Lets be real one of the biggest reasons is that there lazy.

They would think you'll get to wake up whenever you want to. If your having trouble in a class or you just miss a lesson you can always go back to the video conferencing and re watch it. To me I still dont think thats enough evidence and detail to say I would stay home.

Other people would say going to school is the right place for it. Everybody can't do things on their own time they would end up forgetting. Some people would have to be force to do what they got do do somewhat like me.

They would be outside or somewhere other then working at home before going outside. Another reason is what if you don't have internet or a computer;You will have to do your work at school unless you want to find a local library.

The teacher might speak slower or just not as clear as every one else is because of the type of computer.

For example,if they glitching you not going to understanding the lesson she is teaching you.

Furthermore,in school would be in a better learning environment then it is to be at home.

A student family could be a loud family causing him not to be as successful as he would be if he was at school. One of their family members could go to his house while he watching the video conference and distract the student from learning. If we think about it, it can help you be prepared for the real world for working. Can make you on time for your job as in getting up early. Going to school everyday is a big part you can't go on a video online to start working at a job.

Although, some may still think going to your classes is a good thing i don't agree.

Some students don't take school in a serous matter like other students who cares about their education;Students that don't care will most likely use online classes as their way to get out of doing work. Allowing people to have a option would be a huge change in the school system.

In conclusion i believe my central idea is supported and with well given reasons.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
CC44D32FF288,"I feel that as if my school were to do online classes it would not benefit me or other people that much from being out of school because something could happen with the computer and we cant do any of our work that we need to do.

If you're taking online classes and you have a child this would not be a good fit for that person because its a lot do to at one time, but being at school can help that person relax a little bit and get the work they need done. Another thing about taking online classes is that you may be more isolated or feel isolated due to the fact that you are inside most of the day on you're computer taking classes, this is where some people realize that you can not do as many things as you would like to do in regular school. When you are at school you are more free do do more things such as hands on or free time to make up work that you didnt finish also you dont have sit stay in one place for the entire time you are working.

When you are at home taking online classes you may feel as if you can not complete every task that is needed or you dont have enough time to finish it, some people might have a hard time asking for help from a teacher but if they are with friends at school it might make it easier to understand. About 75 percent of students are doing good in school and most of them have decent or good grades, but if the government asked all the schools do do online classes permanently the grades of almost all the students might fall because of personal issues, isolation or just due to the fact that they feel they cant concentrate at home.

Although a student can live far away from the school that they are supposed to attend and the parent or guardian can not support transportation for their child at the moment there are buses from schools that can take students from one school to another. Another big issue with doing online classes is that if you are doing this at home and you are in your bed you can dose off and fall asleep and you will be behind on a lot of things that you missed while you were sleeping and you were supposed to be doing, this could cause you're grades to start to drop and you will then regret requesting to do online classes. Online classes are a lot more work then you realize right now and you will soon start to feel very overwhelmed by it, also if you are taking a test for your online classes you will not know what to study or even have the right notes for it. Late assignments are a major reason for low grades and you will most likely forget to turn those in if you are doing online classes, because nobody is there to tell you to turn your work in. when or if you do make up your missing assignments it might be too late to turn in and you might not even get a grade for it .Assignments might not be completed if you are sick or do not feel good enough to accomplish the papers to were assigned to do for that day because if you cough all the germs get on your computer and you will not get better by still touching something that you coughed on.

these are my reasons for believing that kids, students and or adults will not benefit from taking online classes or video conferencing from home ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
29C1E2CE5DB3,"Attending clases in online will not be affective compare to taking clases at school. Students focus more in school because teachers are cheking on them all the time. At home students could assealy get distracted by video games or other staffs. Also not all students will take online clases seriously beause it will be more eassy for them to skep classes.

Attendding classes at school is more combinent for students because in school students can make friends. Share with new people. In school students can be able to make projects in groups wich they migh not be able to do in online classes. If teachers assing students projects, the school most of the times provides students supplies that they need for projects: like books, computers, and others. Also students can get help from other classmates or from other teachers at school. At school this is a way that makes education more fun and interesting when theres other people around us to help or to get help from them.

There are many clases that need to be done fisicly. One of the subjects is P.E class wich is more practical. Another can be sciens classes where students get to learn a lot by doing experiments with chemicals or other materials. For example in biology where students used mycroscophics to learn about cells. This are clases than won't be benefit taking them in online. Because acivities like experiments will not be able to do and theres a lot that students will not going to learn or experimented.

School has a lot of opportunities like programs or clubs that online classes won't offert. Academy's are one of the most benefit courses that students can have at school.

A lot of students are depending in these courses that Academy's provide. This classes has to be taken in school because there so much that has to be learn by activites in gruop. Also like photography class it would be worthy that students take classes like this in online. This are classes more practicals is not just concepts. Same with art class and music class.

In conclution attending classes in online will not be productive as taking classes in school. Because school offerts so much more than online classes. Also School opens a lot of help and clubs and resourse you need for education. Therefor students shoul not choose for attending classes in online because they have more opportunities at school.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
81EB648B5B51,"Distance learning can occur through various means and technologies, but the main purpose is the same across the board. The central focus of distance learning is to allow students to learn even when they cannot be physically present at school. Distance learning has been used before for both long and short periods of time including snow storms, illness, or a mental issue. Although the intentions behind distance learning have just reasoning the widespread implementation of this type of learning would have detrimental effects on students across the country.

Distance learning takes students away from other students their age which not only isolates them, but also hinders their communication and collaboration skills. Many times throughout a school year students are given projects to work on as a group which not only allows for the students to meet new people in their age group, but also allows for them to develop communication skills. These projects typically have some sort of reflection at the end so that the students are able to discuss who in the group put in the most effort which encourages all of the students in the group to try their hardest and collaborate with each other. Part of this collaboration involves working around each others schedules and sacrificing time to check over each others work. Sadly, the skills learned from these projects cannot be learned when utilizing distance learning. Not only are the students unable to meet up in person to discuss their project, but online schools typically shy away from giving group projects due to the difficulty to work around other students schedules. Thus, distance learners are taught to be independent when completing work which can only serve to hinder them when they enter the job force.

Many classes, especially science, complete various different types of labs throughout their course. These can include labs with chemicals, animals, or even virtual labs. The ability to complete these labs not only allows for students to better understand the topic that they are being taught, but also allows for the students to have hands on experience in a safe setting. Unsurprisingly, the same is not true of distance learners. Due to lack of materials, teacher guidance, safety equipment, and a safe area to complete labs distance learners are unable to get the same hands on experience as those physically going to school. This absence of labs hinders the learning ability of the students and retention of the information they are being taught.

However, in extremely serious situations distance learning is able to be beneficiary for students. One of these cases includes the very recent COVID-19, or corona virus. Distance learning, if implemented, will allow for students to remain at home and hopefully away from the virus while still being able to complete their lessons. Not only will this allow for the students to not fall behind on their school work during this period of time, but it will also allow for the school district to not need to add in extra days to the school year. Other cases in which distance learning can and has been implemented is in cases of students contracting mono, having severe eating disorders, or having some form of anxiety. All of these examples allow for a brief period away from school for students to recover before they are able to return again.

Distance learning is a tool that should be utilized by schools only when student(s) are in dire need of time away from school. It should not be utilized as a replacement for school due to its ability to only teach independence, and hinder the collaboration capabilities along with social skills of students. Additionally, distance learning does not allow for students to receive hands on experience or access to laboratories. Despite being effective for short amounts of time, distance learning should not be implemented year round due to its ability to hinder the growth and learning of students and because of its lack of benefit to students not suffering from a mental illness or some form of sickness. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
287F79B6D6F6,"After a long and tiring day at school, students often look forward to returning home to retire in a stress-free environment. People's homes remind them that their strenuous day of work has come to an end and that they can now comfortably enjoy their home alongside the company of their family and friends. Students have come to have a negative perception of school as it exhausts their energy and causes them stress. But what happens when they choose to attend their institution from the comfort of their home? Does their home, a prior safe heaven from school, gain a more stressful connotation? School and home are two very important, but separate, institutions that students should not make the mistake of combining. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn.

First, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted. Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home.

Another reason students will not benefit from attending online classes at home is that they will be less motivated to learn. Many students will agree that a commonly enjoyed perk of going to school is to meet and mingle with friends. However, when students study on an online forum at home, they do not get this opportunity to engage in conversations with peers as there are lesser chances to forge a personal bond with the students in the class. If learning online removes some of the greatest opportunities a student has to establish bonds and friendships, is it really worth it? Students need to know the faces and personalities of the people in their classes to gain a confident observation of each of their classmates' beliefs. Lighthearted conversations with one's peers are a key to developing relationships, and without the assistance of such relationships, students are likely to lack motivation in their goals and studies. Additionally, students will lack motivation in their coursework if they have less need to participate during lectures. An online study forum greatly hinders a student's ability to communicate with peers and take part in group discussions. These discussions are essential for a student's success in core classes as they captivate the student and make them play an active role in the class. Being an active learner provides students with the necessary skills to communicate with the professor and their peers, as well as to actively observe the essential components that are being discussed in the classroom's environment. The lack of opportunity to discuss topics with another student can create an uninteresting perception of that class and make students less inclined to partake in class activities and lectures. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending classes at home as they will be less motivated to partake in the class when their abilities to create relationships and be an active learner are hindered.

In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. If students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. Also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. The inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. Likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. Nobel Peace Prize winner and educational activist Malala Yousafzai once said,""a paper and pen can change the world."" Yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance? Education is a powerful tool that we must use to guide the future, it is not something that we can compromise on for comfort.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
F29244150DCB,"Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who won't take this seriously.

I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don't have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren't prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don't have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases.

As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them.

Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasn't a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes.

My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn't do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can't happen because we are the future.

In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
E1571FAF496E,"Imagine never going to school again! instead you could take all your classes online from home. Online classes are very beneficial towards students who are unable to attend their classes at school. There are many reasons why someone may choose to take an online class. They could take their core classes online so they have more time to work towards their goals and their chosen electives during the school day. For some students, they might not have space in their schedule for the classes they want to take during the school day, so online courses would resolve this issue. Also, some students may not learn well in a physical classroom because they feel anxious and timid. In an online classroom they wouldn't face those obstacles, rather they're able to learn freely. Why choose to take your classes in school, when you can take them from the comfort of your own home. 6

How an online class works is that it's held at a certain time every week. During this hour long session the teacher turns on her video cam and goes through a power point teaching us what we need to know for the week. Afterwards, there are several assignments that are posted in Google Classroom that we must complete before our next class. This is done so you have the same workload as the students who take it in school. To be able to excel in your online course you need to manage your time very well. You should be able to balance your in school classes and your online classes, as well as any extra curricular activity you may have. 6

There are many reasons why someone might take an online course. The main reasons are either push or pull. A push factor would be something that forced you to take an online class. A pull factor would be something that attracted you to take an online course. An example of a push factor would be if your school shut down and you would need to complete your courses online. For example, the threat of corona virus has caused some schools to shut down to keep everybody healthy and continue their courses online from home instead of coming to school. An example of a pull factor would be if your schedule was full and you wanted to take another class so you decided to take it online.7

Another great reason that online classes are beneficial are that the class you want may not be offered at your school so you can take it online from your home. You might also live far from the nearest school and do not have a form of transportation to go to and back from school. Online classes would allow you the same education that is given to someone who physically shows up to school physically. This would be a push factor. A counter argument could be that some families might be not having a laptop to use for your online courses. I think many schools are starting to give out issued laptops to their students. If that is not the case or they dont have WIFI, they could always go to the nearest library and make use of the resources there.

In your online class there are going to be many students from many different schools, and the teacher that will be running the class could also be from a different school. You would take the online class from wherever you want, until it is time to take your midterm and final. During the Midterm and final you will be asked to go to the teachers school and test in person to make sure there is no foul play. Even though you are at home and can cheat on many things, you should not. Not only because its against the rules, but also if you score 2 letter grades below on your midterm and final than your overall grade, it would seem as if you were cheating and it you could get in trouble. Overall, it doesnt matter if you were a push factor or a pull factor, online courses are beneficial to students no matter what circumstance you are in.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
8E35C504B480,"Techology has become a very large part of our society and plays a big role in our everyday lives. As technology continues to advance and people are presented with new opportunities we didn't have before, we begin to rely more and more on technology instead of ourselves or other people. Many schools have proposed the question, ""Should students be able to attend classes through video conferences at home? Would they benefit from it?"" Allowing students to do this would only hurt them and their futures. It is evident that students need to continue to attend school in person in order to learn how to work with other people, make friends and meet new people, and be able to see teachers when help is needed.

It is important that students continue to attend classes in person so they can learn to work in groups, preparing them for their future. Many, if not all, occupations available for students in the future recquire them to be able to work with others, and share ideas with other people. Working in groups, also allows students to become comfortable sharing their ideas with other people, teaches them to accept criticism, and helps them learn that two brains are better than one when trying to solve a problem. Most importantly, working in pairs or groups teaches students to respect the opinions of other people, even if they don't agree with them, causing them to be more respectful and accepting of others in general. If students were not recquired to go to school, they would miss out on the opportunity that would prepare them to work with other people in the future.

If students ceased taking classes in person, they would no longer be able to meet new people or make connections with friends as easily as they would if they saw them every day at school. Polls have shown that a majority of the friendships students in elementary, middle, and high school have, were formed at school, with few being from extracurricular activities. Going to school, students are surrounded by the same people every day, and are put into classes with a variety of different people, whom they usually may not connect with, where they are able to establish relationships and become friends. This produces more outgoing and friendly people who are able to get along well with others, boosting their self confidence. Students who take classes online would be unable to meet new people which could severely effect their happiness and cause them to feel isolated or alone.

Often after being taught new lessons, students are confused and have questions to ask their teachers. Being in school allows students the opportunity to ask teachers for help and ask questions. Studies show that it is easier for students to learn when face to face with their teacher, watching what the teacher is doing. Many students actually learn from being walked through problems or equations with their teachers, asking questions, and then trying one on their own with a teacher nearby to help if needed. If all students were to video chat with their teacher and try to learn new topics, they would find it very difficult for each of them to be able to ask their questions and grasp what they're being taught, thus causing their grades to slip. However, if students continued to attend classes at school, they would be able to go back later and ask the teacher for help, or find another teacher that could also answer their questions.

Attending school in person, as opposed to online, provides students with an environment in which they can learn to work well with others, make friends and meet new people, and ask for help when necessary. All of these things are extremely important to the development of students both cognitively and socially, allowing them to grow and learn as children so that in the future when they are out on their own, they can prosper as responsible, outgoing, and intelligent adults able support themselves. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
AE425A221021,"Did you ever take online classes? If so, did you like them? Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Having students take classes online would be beneficial because they would be more independent, have more time, and get more sleep.

Many people believe that having classes online wouldn't be beneficial for students because they wouldn't have any one on one help with teachers, however, having classes online would be beneficial because they learn to be independent. For example, a teacher is there to help you out in whatever you don't understand, but many students then only depend on the help of their teachers without even trying on their own. Therefore, if classes were online, students would have the ability to learn how to be independent in their work.

Another reason why online classes would be beneficial for students is because they would have more time. For instance, let's say a student gets out of school at 3pm and has football practice after school everyday til 6pm, that student doesn't have enough time to get their homework or other responsibilities done and it's not only him, there are many students in that situation. Therefore, if classes were to be online, students would have more time in their hands in which they can work out a schedule to complete every task.

The final reason why online classes would be beneficial for students is because they would get more sleep. For example, students on average sleep 6 or less hours a day, this affects their activity during the day, like the simple task of just concentrating in class. Therefore, if classes were online not only would students have the opportunity to sleep earlier, but also have the option to sleep during the day without anyone yelling at them to wake up and pay attention.

In conclusion, I strongly urge you to think about the benefits having online classes would have on students. It would not only be a good idea for students, but also for teachers. It would be beneficial because students would learn the skill of independence, have more time to finish tasks, and get more sleep.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Students like myself hate waking up at 5:30am, 6:00, or earlier, some students would get more work done, and students wouldnt get in as much trouble. Taking your classes online has its pros and cons. Some students like taking online classes and some dont. If they offered online classes everywhere it would be very beneficial to the academic scene.

Most students hate waking up at 5:30, 6:00, 6:30 in the morning. But with online classes students can wake up at a more reasonable time and take the class whenever they want. Waking up that early and going to school everyday is stressful for most students. Some students struggle to make it to school/class on time because they wake up late. For example, I slept through my alarm and I woke up 45 minutes later than i should have woken up. I missed my ride and I was tired and late to class. Most students are tired because some dont get a full nights rest of sleep. Some might go to sleep at 11:00 or 12 at midnight due to their jobs or their personal life.

Students would get more work done. Most students would get their work done more consistently. Some students hate the fact that work has to be due on the same day or they're rushed out of their comfortable pace to work on their classwork/homework and turn it in. Some students work slow and teachers dont understand that sometimes. For example, some students didnt finish a project that was due in 3 days and the teacher didnt care and gave them all zeros because they couldnt work at her pace.

Most students wouldnt get in as much trouble. Some students get in trouble because of their friends and sometimes because of the teachers at the school. Sometimes the teachers are disrespectful and causes the student to get angry and lash out. Most of the times its their friends that make them do dumb stuff and make them get suspended and miss school. If students did online school they would be controlled by someone they will listen to. Students hate listening to teachers and thats why they get in trouble too.

Schools should offer online school worldwide because most students hate waking up at 5:30, 6:00, 6:30 in the morning, students would get more work done, most students wouldnt get in as much trouble.

B9DABCFD687D,"Being able to take online classes from home, is something that i would like for all schools to offer. Graduating high school is a need in this time and generation, for the reason being that most jobs ask for at least if you graduated high school. There is lots kids in school and not all have the time to go to school, some kids have to help there parents work for there not financially stable. I myself have gone through that where had gone to an alternative school so i could have more time to work in the day and come home to do some of my courses. Many people say education is the number one thing you should worried about and thats right, though some kids can't cause they have to help there family to provide in relation to paying some bills, put food on the table or picking up there siblings. providing school to be done at home will help the kids that have to go through all of this.

high school can be hard at times work is stressful some kids hate to having to get up early is hard for them so they miss out in some of class time. You keep missing some of class every day it can turn into hour's of class time that you missed, also can effect in the way you are learning having more time in your day to work can help you for there you are learning at your own paste, not the teachers. Some students that learn slow. takes time for them to learn one thing and by then the teacher is on the next unit there learning about. everyone has there own way that they learn better students that are fast learners wish that they can learn everything faster to get the class over with to go on to the next. those students can get classes online so they could do them at home to get the most credits they want this would also help them graduate faster.

Very few kids know what they want to work as for there career. Doing online classes can help these students graduate earlier to go the school they want to go to, or there career they want to lean on. This can help these students out in many ways. Going into a career path the earliest you can is a great thing you can get more time to learn and get good at to what you want to be doing like working become a master tech the younger you are the more experience you could have when you get older. The more chances you can get to become the best master tech at your location.

8846B3225DEB,"Ease is something that we have in spades nowadays. We are used to being able to order something at the click of a button from our cell-phones. Now some schools our offering to add more of this ease by offering online classes that you can attend from home. Whatever good intent those school staff may have, this is not a helpful move for those students. A physical classroom and in person attendance is for more effective. Physical classrooms offer hands on learning in the forms of labs and activities, chances for teachers to answer individual questions that the student may have, and offer less distractions than taking an online class from home.

Actions often speak louder than words, and in some subjects that is often the case. Learning about pressure and how it affects molecules in Chemistry and then getting to put in effect often helps cement what the student just learned about in their minds. It's this kind of hands on learning that the online learning is taking away. Often times students will be more likely to remember something if they see it in action and are able to put it into effect, than just hearing about the subject. Teachers implement these activities and labs for this precise reason, to give students a break from hearing them speak and to get up, move around, and implement what they just learned! Students using the online method do not have the chance to do these activities. They would have to be content with just learning about the subject. Take, for example, a subject like Chemistry as I mentioned before. In Chemistry there are loads of examples of labs that students will to, such as labs with dry ice or butane gas, showing laws of partial pressure or states of matter. All of which done in a classroom setting, not something you could do while looking at a screen.

It's safe to say that over time school subjects increase in difficulty. With lessons getting more complex over time, it's up to the teachers to help teach the students the best they can and answer any questions they might have. Most students's questions will often vary depending on how they are and how well they understand the subject. They will have individual questions, and in a classroom setting it makes it easier to pick out the student and answer the student's question and explain it. With an online class, that gets trickier. To do an online class, it would most likely be come kind of large video stream; with a teacher on a video and a couple hundred students tuning in online. This makes it immensely more difficult for the teacher to single out a student with a question. Look at a subject such as math. In a classroom setting, if a student had an issue with one of the math problems, all they would have to do is raise their hand and the teacher would come over and show them how to do it on a white board. With an online class, you would not be able to do something like that. A glaring issue for the online classes versus the physical classroom.

Something that all students suffer from in any class is the threat of getting distracted. Sometimes when a teacher is talking, the mind and eyes are prone to wonder around until the mind is brought back around to the lesson. If a student were to take a class from home, the distractions would be amplified. Often when a students mind wonders, it might be to something that the student would rather being doing at home. For an online class, the student would just have to walk around their house to find something ""better to do"". While in a physical classroom, the student eventually is forced to round their attention back to the lesson at hand, by the presence of the teacher and lack of objects that the student can use. In the home environment, the student doesn't have the presence of a teacher and their home is full of devices the student owns and can play with. While the student could have their parent come around and simulate that teacher presence, a parent will have other things to do leading back to the mess of distractions that will form.

The online classroom may have some advantages, such as being a way for sick or injured students to keep track of schoolwork, but it is outweighed by the disadvantages. The lack of hands on activities to keep the student interested and and to help cement the recent lesson being one. Another being the inability of the student to ask their individual questions directly to the teacher, and the last is the overwhelming amount of distractions that can arise. The online classroom is a decent idea, however in order to be as effective as the physical classroom it needs to make adjustments to mimic the physical classroom.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
A0E6B7240C25,"To begin with, imagine never going to school again. Most seven hour school days are wasted away due to many interfering factors, so schools should offer online courses for students to prevent wasted time. Although taking online classes will not be beneficial because some classes require a teacher present, schools should offer more online classes because students can get their work done faster, students can work at their own pace, and students can have more time for recreational activities.

Firstly, working at home has many advantages for students because they can get their work done faster than they would in a school environment. School environments can be distracting because of annoying bell rings and loud students, and sometimes it is just best to avoid all distractions and stay at home to do work. Students can work faster because they do not have to wait for the other students in their class to finish their work. Students are more productive because they can move on whenever they feel like they are ready to, accomplishing more. Also, students will not have to drive to school or walk to class saving time that could have been used to get work done. The extra 30 or 40 minutes saved from traveling could be used to do a whole classes work for the day, making taking classes online so much more worthwhile for the student. A home environment helps students stay focused and less distracted because school environments have so much going on it is hard to hone down on school work. Overall, attending classes from home is beneficial to get work done right and fast.

In addition, another benefit from online school is working on a self created pace. Some students work slower or faster than others and can not succeed properly in a school. For the slower students, they can take the extra time by having long period breaks to rest and to understand the topics to their full extent. And for the fast students, they can advance ahead and potentially complete their classes early in order to either move on to the next subject or move on to college early. Another reason to have online classes is for students that want to have long summer breaks or move on to an occupation if they manage their time right. Since students that work from home can create their own pace to follow, it is beneficial to offer online classes to accommodate every type of student that goes one school.

Lastly, since students can finish all their work fast, they will have more time for recreational activities to broaden and strengthen their mind outside of class work. The extra time allows for more family bonding. For example, most students do not get home until 4:00pm, and if the student plays a sport, they do not get home until around 6:00pm or 7:00pm. This leaves hardly any time for talking or bonding with their parents, so if online classes are taken by the student, then there will be more time to create a healthy relationship with their parents. Also some families take far, long trips out of the US, causing in school students to get way behind in their classes or even fail them. Thus taking online classes are beneficial to these families to keep their kids educated. Some students already have professions that interfere with school hours. For example, PROPER_NAME is in high school and she is a professional surfer that is constantly traveling abroad for competitions. Her surfing profession has caused her to miss a tremendous amount of school her junior year. The following year, her school offered online classes allowing her to maintain her grades, as well as surf to her best ability. For this reason, schools need to offer online classes to allow students to travel and continue their professions, as well as bond with their families.

In conclusion, schools should offer online classes because they can benefit students by allowing them to work faster, allowing them to work at their own pace, and allow them to focus more on their professions or hobbies while still getting educated. A prediction for the future is that students will be overall more productive and schools everywhere will have the technology to accommodate online students. Ask your school if they offer any online classes and apply for them next year for a better, more productive year.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
ABBA50242CFA,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasn't even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you don't understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think it's better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they can't make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because it's their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.          ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
9FEDA127135A,"Nowadays, technology advances is very useful in the education system notably for students. It allows them to communicate through the internet, without being physically present at school. Students are using their devices to complete their work, also attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? They would not be concentrate what the teacher is saying when they are surround by their friends in class. However, some people say that it is benefit for students to attend classes from home which is true, because they would pay more attention, also It reduces the death at schools.

Allowing, students attend classes from home by the way of online. It is a great opportunity for certain people who are not able to go school for some medical issues. For example, students who has disabilities to move or not suppose to go out. They could make a video conferencing and complete their assignments from home. They would be safe and feel happy that they are part in the society. Moreover, it can also decrease the risk of bullying suicide that happen in schools. For example, in the past days, a student commit his own death, because his friends was telling him that he is fat which is not nice at all. Schools are a pyramid of knowledge. Teachers should civilize students by teaching them the risks and inconvenient of bullying. Students tend to kill themself just for bad words. It would affect their life in the future by committing crimes. For example, school shooting, they have a discuss and get mad by their co-workers or friends. This kind of things make them feel that they are frustrating by the society. One day, they come school with a gun to get revenge by shooting people. which will give schools a bad reputations.

Some students have a hard time to focus in class. Attending, school from home by online or video conferencing will help them, so they can pay attention in class without being distracting by their friends. For example, some students love making jokes when the class is quiet. They will get others people is attention, so no one will focus on. Some of them want play games when they see their friends and helping each other cheat on their test. Distracting, students during class could fail them, because they would not understand their assignments. Concentrate, will allow students to pay more attention and have a good understanding. Staying at home can make them feel comfortable. For example, some students are too shy to ask questions in class. Using online or video permit them to ask questions by sending email to the teacher, and participate in class.

In addition, schools are priority for all students to be attend. Somehow, students can attend school through online or video call. It is very helpful for students to be concentrate. Also, it can decrease schools shootings and students suicides by bulling. In order, for students can learn in a safe environment.    ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
C5F5F1D83B63,"Some schools are beginning to offer ways that students can attend class through online classes or through video conferences. These options would give the student the ability to attend school from home. This would positively affect students who struggle to learn in the normal classroom environment and It would also have a positive impact on students who fail to make it to school.

These online options would have a positive impact on the students who struggle to learn in the classroom setting. One problem students may have is that they struggle focus and learn from a teacher in class. This problem would be improved if they had the option to take classes online that are centered around the best way for them to learn. In a normal class a teacher often teaches the same way to everyone but the reality is everyone learns differently. Another problem students may face is, anxiety. Some students have anxiety and find it hard to learn with others. Online classes would help them learn a topic at their own pace away from situations that may keep them from learning.

Another way, online classes would help is with students who are unable to make it to school. The most common reason for students missing school is that they are sick and are told to stay home. This happens every year and these students who have to stay home often miss multiple days at a time. This causes them to fall behind and it can be difficult to catch back up. With online calls these students who have to miss time at school can still learn while keeping away from others. Another way students could miss school is if they simply do not have transportation to school. Many parents often aren't able to take their kids to school leaving them to ride the bus. During this time, students often wake up late and miss the bus. If they had the option of joining the class online they could continue to learn and this mistake wouldn't put them behind.

With these points, many often say that if online school was added then it would take away from the classroom experience and interactions. While this could be true to students who only take these online classes, this doesn't mean that the real classroom is disappearing. These classes are meant for certain situations or students and are often used as a second option.

Summarizing, many schools are beginning to offer online classes or video conferences for students to use from home. These options would have a major impact on most students. It would help students that struggle to learn in a classroom and it would help students who can't make it to school. In order to ensure that these online classes can become options, this topic has to be introduced and explained to the school board.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
18DFC8ABFA92,"Students . . . imagine being able to wake up for school in the morning but not have to leave the house, this can become a normal reality for all students enrolled in school if they were allowed to take their school courses online. People work better in an environment they are most comfortable in, which would be their home. Students would benefit from taking classes from home by being in the comfort of their home, not having to find transportation, nor having to interact with people in person if they're shy or antisocial.

Being in the comfort of their home can benefit students when working. If Generic_Name was in a school where he got bullied and picked on for his extremely small size then he would not want to be there but rather, somewhere where he feels safe and comfortable. When Generic_Name tries to do his work, all he would think about is what the other kids are saying about him or what they'll make fun of him for during lunch. When Generic_Name goes to school and has to sit in a chair all day in class, he obtains back problems. If he were at home he could sit on his bed and move around to stretch out his body to stay loose therefore, making his back not get any aches. Students being able to work in a place they're most comfortable could make them more productive.

Not having to find transportation to school would make things tremendously easier on students. Generic_Name's parents both work away from home for the Government in Generic_City. and her house is in Generic_City while her school is in Generic_City, 30 minutes away, so there isn't a bus that comes to get her therefore, she either doesn't go to school or takes an Uber, when her parents can pay for one. If Generic_Name could take school from home then she wouldn't have to miss so many days and her parents wouldn't have to pay for Ubers most of the days. Generic_Name lives 1 mile away from her bus stop, that she's supposed to walk to every morning but, she doesn't want to walk alone in the dark and her parents can't walk her because they have to work so, they try to get family members to drive her to school but most of the time they're busy. If Generic_Name was able to take her classes from home then she would'nt have to worry about walking in the dark in the mornings, where she feels scared but instead, she would'nt have to leave her house for school. Students being allowed to do school from home, would'nt have to find transportation, when they don't have it.

Students who are antisocial and don't want to interact with people, would'nt have to, if they took school at home. Generic_Name doesn't like to talk to people in person because he gets nervous and then blacks out, like when Generic_Name asked for his number during lunch break at school and then he fainted in the middle of the Cafe. If Generic_Name could take school at home then he would'nt have any problems with getting nervous then blacking out or fainting. Generic_Name doesn't talk to anyone because she gets very awkward around any new person she meets and embarrasses her self, like when Generic_Name asked what her name was in Science class and then she farted on him and fell out of her chair and onto the floor. If Generic_Name could take school from home then she would'nt have to socialize with any new people and embarrass her self. Antisocial students being able to take school from home would allow them to only have to interact with their family, that they already know, and no one new to them.

By being in the comfort of their home, not having to find transportation, nor having to socialize with people in person, when they dont want to, students would benefit from taking their school classes from home. Students can be more productive in the comfort of their home rather than in a public place, like school. Students without transportation to school, would'nt need to struggle to find any if they took their classes from home. Antisocial students would'nt be forced to socialize when they don't want to, if they got the chance to take their classes at home. Students would benefit from taking their school classes from home, online or through video conferencing. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8F88ABD06CED,"The primary goal of any school is for their students to do the best they possibly can throughout their years of education; However, many students around the globe do not thrive in a traditional school environment and opt for an alternate form of learning such as homeschooling. In addition to homeschooling, distance learning is an option that various schools offer in which students are able to attend their classes at home via online courses or video conferencing in place of going to school. While there are many parents, teachers, and administrators that say distance learning is not a suitable way for students to learn, others could argue that distance learning is an innovative solution that not only increases the responsibility of a student, but also accommodates personal situations a student is going through. Overall, the ability to attend classes from home would be beneficial to many students due to the increase of independence, lack of distractions, and flexibility it provides.

As a student gets older, the amount they are responsible for increases in order to prepare them for their adult lives. Allowing students to take their classes online would only aid in teaching a student to become more responsible by enabling them to make their own decision on whether to open their laptop and attend class or not. This also gives students the opportunity to plan their own schedules more freely because they are not limited to attending class in a school classroom for seven hours of the day. Instead they are able to take their class while traveling or perhaps, in between classes they are able to complete errands and become much more productive. While many adults would believe that students would simply just decide to skip class and go on with their day, allowing them to take online classes would in fact promote responsibility and productivity within the student.

What goes on in a students life could have a large impact on their school performance. When an injured student is attending school, moving from class to class can prove to be very difficult and could also cause them discomfort. Taking classes online would allow the student to heal in the comfort of their home while still being able to obtain the learning material as if they were in school. This could also indicate that online learning does not have to be a permanent solution for all students. Along with being a solution for physically injured students, this could be very beneficial for student athletes who have suffered a concussion. The harsh lighting and loud hallways are factors that are proven to irritate a concussed student, therefore by allowing them to take their classes at home once they are cleared for instruction, they are able to focus on their classwork without risk of feeling sick due to the commotion of a classroom. It could be argued that disrupting a students daily schedule in this manner could cause more harm than good but by allowing students to take their classes online when injured, it allows them to heal with minimal discomfort while missing no class instruction.

It is proven that students learn in different ways, many students get very distracted by the aspects of a traditional classroom, such as harsh lighting, disruptive classmates, and the loud bell signaling for a class change. Attending class online eliminates those distractions by placing the student in a comfortable environment in which they would learn best. Adults could argue the fact that a student's home could open the opportunity for more distractions, the location where a student takes their class does not have to be their home. While many students find their home to be the most suitable place to take their classes, some students could prefer a public library or coffee shop. The ability of taking classes online also means that if their usual location is not ideal one day, they can easily move to a different location to help aid their focus. Online learning allows students to place themselves in the best location for them to achieve their work.

To conclude, the topic of allowing students to take their classes online is very controversial. While it may not be suitable for all students, online classes would benefit many students by allowing them to grow more independently. It would also make learning much more flexible to the student and eliminate typical distractions that you would find in the classroom. The ability to attend classes from home would be beneficial to many students due to the increase of responsibility, lack of distractions, and flexibility it provides.        ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
F407D70D45AD,"As technology advances with time, modern day students continue to benefit from more sophisticated and accessible means through which they're able to study their courses of interest. With a greater number of sources springing up, such as Khan Academy and IXL, more and more adolescents suddenly have the option of learning from the comforts of their homes, with videos and activities ripe with content on par with regular schoolwork. With this influx of greater educational opportunities, isn't it due time we integrate this concept into our day to day schools? The use of online classes and video conferencing for schools will greatly benefit absent and sickly students and allow for a more personalized, direct method of teaching.

The ability to take classes from home would directly benefit absent students, as well as sick students that aren't able to attend school any given day. The issue with sickness - and, particularly, with the flu season - is the increasing number of absent students that are forced to skip out on classes. As if their lives aren't busy enough already, they now have the responsibility of catching up on missed work and unfinished notes. Schools have already tried numerous contraceptives to this issue, from sending home work for the student to complete or force them to attend class if their sickness isn't severe; however, those options suffer the risk of getting other students sick, or having the sick student obtain a poor understanding of the subject at hand due to their illness. Being able to take the class at home would allow the teacher to teach that student at the same level as he could achieve in class, even if they aren't physically present. It would eliminate any confusion and risk of exposing other children to the sickness, benefiting both the absentee and the school faculty.

Another benefit of being taught from home is a more direct, eye-to-eye method of teaching that would greatly help a number of students. Schools have been evolving in the recent years to accommodate a plethora of children with varying needs, and thus far, it's been a successful endeavor. Those that perform poorly in a group setting are far more likely to succeed in their classes if they had the opportunity to access education from a familiar setting in an individual, one on one sort of education. In my previous school, for example, I had a friend that I seldom saw in school. In the rare moments I did see him, he always appeared reclusive and unwilling to study. Whenever I questioned my teachers about him, however, they'd assure me that he was performing consistently well in his classes, most of which he took from his home during school hours. Prior to the year I moved, he'd become far more outgoing and showed up more often at school. Not all of us study the same way, and likewise can be said for those that require a different type of teaching to excel as learners.

As much potential as these sorts of classes might have, some people argue that they're infinitely far less interactive than attending them physically. With the rising amount of research and development, however, this might soon cease to be an issue. Even with technological restraints, educators have made incredible strides to make at-home classes inclusive and productive. Videos explaining complex subjects now often come with worksheets, quizzes, web quests, or other innovative projects. The quality of these lessons come mostly from the teachers, too: a tangible subject such as art has been made into a comprehensive learning experience with people such as Bob Ross and his show or the Khan Academy website, with Salmar Khan's initiative fueling a decade of innovative learning. With the further advancement in technology, it's not unlikely that we'll soon have fully fledged, big scale projects with the help of computers or virtual reality. Such a dated argument has been unwoven at an unprecedented rate over the past few years.

As technology has evolved, so must our schools. From blackboards to smart boards and to chromebooks, we must continue to incorporate this tech into our lessons to further the learning of the generations soon to come. Students that are ill or have other needs shall have what helps them stay productive and successful in the present day. At the pace we've been going, who knows what'll come next? Whatever it may be, we've got push forward and keep advancing the educational experiences of those that will power our future.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
5E47B63AEE2A,"Students have a higher chance of catching a virus during school hours. Viruses could easily spread to others by touching or any other types of physical interactions. It's not easy to cure a virus and some viruses could be deadly, like the Coronavirus. A lot of people, mostly students in Wuhan, China are getting this virus and most of them claim it spread through physical interaction. The virus is spreading quickly and now we have many cases and few deaths in the U.S. Even though it is very important to be interacting with other students when you are in school, a single touch could possibly harm you. Some people believe that distance learning is not beneficial since students need to interact with others; However, being able to attend classes from home is a huge advantage and a good way for students to avoid catching any type of virus.

Many schools offer distance learning only for students who needs it. Some schools offer it as an option for students who wants to attend classes from home. Students can easily attend school classes either online or by video conferencing. One of the advantages of distance learning is that, students are not going to wait on their buses early in the morning when its cold, foggy, and rainy. Instead, they will be sitting at home feeling cozy and safe while doing their school work. However, in winter, when students enter the school building it's usually very warm and when they leave it's really cold outside so they end up catching a cold. That leads to parents having to spend money and take their children to the hospital. In the hospital there are many sick people around so students could catch viruses easily. Distance learning could also help parents save up money and not having to worry about taking their kids to the hospital because students are less likely to get sick and catch a cold when they are at home.

Since the Coronavirus is made out of many different viruses and germs joined together, being outside when its cold or being around many students could be dangerous. One way for students to prevent themselves from catching this virus is by washing their hands all the time. because this virus could also spread through droplets when coughing or sneezing. Students always forget to wash their hands after they cough and when they touch other students they spread germs. Parents, however, are always reminding their children to wash their hands before doing anything. When students attend classes from home they are spending more time with their parents. Therefore, students will always be reminded to wash their hands. That way they will be safe and prevented from catching or spreading any germs.

In conclusion, distance learning or attending classes from home is a beneficial advantage for students to look forward into. It's not only a good way to protect students from catching or spreading deadly viruses, It will also help parents spend less money when it comes to hospital bills and school supplies such as backpacks and books. Also Students are going to be around their family and pets which means they are going to feel more happy doing their school work. They are not going to sit around watching the clock waiting to go home because they are going to be already home. By staying home and attending classes at home, students aren't going to be catching diseases and then spreading to other people. Clearly, they aren't going to be harmed or harm people. Distance learning is the best start that that will take us to the solution to those deadly problems.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Less than a couple decades ago, all students were either going to an actual school building or were being homeschooled. In both of these environments, students had to use textbooks to learn the subjects and a notebook to study the notes you wrote on the subject. Now almost all the information the world has to offer is at the palm of our hand. Technology has developed so rapidly in the recent years that students are able to complete classes and even get a degree just by having a computer and internet access. Taking classes online from home is exactly the same as taking classes at a school, but students who take their classes online at home are able to have less distractions getting in the way of their learning.

In almost every class at a school, assignments and tests are taken on a computer. This being said, online classes taken from home and video lectures are really no different from what is going on inside a classroom, but they do have one big difference. At any school, there is always going to be drama. There is always going to be teachers that you fall half asleep during their lectures. There will also always be the chatter of your peers while in a classroom too. The big benifit of the students taking their classes from home is that they will be in their own comfortable environment. There are not any other students making lots of noise. Most of the time there isn't really a teacher actually teaching students the lesson, rather students will read the information to themselves, making them have to focus on the subject at hand. Students will most likely be able to concentrate more deeply on their learning and be free from the distracting school environment. This gives the students at home more potential to retain information and have a greater understanding of different concepts than the students who attend a school. Students taking classes at home would also be abe to benifit because they can take the classes at their own pace. In most schools, some teachers just talk way too fast or way too slow; Sometimes students can not even comprehend the teacher's hand writing. With having all the information right on a computer, students are able to choose whatever pace is necessary for them to learn the information in their classes. As a result of the flexible time, most students will have the information stay in their heads, making tests and quizzes a lot easier to finish in a short amount of time.

In conclusion, online classes can help students who get distracted easily by the traditional school environment. It also gives the students more potential to have deep understandings of material due to having a flexible learning schedual.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
EACEDA8DD189,"Would you like to know if

I agree with the schools that offer the student to recieve classes from their homes?. First I would like to explain some of my thoughts. Is a lot things that benefit this option. For example, you do not have to ride the bus because nobody like being in the bus also when is cold and you are out side waiting for the bus is not really good , also peaople do not know how to drive a car drive or do not have a car that they can use this option will be a lot of help for them.

I believe this option will benefit a lot of student because if we stay home studying we do not have to go out because we all know that our mothers do not like when treir sons are in the street. Also i think we will have less time to study so we can work more. Because some student get out of the school because they want money so they preffer work all day long . However not all student make that decision but the student who make it I think it is beacuse they do not have their parents or any family member that suppot him or her. Also some student still come but they do not do their best in class beacuse they have not sleep the suffecient. And sometimes for this reason students decide to not come because they need and want to sleep and some teachers do not understand them and wake them up.

Another reason that all the school should put this law is bacause students do not get out of school only to go work sometimes student don't come anymore because some of the teachers have not an amazing personality. for example, they always are mad at you , don't let us to use the bathrooms and sometimes we really really need to use it this is one of the alot of reasons that you should let the student attend to classes from our home.

However sometimes students want to study but they can not. beacuse like I said it first they do not have anyone to support them in some cases even their parents obligate them to left the school to go to work because they do not want to pay all the things for him or her so they have make money for themselves. Otherwise if all schools do this all student can recieve classes and we all can have a nice job and a great future for us and our family. In my opinon this option is very important for all of us. Because if all student study we will make this country and this world amazing.

Finally in conclusion I think this option is the best choose that all school can make because all people deserve to recieve eduaction and have the opportunity to be professional in this life. And also I think that if all school make this in reality all people will love this country more than they do. So I invite all you to make is posible because a lot of people need your help to recive classes and make our dreams true.                                                                                     ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
EA532C0ED925,"Online school does not come with many developmental benefits. It is only a good options for people who are in college who have a job or other commitments. While we are still maturing we need to learn how to work with others and communicate because those are very important life skills. Online school or video conferencing allows people do to their work from their own home without having to communicate with others. Online school is only a good option if it is hard for you to physically to get there. For example, if you are unwell or have a disability that needs assistance and care then online school is the better option. Students don't benefit from taking classes at home because the lack of the social aspect, and they don't get to utilize school resources.

Making friends is already hard as it is for most people, especially if you are not even at school. Making friends teaches you how to maintain valuable relationships and important communication skills. Students who do online school for most of their lives will lack social skills needed in every day life. Students who choose online school are also trying to keep their distance from school, for the most part. This means they will miss out on school sponsored events and/or sports. For many students, sports and clubs are their passions and if one chooses online school they might miss out on a great opportunity that could benefit them. Students who choose to learn from home will also lack group work skills which is extremely important, even If they don't want a job that involves group settings, it is important to learn how to communicate with others and meet halfway. The social aspect of physically going to school is too important to not take into account.

Schools offer great resources for students to use during school hours. For example, many schools offer a math tutoring center for kids who need extra help/ explaining on their homework. They also could offer help on other subjects, these are great resources which many students use during their study hall block. All schools also have a type of counseling system which can help students plan for college, talk about certain issues they might be having, or plan for the next year. Counselors are very important to have nearby in case you have a question or an issue you want to talk to them about. The library is also a great resource that students who learn from home won't have readily available. The library is a great place to work, research, and find new books. Students who choose to learn from home won't have these benefits easily accessible.

Attending school comes with more benefits than attending school from home. The only way online school would be a benefit is if the student is disabled and needs care. Schools also add structure into our lives by waking up five days a week and working for around seven hours a day. If ones chooses to do online school they could wake up whenever they wanted and they would not have structure. Students who don't attend school can also be bullied or labeled as abnormal when they are older if they lack social skills, and they could also possibly be denied from jobs too. In conclusion students do not benefit from attending classes from home because the lack of the social aspect, and they don't get to utilize school resources.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3E22E1F1A48C,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Nowadays schools are starting to use technology more and are letting students take more online classes. Some people believe that students would not be able to attend classes from home because they would have no one one time with a teacher and they would not be able to make up work if they miss anything. Although some believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

Students can have academic benefits if they take online classes. Firstly, students would learn time management. for example, if an assignment is due at midnight they would have to make sure it gets done. This could help them keep steady grades because the assignments would be turned in on time. Secondly, students would learn responsibility. For example, if they had work due in two days they would make sure it gets done within the two days because they know that they are responsible for doing the work and turning it in. Students would do the work because they know that they are responsible for their grades and the work that is due. Finally, it could potentially make them harder workers. For example, if a student is doing an online course and they get stuck on something they would not be able to get the immediate help from a teacher like they would if they were in a regular classroom setting, they would have to work harder and think more because they have less help. This shows why students would work harder and by them doing that they could have good grades.

Students could also have health benefits from attending classes from home. Firstly, students would be less stressed. For example. if they were in a regular classroom setting and they had work due by the end of that class period they would be in a rush and start to stress because they are limited on a short amount of time. This shows how online classes could be less stressful because students would not feel as rushed to complete the work. Secondly, students could sleep in a little longer which would give them more energy while they do the online work. For example, say schools started at seven in the morning and students had to wake up at six in the morning to get ready for school, when they first arrive they go straight to sleep and miss out on instruction and work. This shows how being able to have online classes is beneficial to students. Lastly, they would be more calm while doing the work. For example, if a student is at home doing online classes away from others they would be more calm and focused. This shows hoe students can benefit from attending online classes.

Although some believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes fro home, it should be known that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some people believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they have no real instruction and it could be less productive. Students would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home academic wise and as well as health wise. Schools should allow students to take more online classes over time because it could benefit students in a lot of different ways.  ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5C69070E1E48,"Students would benefit and not benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because you can stay at home ,not distraction,not friends or groups,tools from school that you may need,students can cheat.

Students would benefit from being able to attend school from home because you can stay at home and by staying at home you can wake up late for school. There is some students that hate waking up early for school that's one of the reasons of having the opportunity to take your classes in online. Staying at home you can be eating whatever you want there is not going to be teachers telling you that you can't eat. There might be people that doesn't have the transportation to go school and get in time for school and because children doesn't like waking 6 AM in the morning. That chance to take classes at online many students would prefer having online classes.

Other reason why students would benefit by attending classes from home is because there is not distraction at your home you can be at your room alone without no one to distract you when you're taking your classes or when you're taking a very important test. By being alone at home you can concentrate more about the things that you're learning because your friends are not there with you to distract you with another things.

Like I said there is not benefit too of having classes in online because students doesn't have friends or a group of friends to share their ideas. There is children that may need a group or a friend to talk about their ideas in classes or maybe you have a problem with something and you don't have no one to help you ,and by having not classmate it might be boring being alone.

students may need tools from school for example you need to read a book and you don't have one because you just don't own books at home and that's why I think it would not benefit because in school you have a library you can go there to find a book and there is different types of books students can pick.

Other reason why it would not benefit the students is because they can cheat.

students can cheat at everything because you don't have a teacher that is taking care that the student don't cheat at a test. If the students doesn't want to do a class he can can pay someone to make it for then ad pass it for them.

Different people might have another opinion about taking classes at home but I think there is benefit and not benefit because students can use this opportunity to waste their time or take advantages about having classes at home. In my opinion there will be some students that will take this serious and do the right thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
AA40C0B9B536,"Many kids that attend school today have school work that they have to do online, with everything moving toward the internet their is not that many things students around the globe still do that is paper copy. Their is many pros and cons when attending class online from home. I think that it would be more beneficial attending class from school instead of taking it from home.

While taking online classes their will be things you don't understand but since you dont have the guides you need to problem solve. You have to continue without understand the concept , but if you were attending the class you could ask the teacher for assents to explain something to help you understand what it is you have to do. One of the class it would be beneficial is in math. With attending the class it would be easier to ask for help since there is many ways you can solve problem in math. But with attending it from home you would have to watch the video over again hoping you would you understand the way their teaching it.

Another way attending the class is more beneficial than taking it online is if your taking a class that involves a lot of hands on and physical work you will not see how it feels to really do something. Instead you will have simulations of activities ,but with attending you would have the real experiments from doing it in person. While doing online classes the videos that you have to watch may not be everything you might see while learning. For example welding with welding it is best that you attend that class because it is a lot of thing you will go thought.

Finally attending classes would be more beneficial because you get to have human interaction with other people instead, of watching videos you can learn thing that you may not learn from the videos. With online class you don't get to see other peoples point of view and see how they may enter pt things differently. Also with attending class your have some their to watch and help you strive to complete your working instead of you moving slow never completing work.

While taking online course has you moving at your own pace it lacks you getting the extra help you may need when working. Therefore thats why I find attending the class more beneficial than taking online classes.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
72765D1D4721,"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.

Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.

My final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.

In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes.                           ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
8A2979AB26BE,"The idea of online school sounds like a dream to any student in the world. When students hear about online school they think you only do a little bit of school work and that you get to do other things that doesnt involve school. In reality, online school is suppose to be the same thing as going to school but your not physically at school, instead you are learning on a computer. I think the option for students to attend classes online from home would not be beneficial to students. Doing online school at home can be very distracting and this doesn't give students the experience of social interaction with other students.

First reason why I dont think online school would benefit students is that homes aren't a place where students can focus. When students at a young age are home they aren't as focused like they are in school. There are electronics in homes that can be a huge distraction to students. For example, televisions, phones, and even video games can all be things that keep students from focusing on their school work. When students are home and not doing anything, they will use their electronic devices as a source of entertainment. Electronics can also lead to cheating, if students use their phones they could easily look up the answers online. This keeps them from learning their school material and not develop the skills they need for that class. Another distraction at home that can keep students from focusing on their school work is their parents. Say if a student has a stay at home parent or a parent that works from home then their parents could get in the way of their school work. The parents of these students taking the online school could help them with their classwork or even homework. Sometimes parents think helping your child out is giving them the answers and having them not do any of the work. This doesn't allow students to learn about the classwork their teacher is giving them and letting them take the easy way out of doing it.

Second reason why I disagree with online school is that this can isolate students which also doesn't benefit them. When you take an online school, the whole idea is that you arent going to a school building and sitting in a classroom with other students. I think this isn't okay because this can make young students not develop the skills of talking to others. Talking to people is what we do everyday, schools actually help you with this considering you are in a building full of people who aren't related to you and who you don't know. If students take online school classes then they won't be able to learn how to make friends or how to ask questions when needing help. This can lead to students becoming socially awkward with others or not know how to fit in with a group of students their age.

Now on the other hand other people might agree with the idea of online school for students. They would say how it would benefit students who have any social anxieties or anything that involves them not being able to go to school. One example why online school can benefit students is that it can be very helpful to students who have social anxieties. Social anxieties can be hard to deal with when the student who has it is in a new environment surrounded by people they don't know. If there was a student who deals with social anxiety problems then online school would be the better choice for them. They can take their classes at home and not have any problems that would get in the way of their learning. Students who can't come to school for any reason is another example of why online school could benefit students. Some students might travel with their family three weeks to a month and won't be able to attend school. Thats why online school is perfect for them considering they don't have to be in a classroom and can do it online wherever they are. Other students also might not be able to attend school because they want to pursue in an activity or a job that doesn't allow them to go to school. For example, dance academy is really big for ballerinas and dancers who want to pursue in that field. If a student wants to go to dance academy, most of the time their academy will have them dance all day. As a result to that, it leads students not be able to attend school and only have them focus on dance. This is why online school could benefit students who aren't able to physically go to school.

In summary, students would not get more benefits from taking online classes since they can lead to no interaction with others and will be hard for students to stay focus on their work if they aren't in an environment where they can focus. Online school is only good for students who actually need it, going to school is a lot better than taking it online. When you go to school it gives you more opportunities to get help and you get to be surrounded by other students who can also help you. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DB3A6CE1E72C,"Education is one of the greatest offers we have, as well as an important asset to have obtained. There are many ways to achieve one; as well as multiple places to go and get an education. Most students go to a school for an education, but now there are more options. Another unique form to get an education is online classes from home. I believe classes from home can be a great option that can benefit many students.

Online classes, or classes from home can help many students such as students with a learning disability, or special conditions, as well as disorders. Students with a disability, or disorder who cannot leave home, or need special care; can get their education at home while remaining comfortable. Classes at home allow these students to get the care they need, while still learning and progressing in school. Since the online classes include video conferencing; if some of these students, or students in general need Verbal explanations or help, then they will receive the help they need even in their home.

One of the major benefits of classes at home is having them at home. Students' ability to learn can vary by location, and setting. Many students do not feel comfortable in a classroom environment, or are incapable of learning in a classroom space. By having the classes at home; students who have anxiety, or struggle with any other problems will not have as much as a struggle or concern as they would in class. This benefits these students, because by being at home and feeling more comfortable, and at ease they can focus more on the school work. However, there are students who struggle to keep up in a classroom, and by having these classes at home they can go at their own pace; and receive the further explanation they need.

The biggest benefit of having online classes available, is that there is always a way to get an education. If a student or students have good reasoning to have to do online school or if they are required to, then it is available to them. Their biggest benefit is that it is an option for a requirement that is a big part of their life which is an education. Online classes can also be to help students who move quickly instead of slowly, if some students want to do extra classes as well as attending school to graduate early or have extra curricular classes to add to their college applications.

Overall, i believe that classes from home can be very beneficial, and can help students succeed further in school, as well as with achieving the education they desire. It is a great option that provides a different take on the normal school education and school scene. It can be the help that some students do not have or are not provided in school, which can lead to many benefits and success' in students lives.                                ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
FDD81292D8A4,"Has there ever been a day where going to school just wasn't an option and got a ton of makeup work? All of that makeup work can be resolved with providing students the option to take class at home. Although some may believe otherwise having class as a at home option truly benefits the students because they learn better in their own environment, sick students can still attend class, and when an unexpected closing occurs class can still go on.

My First reasoning to why students should be allowed to take class at home is that students tend to learn better in their own environment. Working at home is a more efficient way to get things done because work can be completed on an individuals own time. For example this summer I took an Econ class, being a requirement to graduate I was obligated to take it. Instead of taking the class during the school year I opted for the summer providing me with lots of time to complete the class and getting the class done in a shorter amount of time. Some may say students will just get distracted or look answers up online but, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that if they are in their own home less distractions like classmates or classroom activities will occur. Hannah Meloche, a famous youtuber, completes her school work at home. Learning on her own time and excelling in her classes online benefit her in so many ways. She now has traveled the world and runs a million dollar company all while still being in school and learning more than she does in a school day. These opportunities would have not been an option if it wasnt for online school. Creating more opportunities, online school benefits the student in being able to succeed outside of the classroom

Second, if a student wakes up sick or has another reason why they can't make it to school it is easy for them to still attend class and get their work done. Lots of students get sick during the school year and have to miss school because of it. This year eleven out of the twenty-three kids in my class were out sick because of the flu. My teacher had to stop teaching because she didnt want the other students to get far behind in work. This issue can be resolved with the online class option. People may argue that students will just fake sick just to stay home in affect increase the amount of student absences. While that is false because students will still get credited for attendance if they show up online to class and get their work done which will actually decrease the absence amount.

Famous actress Millie Bobby Brown, has no time for school while being in many TV shows and movies. Being able to take her classes on set while still getting credit allow her to star in award winning movies. She still learns all the same curriculum that everyone else does and puts in the same amount of work.

Attending class online when a student can't make it in, benefits the student in being able to still learn the subject while outside of the classroom.

Lastly, students who live in areas with harsh weather conditions sometimes have days where school has to close down. Snow days, heat days and even wind days can all affect the school work getting done by a student. When snow days occur in my area teachers usually hold class that morning to still get our work done and stay on track during the school year. Once my math teacher held a three hour math class on a snow day morning to keep everyone from forgetting the subject. With that some might state that students would choose not to do it or miss the class. All work is still up for a grade and those students will need to complete it. In 2009, the east coast of the U.S. had a huge snow storm closing down school for two weeks. Students fell really far behind on their school work and had to rush to learn everything when they got back. If schools provided online school everyone would have stayed on track and could learn at their own pace. Having weather affect the students learning, online school benefits the students in learning even when school is not open.

In conclusion students will benefit from this tremendously and be able to keep on track of their work. Getting work done on their own time and keeping their grades up each and every student will be able to learn better.

Although some may believe otherwise having class as a at home option truly benefits the students because they learn better in their own environment, sick students can still attend class, and when an unexpected closing occurs class can still go on. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9168DF355F2F,"in this paper l would argument about student's that should not be able to attend class from home.

Student should not be able to attend class from home,because some student they don't have benefit by taking class online,because some of the student get frustrate in some occasion when they don't understand something,

Student that attend class in school are more concentrate in school and they have their mind already awake.

student they can't have more benefit by attending at school, because they can't communicated with others student or ask questions to their teachers, help student to get better in school would get student to be more active in school ,and they would be able to finish they work at the time.

Some said that take class online will help student's to be more better, but they are wrong ,because if student take class in school they would get more benefit, like help from the teacher when they don't understand the subject .

However students they have more space in school to think and choose what student wante to do to demonstrated that student they dont need to take class online for the reason that they need to be more awake depending on taking class at school.

196E73AAF08F,"Have you ever imagined how schools will be like in 100 years or how people will get their education 100 years from now?

It will most likely be the same way as right now, the same style we've been using long before 100 years ago. The education system hasn't changed a lot since my parents have gone to school or since their parents have gone to school. All schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people say students will not benefit from learning at home but they will benefit because they are less likely to get distracted by friends or classmates, it helps students learn in an environment where they feel more comfortable and confident, and students can learn more because it's at their pace and they can get one on one help.

Students are less likely to get distracted by friends or classmates if the school offers distance learning as an option for students because it will be just the student and he or she won't have any friends to waste time with. When I was in 3rd grade I had a lot of friends in my class and we would just mess around with each other and have fun instead of learning. My grades that year dropped I never payed attention in class because all my focus was on my friends. The next year I was in class with none of my friends and I did a lot better, my grades were good and I was doing good on tests and projects. Everything was great, but there was one problem in the second semester I sat next to the most disrespectful and annoying kid ever, he was a big distraction that would not stop talking and I could not learn.

Students will learn in an environment where they feel more comfortable and confident, at home I do not have to worry about being judged or made fun of. I feel like I have more confidence when I am at home and a recent Stanford study shows that students learn and understand 15% more informantion when they are in a postive mindset and environment. I don't have to worry about getting into drama or someone trying to bother me.

When students learn at home they learn more because it's at their pace and they can get one on one help. During class sometimes the teachers goes through the lesson fast and there are some things I am unclear about because everyone learns at different paces and I am scared of asking becasue I feel everyone is gonna think I am dumb. When I don't ask my question during the class I make sure to ask after school and get some extra help. If students learn at home and get taught by video conferencing there is no need for students like me to spend time after school because it is one on one and you can just ask the question there without the fear of judgement.

While some people might say students shouldn't be given the option to learn at home because they can cheat and will not be productive; however, they will benefit because they are less likely to get distracted by friends or classmates, it helps students learn in an environment where they feel more comfortable and confident, and students can learn more because it's at their pace and they can get one on one help. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
3C693CBFEFB5,"Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited them in whatever situation They're in right now.

Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences, prodcasts i've watched on the radio, and from hearing some celebrities talk.

One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. she's struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""it's so crazy""

because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer.

Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure. That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others.

Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . One i've heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, it's just him and his laptop there's no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that, but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.

Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial it was to them. There's this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in people's mouth. Generic_Name has said that she's been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again.

The importance is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial for them. In the future people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how it's like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media It's hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
F368BBECCCD1,"Imagine you are a Highschool student struggling to keep up with the work in all of your classes, with online school you can work at your own pace and be able to get better grades or maybe you have a job that requires you to be there during part of a school day. Those are just some of the many reasons I believe how students can benefit from online school.

Some people believe that kids do not benefit from online school, for example, the kids can't get actual help from a teacher who is normally present during regular school. This is important because some kids learn differelntly than others and may need that extra help from a teacher but some online courses may not have that option.

Online school can be very beneficial for students in high school and college students who have jobs to where they cant attend school for a full day, for instance, I have a friend who gets paid to play video games and so he does his school online and he can complete it at his conveinience and still get a degree. This is important because it gives the student a chance to learn and be able to accomplish other things at the same time.

Students who have a difficult time keeping up with the work in the classroom can also benefit from online school because they can complete the tasks at their own pace, for example, I have a hard time keeping up with the pace of my math class and believe that if I were to be able to learn the material at my own pace I would be doing a lot better in that class. This is the case for most students in highschool, they have a class that they are stuggling to keep up with and because of it they aren't doing as well as they could.

In conclusion, for the reasons listed above, I believe that students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home, school can be difficult, especially when there are other things going on in your life.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
6565F5930D6E,"Have you ever wonder what it is like attend classes from home well let me tell you. Attend class at home is very cool in a way that u can a lot of stuff done and still be at home.75% of scientists say that attending school from home is very good for your health

I think school should let students attend class from home because it gives the students no distraction and the students are going to get the work and stuff more. For example I was a wacthing movie about this girl and she hated going to school and she didn't get along with the other students. She was there prey and the kids where the predators because they always bullied her because of her skin tone and her grades were not that good she had all f's. So one morning the parents decided to ask the teacher can she attend class from home and the teacher said yes so they started the next day and it turned out good because the girl was not getting bullied no more and her grades was looking good. This shows that attending classes from home is a good idea for your kids because it going to help your kids get her grades up and the kids wont get bullied.

Some people think that students shouldn't attend class for home because people say that the kids are not going to do there work and they are going to be playing there video games and not pay attention. However they are wrong because students are going to do there work and they are going to get a more better understanding of there work. For instance,I watched this TV show and this boy through attending class from school was dumb,but this boy that I was watching he got bad grade to and the was bully, and so the parents of this boy was thinking about letting his son attend school from home but the boy didnt won't to do that. As week go by the parents finally, got there son to attend class from about a week later the parents was satisfied with the results. The boy was getting his work done and his grades were awesome and the parents were so happy that they made that move.

If you just let your child attend class from home you would be a happy parents and you would see a major difference if u just let your child attend class from school .I just feel like attending class from home is a better way to get a understanding of the work and it will help you In the long run. If u just listen to me the world would be a better place and kids well do better in school ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B7E98C5C578F,"Most High schools in Generic_City offer an online school program either during the summer or the school year. Some students take online courses in the summer to get rid of a required elective. However most of these students who take an online course at some point should consider the pros and cons of this decision. That is due to the fact that students benefit more from a physical school than an online school because students encode more information through varying teaching styles, a physical schools helps build strong relationships, and a physical school allows for one to express creativity.

The first reason why students benefit more from an actual school than a online school is; Online schools offer a very limited ways of teaching a subject. Whereas an Actual teacher can help you learn a certain in various ways to help understand that topic to the fullest. Whether that be doing a project, Homework, Notes, etc.

The online school usually go through notes or modules then assign you homework and tests. along with limitation of teaching styles this also prevents from a students figuring out the best way he or she learns something. For example say you had a history teacher who only read from the textbook and made you copy notes. On the other hand you had another teacher who taught notes not just through textbooks but through web quest, group class work and videos. Pretty quickly you as student would know which type of teaching style you like; a more hands on approach to learning or just straight memorization of a textbook. Online school don't provides this, it follow a strict circumluem and guide lines with no lean way from perceive that differ from their own.

This brings me to the next point which is online schools with their limited interaction prevents the students from building a connection with their teacher. Without a strong connection to your teacher there isnt a incentive to put your best work forward. Or even for you to reconcile with a teacher on why you didn't your best work forward.

Furthermore without this connection the online course will be unable to assess if the students is just trying to pass or are they have full attention in this class. The other aspects of lack of relationships in online schools is peers. Without peers at school a students won't be exposed to ideas and interests, plus this can lead to problems down the road. These problems relating to anxiety ,seclusion, and even depression.

The final reasons which ties in with the other reasons is. With this limited interactions and set structured circumluem. there very little room for a student to express his or her self creativity. Whether that be through projects, answers to a philosophical questions, etc. With prevention of creativity this cause students be able to understand what their role in society is with always being insecure and looking for resurgence. Losing the confidence to think out side of box is harmful to their life after school. With employers today looking for the not just intellects but also signs of creativity to help innovate the businesses even further.

In conclusion, student gain more knowledge in physical school than online school because students process information better through multiple teaching styles, schools help grow and blossom long term relationships , and schools allow for one to express themselves artistically. Some might argue that online schools are beneficial to graduate early however the benefits are outweighed by the cons listed above. All children are required to go to school not just to be educated but also how to act in society. Without schools the world would a lot less advance and civilized ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
796911DBD5C2,"Do you ever get tired of having to wake up so early every single morning, so you wouldnt be late for class? Being able to attend your classes from home, by taking them online or participating in class but through vidoechat will give you that option of getting up and catching the bus so you will be on time for class or to staying comfortable in your bed and still being all caught up on all the school assignments. Students should be able to catch up on any work missed or missing from any of their classes without having to stay after school or come during a free period to make up that work. So being able to do it online would encourage them to stay caught up more, especailly if that means they dont have to leave their beds or stay after school hours to complete make up work.

Firstly having the sight of knowing you can easily catch up on anything that would of been missed in class since they were not able to make it then being able to make up those things online can lift so much weight off your shoulders. Worrying about waking up early so they wouldnt be late is unnecesary because they dont have to be at the school to finish or start the assignments needed they werent there to do with the rest of the class. For example if they were to miss the bus, and couldn't get a ride to school instead of just being absent and becoming very behind in the school work they woud be able to stay home and complete any missing assigments so by the time they were to get back to that class they would be all caught up and wouldnt have to worry abut finding another time including their free time to make those things up. This helps shows how much more convient using the technalogy to help us complete assignments can become very useful if students were allowed to attend classes online if there were a reason of being absent.

My second reason why scholars should be able to participate in classes from home, is they wouldnt have to stress about attendence or being marked absent or missing the lesson which wouldnt put them behind in their assignments because there would be access to everthing one would need to stay on task and caught up on the computer. For instance missing one math class always makes you feel like you have been gone for a week so you tend to fall behind and become very confused in the lessons but if there were a way they could complete or make up everything that was missed or be able to learn the lesson that wasnt learned because of their absence like the video chat or online assignments or even a replay of the lesson then they would be able to catch up to schedule and also have a better understandment of the lesson that was missed. Therefor having these online classes as an option can be very helpful and can make being a succesful scholar not easier but more efficant and requires less of your energy, helps takes away just a little bit of the extraness highschool tends to bring especially when it comes to grades and assignments.

My third reason is being able to stay home and attend to everything needed at the touch of a finger tip comes in handy when you really dislike or dont get along with the people you're required to be around in school whether it's the students or the teachers, because not only do they not have to see any of them but they dont have to interact or even make any type of contact with anyone because they will be at home and cathcing up or maybe even ahead in all assignments that the rest of the students might be in class struggling on. Like as an example if there were a group project and one couldnt cooperate in class with the group members that same student can stay home and complete whatever part of the group assignment that they couldnt seem to complete with the partner, because some people just might work better independently. This helps convey how much easier staying up to task and completing all school assignments could or can become if there was an option of being able to catch up from home without falling behind.

Some would say that since they are not required to show up and they know for a fact attendence isnt a problem and being behind in late work is also not an issue, this can also encourage more students to not want to actually attend school. Knowing that not being present isnt going to make a difference and or effect grades gives you just another reason to stay right in bed after the alarm goes off for you to get up. For instance having the note in the back of your head that it is not a requirment to attend or even be in the building kids are most likely going to take advantage and stay home even if they arent catching up becuase just having the knowledge that they can be caught up in no time makes classes less of a priority. This explains how easy having the online classes would make it for students to skip and or be lazy with their school deadlines. But most say that being able to make up everything that has been missed can also encourage the people and students to want to be in school more so they wont have to worry about catchig up at home on the online classes, it can cause them to want to finsih eveything in class so there would be no reason for make ups.

In conculsion from a students perspective being able to complete assignments like classwork, homework, and maybe even quizes or test can benefit more than enough people, and can become not just another but a more efficant way of highschools that requires less work and effort which results in so much more less stress and gives you energy to focus on other important things others might have going on in life like jobs, and sports, and family. Kids wouldnt have to wake up so ealry every moring, they wouldnt have to stress about attendence because it wouldnt be a requirment to be there and if they dislike the enviorment they wont even have to step foot on school property and will still graduate at the same time as their class. Which helps show how much more effcant and less stressful online classes can make our education.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
57E8161AEF27,"I think It's a really good idea, And students they will benefit with this idea, Bacuse they don't have to travel to school eveyday, it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing because is soo much easier. And i think is more beneficial beacuse i dont think, Students would want to travel eveyday to school and back.

I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school eveyday. It will be so much easier taking classes only, because students will have more free time to do their own things, after they're done with all their schoolo work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time to work.

Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, It's because students they don't have to worry, about gettig in trauble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school schoool, there will be a high posibility of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be for many reasons; for example: traffict issus, parents they might get sick or any other reason, It will be really hard for this students if schools wouldn't offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for this students who aren't able to come to school, Myself as student i think this is a really good idea made by the school, Bacuse it gives students the oportnity of study at home when they aren't caplable to show up to school for this type of reasons.

I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students don't have the ability as others students, That has the oportunity of riding the bus to school everyday from Monday to Friday, This students who takes online classes is because they really need it, And they don't have a way of getting to school eveyday , It might be more difficult for them , because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school don't have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they don't have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they won't be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students don't live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
9C82C0E4B743,"School can either be the best or the worst option for some students because everyone is different. Students have different strong suites like someone can be good at more hands on work and others might be more gifted when it comes to more memorization based tasks. Schools have changed throughout the years and have become more advanced. This advanced technology has made it more beneficial for students who wish to separate themselves from the school environment and complete their education at home. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it's better for your mental health, allows more flexibility, and students can perform better overall.

Mental health is a major issue that has been talked about for years. It's a very common topic that comes up when talking about teens because teens seem to take on a lot and don't know how to manage everything well at a young age. It can be really challenging battling with mental issues. School can trigger students mental health because of the workload, negative environment, and the people they surround themselves with. Coming to school can get repetitive and often can make students feel trapped. Being surrounded by an environment that is familiar to students can help them significantly by allowing them to work freely and at their own pace without any negativity. I have struggled with mental health my whole life and it only got worse in eighth grade. That summer I had gotten into a car accident and badly injured my back. I was told I needed surgery and that I would be missing the rest of the school year. I was worried about all my school work and I had so many questions. My mental health took a big hit and I became even more depressed. When I got out of surgery I was told that I would need to stay at the hospital for a couple days. Once I was discharged it became very difficult for me to return back to normal. I struggled to walk, sleep, and take care of myself. Once I started recovering I was able to focus on school more. I was happy I didn't have to physically attend school because school had made me depressed. It was nice to get away from such a negative environment and start fresh. I started doing school online and felt that staying home really helped with my mental health. I started interacting with others after months of not interacting. I started hanging out with my friends and became happier. Doing my work at home allowed me to focus more and do everything I would do at school in the comfort of my own home.

Often times students don't get enough time to do what they would like because their time is being occupied by school. School takes up seven hours of a student's day and some students do extracurricular activities after school which only takes up more time. Doing school online however, allows you to be more flexible. Many youtubers have taken the online school route because they would like to further their careers and attending school physically wouldn't allow them to do that. A video creator on Youtube named, Antonio Garza, decided to pursue school online so she could further her Youtube career. She has mentioned in her recent Youtube videos that doing school online has made it much easier to incorporate more into her day and has been better for her mental health. She has gotten offers to collaborate with others and even fly out to certain events which is something she couldn't do before. She didn't know she was going to blow up on Youtube and when she did school became a negative environment for her because she got bullied by her peers. In her videos fans noticed she seemed off and she decided to address the situation. She talked being depressed and how she was getting bullied. Online school was her way out. Ever since she started doing school online she realized she was doing much better. Overall, doing school online helped her mentally and socially.

How well you perform at school is based on several factors. Attending school isn't meant for everyone because people have different goals in life. Not everyone wants to be the a doctor or a lawyer. In school it can be hard to focus on grades because students can get distracted and become more invested into making new friends or becoming popular which causes performance to decline in school. One of my friends was new to the county and she had trouble adjusting to the new school environment. She had excellent grades at her old school and her teachers spoke highly of her. I started talking to her and we became super close.

We had built a strong relationship that I thought would last forever but I was wrong. I started noticing that she became more distant when she started dating her boyfriend. She started hanging out with the wrong group of people and stopped worrying about her grades. She started failing all her class and her mom decided that it was better for her to do online school and get away from all the negativity. I was relived because she needed help and now she was going to get it. A couple months had passed by and I got back in contact with her. She seemed to be doing better and had told me that online school was what she needed to get back on track. She was able to bring all her grades up and gain her parents trust back. We started talking more and becoming more close. She was in a better head space mentally and she was motivated.

In conclusion, being able to do school online is a positive way for students to improve their well being. It also allows students to have more time to accomplish other tasks. Lastly, students can improve their grades. Some may argue that doing school online can hurt you in the long run but the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to online school. No matter how it's done, finishing school should be a goal for many students. Just because a different path was taken that doesn't mean that success isn't an option. Separating from a negative environment can do wonders and can help significantly in the long run.                      ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
2ED1E6441A1B,"Over the last few decades, technology has been evolving rapidly, and it has helped society in numerous ways whether it be from making transportation or communication easier. Technology has even made it possible to make the opposite corners of the world seem close, and this is mostly because of electronics allowing everyone to be able to communicate through online chatting and video conferencing. Some of the few thing it has managed to do is help companies on different side of the world form deals with each other and allow people to meet others who they would of never meet before if it wasn't for the internet and other technologies. One of the areas that technology has impacted the most is in education. Now days, notes can be put up online, so when a student is sick, they can just check their teacher's website. Also, it allows for books reports and research papers to be a lot easier to do because student no longer have to go all the libraries searching for a specific book for support on their report. They can just go online and look up some information or read e books. Technology has already taken society this far in education, but it can go another step further. School should give students the option to attend school from home because it has so many benefits such as allowing sick students or students who are away on vacation to still attend class and enable students who want to learn the same curriculum public schools teaches but have the same environment as home school does.

One of the biggest reasons student are absent from school is because of sicknesses, and this, a lot of the time, leads to students getting behind in their classes just because the student was not able to get out of bed or was contagious; however, with schools enabling their students to be able to attend class from home through online chats or video conferences it allows the students to be given another opportunity to still attend class from the comfort of their own home. In addition, students also sometimes miss school on behalf of a family emergency or vacation. Usually when a family vacation is planned, it is not a decision made by the students but rather their parent. A lot of time the vacation can last about a week or more, and ,consequently, lead to the student getting immensely behind in their classes. In some cases, it can take weeks for the students to catch up on all the work causing the student unnecessary stress. With schools allowing their student to attend class through video conference this takes preventative action from the student getting too behind in their classes.

Another great benefit of schools having an option for their students to attend classes through online chats and video conferences is providing those who like the environment of homeschooling to have the same opportunities academically as those in public school. A sufficient percentage of American students every year prefer to be home school because of the low stress environment and flexible hours. Sometimes, a students could even want to be home schooled because they have social anxiety; however, those who are home schooled are limited to whatever subjects their teacher , who is usually their parent, is able to teach. This puts them at a disadvantage because they would be missing out on opportunities to take higher level classes such as Advance placement and Duel Enrollment classes. This make them have a harder time getting accepted into college. If schools had the option for the students to attend school via the internet, this would give those who want to take challenging classes but still want to learn from home have an opportunity to be able to achieve their goals academically.

Having schools provide their students with another way to attend school will have considerable positive impacts. It allows for students to not get too behind on their work just because they were sick or on vacation, and it provides those who prefer a more relaxed environment to be able to learn public school curriculum. This can potentially lead to students doing even better in school because they are learning in an environment that suits them better. One concern schools might have is if they give this option of attending school online, would none of the students actually be physically present in school? However, that is not a concern that schools should worry about. Many student actually prefer to be physically present in school and to have a more competitive environment. Also, going to school gives the student more opportunities to see their friends too. The option of letting student attend schools online is just for those who are unable to make it or prefer a home environment in comparison to a school environment. Schools enabling their students to have this opportunity will have immense amounts of positive effects. Technology has already furthered education so far. Attending school via video conferences would be the next step to take.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
16B7CA362E71,"Some schools give students the option of taking classes from home by a way of online or a video conference call. While other students learn better in person, most students can learn easier from being in the comfort of their own home and some students like to take additional classes to gain more knowledge in a subject they struggle in. There are many different ways for students to be able to learn and gain more knowledge other than having to physically come to school.

One benefit students can have from distant learning is that students are able to learn easier and have a better learning environment from the comfort of their own home. When students have to physically go to school, it requires them to sit in a classroom that is filled with distractions and teachers expect them to concentrate and earn high scores on assignments. Instead, if the student takes online classes, it will give them a better working environment which allows the student to think in a quiet work space and allows the student to put more details into the assignment. Therefore, the student can earn a high score on the assignment. For example, a student is taking a test in class but all of his classmates around him are being very distracting and he cannot focus properly. He turned in the test and received a grade of fifty percent. If he had taken an online class and had to take a test, he would be able to earn a better score because he would be in a comfortable location where there is no one to distract him. The student would be able to concentrate and have time to think about his answer choices thoroughly. This is one reason why students should consider to take an online class.

Another benefit students can have from distant learning is gaining more knowledge. After the school year is over, during the summer, a student can take an online course if he feels that he is struggling in a certain subject. Online classes are always good to take during the summer because it is a better way to learn when school is out of session. This helps the student gain more knowledge and have a better understanding of the subject which helps the student be ahead for the following school year. For example, a student wished to take a science online course over the summer because he had a hard time in this subject. The student wanted to understand and expand his knowledge in science so he took the course and in the next school year, he was able to understand everything that his teacher taught in class. His knowledge in science was expanded and earned him a high grade in science. This was another way that students could benefit from taking an online class.

In conclusion, there are many different ways that students could benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some students should take online courses because it is easier to concentrate on an assignment when the student is in a comfortable and quiet learning environment which could be at home. Students can also take online classes to help them succeed in a subject that they have a hard time in. Overall students can benefit from taking an online course.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
64BD20F9CCC8,"What do you like more home schooling or regular schooling. Learning from home is very benefitful to have it,it gives people calm cool vibes,you can focus more also if you get sick then you have different options to keep learning also you get done with homeschooling before regular school. Even though that some people like learning from home they miss out on so much like field trips, friend's and so much more but learning from home is very benefitful and i'll tell you why.

At home there not that many distractions so more than likely you are focused on what you're doing. So when you're doing school work its just you the computer and someone whos is teaching. It's great to have the one on one with someone it helps very much and it gives another reason to stay focused. Focusing is everything when it come's to school work. Some people work a lot better when there's no one around. And the reason why i said that because a pole was set for if you worked on school work better if there was no one around vs people around. The percent came to be about 55% percent of people said they worked very well when no one was around and the other 45% said they like working on school work around people. And again it just prove's that someone people like working on school work when no one is around so doing school work at home for 55% percent of these people would give them a place to be focused.

Getting sick is one of the biggest problems with school's. When someone gets sick for a long time they so stressed when they come back to school. distance learning can solve that if there is not that bad where they can't get on a computer thats understandable. For the one that are just sick or staying home for a injuries they can have a option to go online and be able to do it there school work from video conferencing or line work. It's just an alternative for people who are sick and want to do school work or have injuries.

Home schooling is a lot faster to do than regular school. Home schooling can be done in three to four hours other than the eight hours of school not mention you get out earlier in the year then regular students. Well that depends if your doing everything you need to do of course. If your really into it you can get your course's done within a few months and be done with that year. Home schooling is good if you like getting to the point. it's a great learning experience and also dont worry saying if i do home schooling am i going to get into college of course home schooling goes of the same grading as regular schools goes off of so dont worry.

With home schooling you feel mean different things and can experience it as well. your in a quiet place and your focusing and your just one on one with teacher so you get to grow as well with the teacher and learn new thing's. It gives you more options when your sick or you have an injuries. It's just always great to have that back up so if you ever get out of this you have that backdoor you can go through. And with home schooling you get done two times faster than regular school who would not like that and you get out sooner. Just home schooling is just something to have a backdoor to or you want to stay more focused or you just want to get faster.                      ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
16C808F5F642,"School is often learned to be a hated word by the youth of modern society. Every morning, students slug out of bed and dread the thought of stepping into the rigid building known as high school. Education is the gateway to a brighter future, but every day, when freedom is restricted, students become less motivated to learn. No music, no talking, no shorts, no colorful pens; everything that once made school an exciting place is sucked out making high school simply black and white. Every dull and depressed face in the hall is from the daily torture of forced and restricted learning. Online education gives students the opportunity to grow as a person and develop skills to carry with them when entering the real world. Unlike physically going to school, online classes provide the option to work freely at each student's own pace, learning in whatever style best suits them, and avoiding social stress associated with school.

Every individual learns at different paces and in different ways. It is nearly impossible for a teacher to match every single student's learning style and speed at the same time. If a teacher moves quickly to help more advanced students to reach their full learning potential, students that process information slower will get left behind. However, if a teacher moves slower, quick processors feel bored and don't gather as much information as they could. Taking an online class gives every student the freedom to move through information as fast or as slow as they feel. Everybody's learning style can be tailored through online learning by providing many options of learning such as at home labs, lecture videos, discussions, and visual presentations. Some students could even have the option to travel while taking classes to learn more from the world around them while still receiving background information.

A huge problem faced today by students is increased social anxieties that are mostly due to the exclusive social circle society moves in. Depression causes some students to feel hopeless in school and the loss of motivation takes a toll on their learning. If students find it easier to connect to a subject without getting social, online classes are the perfect solution. Each student can choose their exposure to social situations by talking virtually or avoiding people all together by using online notes and other provided tools.

The choice of every student to drag themselves to school everyday or wake up ready to learn can depend on the option to take learning into their own hands.

97C83ED95515,"Imagine you are waking up on your first day of school, only to turn around and grab your computer to begin your lesson for the week. For some, this is a reality, in areas where schools are becoming more open to the idea of ""distance learning,"" or off campus learning. However, going to school and gaining first hand experience with all different types of people is the easiest way for young people to be exposed to diversity, and to engage in interactive educational activities. School provides many opportunities for young people that an online program simply cannot do. Even video conferences, are limited in providing a real school adaptation. In my opinion, students are being held back more than progressing from online courses. Distance classes take away the human interaction of school, and hold students back from personal growth; thus, it should only be an option for special cases.

From the moment you are placed in school, you are constantly adapting to new environments, classes, and people. School is one of the easiest ways for a young person to find friends or people that they can trust and rely on. Some students need these social interactions to help show them that not everyone is similar, opening their eyes to diverse ideas, cultures, and ways of life. Having all of your courses online is isolating and can lead students down a path of lonliness, since they will be missing out on all of the human-interaction that going to a regular school provides. Students need a support system for them to count on, which may be found at school, if they do not feel safe and loved at home. In most cases, middle and high schools provide in depth science lab activities, math modeling activties, interactive games, field trips, and group projects. These activities bring students together in a way that only a personal experience can. Having to work together in small groups helps students understand one another and also helps them look at concepts through different perspectives. Virtual activties never leave as strong of an impact on the student as hands-on actvities do, or give them experience with other students. Overall, online schooling only decreases a persons social skills and promotes isolation.

As I said before, students have lost that student to student relationsip when learning all alone, but also they lose the student to teacher relationship. There are teachers that have such a lasting impact on students and they may not even realize it, they may be looked at as a mentor, an inspiration, or even a friend in certain situations. Having a module instructor is not neccesarily having a human connection; we can all watch videos of a teacher online and feel no personal connection to the person behind the screen. Tecahers are able to provoke in depth thinking and analysis from students, from personal experience and seeing how their students learn best. Some students may learn visually, through song, or maybe through repititon, this simple fact goes to show another reason online courses are not beneficial to all students. Everyone has a unique way of learning, an online course or a video conference may not be able to provide the same accomodations for a student that a one on one student-teacher relationship would. Students should be exposed to all learning types to see which ways are easiest for them, instead of being forced to overwork trying to figure a problem out without aid.

Although, in some cases, I do believe there should be an online alternative to the average school. Students that have had an injury and may be unable to attend school for medical reasons, should be given the opportunity to study and learn outside of the school building. There may be cases where a student with special needs is not ready to be placed into a super social setting, and I do agree that they should be given the option of an online schooling program to best fit them and their needs. The argument could be made that online, isolated courses would prevent bullying and provide students with a more comfortable learning environment. I refute this point, by stating that to learn and grow we must be placed outside of our comfort zones and forced to experience new things that we typically could not at home. We cannot grow in a stagnant environment. Looking at a computer screen every day, is not the best way to stimulate young minds, they must be provided with experiences that they can learn from first handedly.

In conclusion, I am not in favor of students taking courses online as a substitute for going to school. The school building is like a network of support for each and every student who eneters. Teachers try their hardest to accomodate to every student and provide them with the extra help they need, or help them gain independence and confidence. An online program is in no way going to care about the mental health of the students or give them an extra uplift when they are struggling. In other words, distance learning should only be provided for students with special accomadations, otherwise you are taking away the opportunity for interaction and student self growth. When considering offering classes from home, we need to remember that we are building the future generation. Do we really want to raise a group of young individuals that can only function in isolated environments because they have not been exposed to human interaction? ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
180B47FDF4C2,"Students that use the way of the internet to execute their online work, should have the choice to either take online classes or physically be in the classroom. In a way, online classes help the student if they obtain a focusing disability, the course can be slowed down, and the student can take their time while also having the ability to learn. Also, physically being in a class can be very distracting because of other students, video games that may be brought to class, or just the loudness a class can come up to.

Online classes give a student and their teacher hands on with teaching, if there is something interrupting the students lesson mentally, teachers can figure out and pin point the main problem easier and faster than in a classroom filled with twenty or more kids. Video conferencing is another alternative that lets the instructor visually observe how the student reacts to something new, teenagers tend to pay more attention when they are alone than when they are in a crowd of peers meaning, alone time for teens and anyone gives them time to think and process information.

A downside to online classes is that students may not make friends as often as they would in public or private school, homeschooling is a challenge but should not be looked down upon just because the lack of social communication a child may have, as long as the child graduates and tends to do really well with their progress in online classes then there is no reason that they should be put into public or private education, unless said otherwise by the student themselves.

Every parent wants nothing but the best for their child, if online classes and virtual conferencing is one of them then that option should be taken up on. In a stance of things, school and education come first and if a student would rather go to a party to amp up their social status then homeschooling is not for them and they should be placed in publice schooling. Homeschool is a learning system for people who want to work better towards their goals which may include college, a job after highschool, or even into the military.

Any and everything needs an educational background and it all depends on how a student wants to execute it towards what they want to do later in life, if they are stronger in public school then they should be placed in that branch, if they are stronger in private school then they should not even have a second thought towards that decision, but if they are willing to drop those two options and homeschool where you are head on with an instructor, then that should be an option if they want first hand help with their work.       ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
774AC0E422C9,"Online Learning: An Ineffective Teaching Method

With the emergence of modern technology in our everyday lives, it often seems logical that it should be integrated into our school systems.

Many schools allow children to take classes online through ""distance learning"" programs.

However, online learning is not nearly as effective as physical school at teaching children and giving them a solid understanding of the subject matter.

It allows students to fool around without restriction and encourages them not to attend school in the first place.

Furthermore, school should stay primarily uninvolved from the home life of a child.

Some think that it would be especially great for those who cannot physically attend school because of health reasons.

Those individuals should be focussing on recovering rather than their education.

Online learning is not nearly as effective at educating students.

At the school I attend, online courses are offered as a replacement for physical classroom courses.

From speaking to others that have taken online courses, they all view them as a nuisance that does not teach them anything comparable to taking an actual class at school.

All of the students who have taken them do not think they have really learned anything because of them.

This makes sense because of how easy it is to get distracted when on the computer.

Even students with good self control have difficulty sitting in on a virtual lecture when pressing the new tab button and opening YouTube would be simple.

For this reason, online classes will never be capable of matching the teaching capabilities of an actual learning environment, like school.

Aside form the evident issues of productivity and effectiveness of online education, home should be a place where school should stay primarily uninvolved.

Everyone looks forward to a returning home after a hard day of work or school.

If school primarily takes place at home, then students will associate their own safe place with hard work and frustration when it should be a place to decompress.

A separation between learning and relaxing locations is necessary for optimal learning conditions.

Many think that online schooling would be a good way to avoid kids having to attend school, especially for those who are not physically able to.

Online schooling may be useful for children who are to sick to attend school, however it does not provide any useful advantage to students who are capable of attending school normally.

Also, students who are not physically able to attend school for medical reasons should be focusing on recovering rather than schoolwork.

If online schooling is given as an option over normal education, it will allow more kids to slack off without the encouragement and motivation that a physical classroom provides.

It would also eliminate the beneficial seperation between school and home life.

Online learning is an ineffective teaching method.        ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5173FB3C75A9,"Today, we often depend on technology. From home to school to work, it is now an essential tool in our everyday lives. As the years go by, people are becoming more and more innovative in the ways they're using it. For instance, long distance learning is now being offered as a learning option for students. Although technology has drastically improved since it first became popular, it is important to acknowledge the fact that there are still imperfections that can negatively impact students' school and personal life. Internet crashes, hackers, and lack of social skill are only few of many hardships a long distance learner may face.

Many of us rely on technology without knowing the right procedure to take when it fails us. Say a student decides to enroll in the long distance learning program. It started off great until one day his internet crashes. He tried everything that he could think of, but he can't seem to fix it. He has no choice but to call his internet company for help. He's then notified that they won't be able to come to his home and assist him for another 3 days. That's 3 days of lessons that he will miss. Even when his internet is fixed, there's an high chance that he'll get hacked. There are over 300 million hack attempts a day! His identity and personal information, like his address, could be stolen and he could potentially be put in danger. On the other hand, schools usually have professional staff that specializes in computers and technology during all school hours. At school, getting hacked and internet crashes will less likely happen and if they do, they have the staff to fix it. You may think that going to the library or going to a friend's house is a perfect solution, but there is no guarantee they'll be available every time you have a technical difficulty.

Social skills are critical when it comes to school, careers, and everyday life. Being able to socialize comfortably and confidently is an important skill for success, especially if your career choice requires you to do so. People usually start building their social skills when they first start school, where they interact and communicate with their peers. Students miss out on this opportunity when they only learn by clicking and scrolling on a screen in the vicinity of their home. People often get comfortable with isolation and adapt to being alone and never learn how to communicate properly with others. Lacking these skills can effect the long distance learners' performance at job interviews and daily tasks that requires them to speak to others around them. This could result in them missing out on the opportunity to flourish in the career field they studied hard for and the opportunity to develop good relationships with other people.

With social skills, resources, and good relationships, students are more likely to achieve their goals. Being without these things, long distance learning students are set behind for the outside world. Therefore, all students should attend school the traditional way to obtain all the benefits and opportunities to be as successful as they can. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6A47B80F3283,"I believe, the schools which ones offers distance classes for students is a really good option for alot of people for a several reasons.

Some persons wants to finish carriers of schools, but they cant for this reasons.

- They does not have much time to do it, because they have to work, pay bills and stuff like that.

-Some students get out of the schools becauses they wants to help their family , and pass more time with them; take caring of they youngues bothers, sister, or work to get many into their house.

Taking classes at home wil be the better options for the studens which ones wants to conitinue their carrier after high school, into the university,becasuse they can have a time to work, and to pay they carrier , and to get done what they wnats to be and their future ...

Some carriers are really expensives, and a parents cant pay for it. Well the students can work and get many. And the same time with this programs they can still continue with they classes .

Also begin home taking a classes, should be a better more consentration and relaxing eating an apple, least worrys and getting ready for a better future. Doing classes work and the free time and having time to do others staff.

Classes a distance, will be the better option for alot of peoples, they can have time to do many things done at the same time .

9254D9526E87,"Students would greatly benefit from being able to take classes at home because kids are sometimes sick and can't attend class, it teaches students to work more independently, and allows them to work in a more comfortable environment. School in person is important too for students because they will interact with other people which is an important part of growing up. Some people though rely too heavily on teachers and other students help while they are at school and don't work individually. There should be a balance so kids have the opportunity to experience both working by themselves and collaborating with others.

On average, students miss at least a few days of school every year due to being ill or just away on a vacation. If you miss even just 1 or 2 days of school it can be very difficult for kids to make up all the work since they missed the lecture by the teacher in class. Certain classes don't post what you missed online making it even harder to learn the material when you weren't in class that day. Most of the time when people are sick they usually watch TV or look at their phone so teachers mine as well record a video of them teaching the class so that way students can learn the lesson while they are at home.

When kids grow up and become adults likely they will have a job or might live by themselves and will need to know how to be independent. If students took some online classes this would force them to problem solve and do research to find the answer when they don't have someone they can ask. At school when kids don't know the answer often they will just ask their friend or the teacher while this occasionally can be good, it doesn't teach them how to find the answer on their own. Depending on your job you may not always have a person there to help you out when you're in a struggle. Most of the work done in college is required to be online nowadays even majority of the textbooks you read are online.

At home you are more relaxed and in a more familiar environment than school. The chairs at school may often be uncomfortable, you might not have the best lunch selection if you are a student who buys, and there could also be more distractions such as your friends. You could argue that it's important to put yourself in uncomfortable situations but at least when you are an adult and more independent you will have the luxury of picking what you eat for lunch or even bringing in your own chair. People work more efficiently when they are in a place that feels more normal to them.

To be successful in life a person needs to know how to work with other people but also individually. While in person school learning is seen to be the preferred option by most people, people should also consider all the benefits online school brings to the table. With all the new technology coming out to improve electronics it is a perfect time for schools to implement online learning programs. The job of parents and high school teachers is to get their child ready for the real world and online courses are one of the best ways to do this.          ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
E099AB8BFFC5,"Distance learning is very beneficial for a certain amount of students due to the fact that everyone learns differently. There are multiple reasons why a student could find distance learning more beneficial. Not every student can afford to spend money on gas for their vehicle or have enough money to even afford a vehicle. This is where distance learning comes into play, with our advances in technology we can now learn from the comfort of our own home without having to worry about the cons of going to a public school. The main reasons why distance learning is more beneficial is mostly because students tend to get picked on by other students for multiple reasons. Another reason why distance learning is very helpful is because students have their own schedule to work with. These are only some of the benefits, there are even more benefits that will change your mind about going to a public school ever again.

The way distance learning has also been known to help more students than public school is because of how easy it is to catch up when you are falling behind because the work will always be there prerecorded and ready to watch with ease. Distance learning can also help a student that has social anxiety because they won't have to socialize with other students. The students will also have time for their own personal things instead of using extra hours of their day listening to nonsense from public schools. A far more cautious and respective reason as to why distance learning is more beneficial is because there is a lower chance of getting sick because you wont be crowded around so many germs. Bullying is one of the main factors of going to a public school but with distance learning the student does not have to worry about being bothered by others. There is mostly nothing but more benefits in online school than there is in public school. Generally speaking, the possibilities to learning with distance learning are almost endless due to the fact that our technology advances everyday making our lives easier. One of the most important reasons why distance learning is far more superior to public school is because you block yourself out from bad influences and gang activity. Almost anyone has a working computer at home so why not give distance learning a try and see how it benefits you.

In conclusion, distance learning has nothing but benefits for the student such as the environment and scheduling. So why not give it a try? The benefits help out mentally and physically and doing work is easier without any distractions from bullies and drama. Especially with technology anything can be done virtually which makes life more convenient. Imagine having your own schedule and your own classroom right in your house. Just think about how easy it would be if everyone would just do distance learning, there would be less bad influences and less gang activity. Hopefully you make the right decision and choose what is best for you, with all of the reasoning and supportive detail to backup why distance learning is far more superior should make everyone think about trying distance learning.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
552E1E612147,"Students face many challenges while in school. These challenges might be a test, a quiz, or a sport that they play for the school. However, one of the biggest problems that students face that is not often talked about is catching up on work after missing many days of school. It is stressful, difficult, and time consuming to try and complete all of this missing work from not being at school. This could be easily changed with the formation of a distance learning program. Distance learning would be very beneficial to students because it would allow students to learn while at home sick, learn while traveling, and it would let people who would prefer to learn from home still get the proper education needed to be successful.

The first reason as to why distance learning would benefit students is for when a student is sick and does not feel good enough to make it to school. Most of the time when a student gets sick, they do not go to school because they do not feel good. That being said, there are also many students who will still go to school despite being sick because they don't want to miss anything and get behind on work. If distance learning was offered, students would not feel the need to attend school when they are not feeling well and could just learn all of the material from at home. Of course, there are some circumstances where a student is just too sick to do anything and will not be able to focus or learn, but the majority of students absent on a daily basis is because of sickness. Also, implementing distance learning would not only help the student who is sick, but the students and teachers all around him or her. That means that this distance learning program would not only benefit students who are missing school, but also the students who are still in school. The teachers would also be sick less often, and it would make things easier for them since they won't have to worry about getting their students all caught up to date. Implementing a distance learning program would certainly help students who are out with sickness.

Another reason why distance learning would be a benefit is because it allows students who are on vacation or out of town to learn. The second leading reason as to why students miss days of school is because they are out of town. This could be for sports, a family reunion, vacation, and so many other reasons. One specific example that relates to many students are sports. Many students miss games due to tournaments that are far away, and require a hotel for an overnight stay wherever this tournament or game is located. If distance learning was an option, students would be less stressed about the work that they are about to receive when getting back to school and can just do it when not playing. Another big reason for students missing school is vacation. This is where distance learning would benefit students the most. A student could be across the world traveling and learning about new places while still learning about the material necessary in school. This would allow for students to learn more about the world. This will make students going forward smarter. Distance learning would be beneficial for students who are traveling so they can learn from afar.

The last reason why distance learning would be beneficial is because it would allow students who would rather school from home get a good education. There are many reasons as to why a student would prefer to learn from at home. Some people may have social anxiety, and others may just not want to learn in a school environment. Offering distance learning would help these students learn while in their home. This would make students more comfortable, and usually when a student isn't stressed and comfortable, they perform better. This would increase test scores across the country and increase the knowledge of students across the country. Students would benefit from distance learning if they prefer to learn from at home.

Students face a lot of adversity throughout their time in school. Not only are students trying to maintain good grades and a good grade point average, but there are many distractions. Offering distance learning would just make it easier for students to complete their work on time and not have any overload of work. Students would benefit from distance learning because they can learn while they are at home sick, out of town, or simply just prefer to learn from at home.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D26C9B0368D0,"No, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a lot of action students have to take from being home school.

For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. I'm not saying all students can't attend online classes at home, but most cannot.

Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. In addition of other students because i can't speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them.

School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students. Other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. You can't forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you.

Another reason being home schooled isn't a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them.

School is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. Every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. School is the most popular place in the world. Getting a education and great job is good reasons why you should come to school. Great job equals great money. Good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges.

8C15FC3C3BCB,"Everyday I wake up and catch the bus at 6:50 in the morning, and I don't get home until 5:45 at night. That's nearly twelve hours of being on the bus and being at school when I could be doing something more productive like cleaning my room, sleeping, or studying for a test. As much as I don't like school, taking it online would hardly be helpful. Some people may say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. Clearly, they are wrong because it would be easy to cheat and students would face isolation.

With online school, it would be extremely easy to cheat. Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment. Some people are going to say that happens regardless of whether or not it's in person or online. They are wrong because it's much easier to cheat online with a very low chance of getting caught.

One thing a person could face while attending online school is isolation. In prison, solitary confinement is a punishment, so why make it an everyday thing as a free person? The best part about school for most, if not all, of us is our friends. For those with best friends, going a long time without them is a task. You don't have your laughing buddy and you miss them, even if you have other friends you couldnt be with. Most people feel sad when they don't have a friend to be with them in class and share the same struggles with when you fail or do bad. School is at least seventy-seven percent better when you have friends to go at it with. When you're in your room all day learning, that's no fun. School is required by the government and is already sad enough as it is. The only thing that personally keeps me going is my friends. Without them, I would have no will to do my work as they are the ones constantly telling me to do this and do that and don't procrastinate. Those friendly reminders are honestly what keep me from failing my classes. I couldn't name all the times I forgot to do an assignment and my friends were like, ""did you do so and so?"" And I would say, ""oh wow I completely forgot about that, thanks for reminding me,"" and would get started at lunch or in the morning. So if school were to be offered online, those reminders would fall through the cracks and I would have missing assignments left and right. People may say that school online doesn't affect friendships. On the contrary, they are extremely wrong because you wouldn't be able to see them everyday as you normally do during the school day.

Some people say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. However, they are incorrect because it would be easy to cheat and students would face isolation from their friends. Cheating would be readily available as you don't have the teachers eyes on you which makes it easier to cheat, no matter how honest a teenager says they are because we are impulsive beings who rarely think logically. Isolation would be a terrible added factor of online school as friends keep most of us going during the school day.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
ED830B1151E7,"Distance Learning in School Systems

In today's society, many school systems are reliant on technology; this is not always beneficial for certain individuals. If schools become too reliant on technology, then it can result in a negative impact on the progress of students. Many individuals struggle to complete their work from an electronic device because it puts a strain on their eyes. A number of school systems are considering the idea of allowing their students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because there would be multiple distractions, some students do not have internet access at home, and it would be difficult for students to receive help.

Firstly, schools should not offer distance learning as an option for students because their would be multiple distractions at home. Success comes from hard work and dedication, and if students do not have that, then school will not come easy. When students work from home, there are multiple factors to put into consideration, such as cellular devices and pets. In this day and age, many students are overly worried about social media and their friends instead of their grades. For example, most students would choose to text their friends when they should be completing their assignments and projects. This issue would result in students receiving poor grades for the semester. It is obvious that allowing students to complete their assignments from home would not be beneficial.

Secondly, online classes would not benefit the students because some individuals do not have internet access at home. Many families do not pay for internet since it can become expensive, and they do not want another added expense to worry about. This issue would result in individuals having to commute to a public location, such as a coffee shop to complete their work. Since some students would have to travel, then they would have to spend more money on items, such as gasoline, food, and drinks. This problem can be stressful for individuals because they would need to learn how to use their time wisely and work efficiently. One can easily see that transferring to online classes would not help students in the long run.

Lastly, school systems should not offer distance learning for students because it would be difficult for them to receive help and ask questions. For some students, it will be hard for them to completely understand the content if they do not have visuals on the board in front of them to look at. If an individual thought of a question, it would be frustrating because the professor would not be able to visibly see the student raise their hand. The students and professors would also have to plan their time accordingly because it will be difficult if the students at home joined the conference at different times. Based on this information, it is obvious that allowing individuals to work from home would be difficult for the students and professors.

Many people believe that allowing students to work from home would be beneficial because they would not have to wake up at a certain time to get ready. However, this could result in the students becoming lazy and making poor choices. This situation may sound similar for some athletes. Before a season begins, many athletes choose to practice in their time off, so they are prepared for the upcoming season. Although this is true for most people, there are always a few teammates that have the mindset that they are better than everyone else and choose not to prepare. Ultimately, this leads to those individuals performing poorly in the next season. One can easily see that attending classes at school is the best option for everyone.

Because there would be many distractions, some students do not have internet access at home, and it would be difficult to receive help, students would not benefit from attending classes at home. In the modern world, assessments are a huge way of showing professors how well the student understands the material. Without a full understanding of the content, it would be difficult for individuals to show what they truly know. For parents, this idea is very concerning because it can affect their child's future. After all, it would be frustrating to know that students are struggling in school because they chose to work from home instead of at school.           ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

Though they are such a program to rely on for learning purposes,They get boring and makes it so easy to veer you towards a different purpose of your time ;making it one of my reasons why i feel schools should not conduct out of school online courses. With doing online courses you have to consider having contact with teacher if needed extra help on learning new assignments ,as well as ""trying to play catch up with Bad connection"". Mother always to told me man over machine anyway.

It is guaranteed students wont pay attention to have online classes when they can easily ignore,or postpone for how long they think it is right for them to finish. Without repercussions students themselves will tremendously lower their academic progression. The biggest problem with the public board of Education today is students constantly on their phone distracted with social media;but,at least have disciplinary consequences seeking to slim out the chance to put the screen to your face.

Following up with your teacher is the easiest solution when needing more help on challenging arithmetic and indescribable essays .During an online process it demonstrates the process in which you need to solve. Unlike who i am, I usually need a hands on experience to understand how things work. If you were to consider most of the people like me ,how would you change that option if its within an online course? There are tutors that usually cost too much money as well. There isn't much you can change about someones ability besides feed it for succession.

Technical difficulties could most likely have the biggest impact on someones learning experience when online .Having bad connection , new router, or just not being able to log on at all for some reason. Sometimes when doing my online homework programs it consist of a certain amount of connection and its longevity. Due to not being able to access it that day,it forces me to come to school or a local library to finish it. If that type of problem were implemented in to school board online courses it would either corrupt or erase your progress.

Some would say that it would be a not bad idea to learn at home and do things that don't require of a whole lot of ""class to class"" movement .Some would say that decreasing distractions decrease the amount of stress in wanting to understand the teacher .Poverty has made up about 53% of our country .For those people, how will they ever learn if they don't have the resources in order to become what they can?75% of students in poverty depend on the food the school serves them as well. If i didnt know when or where the next breakfast and lunch was coming from ,i would expect to learn and eat at a public school.

i learned today that students wouldn't take the opportunity of learning online seriously,especially if really looking forward to it. The feeling of a teacher being within my presence to help me,but instead waiting the next day for the teacher to respond back at 12:30 am on Google classroom. I learned that i take a magnet school like wood side such for granted and that they shower me with hospitality with no intent to have gratitude. My father always said to me ""you never know somethings value until it is lost.""",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
88A4F79B5203,"Home schooling would not be benefitial for students and society as a whole. This form of education would harm the student in the long run due to lack of social engagement with other students and people in general. Getting an education provided at home and not at the school may also slow down the process of becoming an independent person in society. Decision making would be much more difficult due to lack of real world experiences.

The damage towards the students social engagement in the long run would be severe. Humans are a unique type of species that like to socialize with other human beings, its just the way we were made. Humans would also need to build and improve there social skills and build character overtime. The one place where you develop social skills and build your character as a whole would be public schools, and allowing students to become home schooled would change the outcome of who that student is as a person in a negative way; That would just be a disservice to not only the student, but society overall.

The process of becoming more of an independent person as a student would be much slower if you were home schooled most you life. When homeschooled, you have everything at reach including your parental figures, which would mean that you would be more reliant towards your parental figures and aswell you would not need to leave your home. The transition between being a teenager to becoming an adult would be much harder due to the lack of social skills and character provided from being home schooled.

Decision making would be much more difficult and ineffective for someone who is home schooled compared to someone who has gone to public school most of there life. People make decisions and choices based off the real world experiences they have had in there life. Being home schooled would mean you would have a lack of experience in society compared to someone who has gone to public school most there life. Having real world experience is very benefitial and will help out anyone in the longrun, therefore home schooling would not be appropriate for students.

Due to its negative effects towards the student as a person overtime, homeschooling would not be benefitial towards students or society as a whole; Therefore education should not be provided at home, and should be provided in a safe area with a social friendly enviorment.         ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
662BC175152E,"In today's generation there has been a higher percentage of people working thanks to the invention of computers and new technology; causing people being able to work from home. This idea could be implemented to students in school. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, students will be able to learn how to manage time, will cause less stress, and transportation would not be problem

Throughout a kids life they are constantly told when to and when to not do certain things in school. An average student has been taught by a teacher since kindergarten when to do their work and when is the best time to do it; therefore they find it harder to do things on their own. For example, Generic_Name is a senior in Generic_School that is currently taking online virtual classes. He struggled outside of high school to do tasks and daily chores because he did not know how or when is the best time to do them. Generic_Name said, the first thing he learned in 1st Quarter was time management. He learned himself that, even though there is a lot of free time compared to taking classes in school, you have to learn how to use it and manage it correctly to get your work done. He learned these skills by taking online classes. Generic_Name recommends to take online classes, because it will most likely benefit someone who is trying to learn how to manage their time the right way.

An average student in high school is assigned to do many tasks, whether it is working on assignments, going to practice after school, waking up early, or etc. That amount of work leads to stress that isn't healthy for a growing teenager, For instance, Generic_Name was on the football team in Generic_School in his sophomore year. He feels that his sophomore year had caused a lot of stress due to him, having practice after 7 hours of school, not getting enough sleep at times, since he had to stay up at night to get his homework done, and many other things. Generic_Name is now a junior this year taking online classes. He notices that the amount of stress he has this year is nothing compared to last year, it is like comparing the size of an ant to the size of a tiger. Online classes gave him more freedom when to do assignments. Now he has the ability to create his own schedule.

Lastly, Another reason why students would benefit from being able to work from home would be, not needing transportation. Transportation effects every students day it could be, waiting for the bus in the morning, not having a ride, or even worrying about having enough money to pay for gasoline every day. This is a problem that would be completely and easily solved by being able to attend classes from home. A perfect example of this successfully working on a student is a student named Generic_Name, Generic_Name is not the most privileged student in his school. He had a schedule of having to attend his classes in the afternoon instead of attending in the morning. His schedule suited him well, he had a working car that made him able to drive to school on his designated time. Everything was fine until, unfortunately, Generic_Name got in a car accident that totaled his car. Due to him not having a job and his parents not having enough money to purchase a new one, Generic_Name was stuck without a ride to school. He had to come up with a way to arrive to school on time. He had friends pick him up, but he thought to himself that is not going to last very long. Generic_Name spoke to his counselor about being able to switch to online classes. When his counselor asked why, he explained his whole situation. His counselor understood and did her best to switch him to online classes. Two days later, Generic_Name was given his online syllabus. Generic_Name was delighted of not having to worry about how to get to school thanks to being able to take online courses.

To wrap it up, while some may argue that students being able to attend classes from home, will cause laziness, a weaker work ethic, and etc. These reasons will not justify the amount of people that benefit from being able to take online classes. Students are already given a copious amount of stress, why should they be limited to stay in the school with them being constantly being told what to do? Students would benefit in a tremendous way by being able to complete classes at home because, students will be able to learn how to manage time, it will lessen the amount of stress, and transportation would not be a problem the student would have to worry about. Overall, the idea of giving these young students the ability of working from home, should be a no brainer.  ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

RE: Classes online

Not bacause I take classes online many of the students will not be responsible and they miss many grades, They will even have not internet in online classes for be doing their own things at home for example, if i have online classes i would be distranted by my brother or other things and i feel that my online classes is not would not be good idea like i say that online class is not a good idea there are many distraction. also, if we have that problem I think that beging with teachers is the best idea cause they help us a lot in the amies.

The firs reason is not all student have the internet in the houses some students don't have the internet because their parents don't have too much money to but one or maybe because they don't have the tecnology. One friend told me that their parents think that the tecnology is bad for him because it is distraction and he needs to focus on his future. and if he dosen't take that class online he will fall that class. every parents think different.

Another reason because not all student are not responsibles. some student came to school but they don't do anything' but it the teacher letf them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will no care about the class, And they don't will take care about the class.

The conclusion is tha bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, anbd not all the students have it, they need to have their responsability the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not al the students like to have classes online because they know that they can't consentrate in their house bacause all the noise around.

D8C3DD3A74F1,"Other's say that students will not benefit by taking classes from online or video conferencing.

I on the other hand, think that taking online classes are helpful to students who are not able to attend real classes.

Some students, may find it hard to actually go to school. These classes are there for, students who might have serious sickness or a serious issue. They will get the education they need like every other student regardless to any problem. It might be different from a real class but, it helps the people in need. Some students might be going through stuff, for example getting bullied in school and, not being able to go back to face negativity, others will make up their minds to stay away from something like that. Some people might say that you are running away from a problem but, that probably was not ""your"" intention. Others might also take online classes due to being sick and, not being able to go out without the help of someone so, a student will probably stay home and also get the help they need.

The problem will not always function around critical conditions, because there are college students who take online classes and 99% of them are doing fine. Some people do not learn better online and some do but, that's fine because taking online classes are not by force, and students have the right to choose what can help them learn. There is a lot of reasons why online classes are not good and, a lot of reasons why it might be helpful to other students and not all. Some of these reasons are, transportation but that's not really common though, it can be an issue. Some students also find online classes easier because, it is basic steps and, instead of waking up every morning going to class you can just simply stay home and get the work done. Another reason why other's find real classes helpful or beneficial than, online classes might be based on their learning strategies for intents, learning better when taught to in person even though, online classes do the same with videos taught step by step. Another reason might be notes taking because, some students learn better when taking notes in class and,later on doing an assignment by looking at these notes but then, online classes is kind of similar to real classes, it is just the fact that there is no teacher teaching it in a classroom but doing it online.

There are many ways both real classes and online classes are beneficial and ways they both might not be as helpful, but online classes are much easier and less stressful. Even know schools and teacher's a sign their students homework's where the computer does half the work and the teacher does the grading and a little teaching. So, i do not see the point in going to school and taking these computer classes when you can easily stay home, study , and get your work done by taking online classes. It is an option for students to attend real classes or online classes, but of course it will be based of the way every student learn.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
6685C02108BA,"A lot of students could benefit from such a program, be it if they are sick, antisocial, or just not the type for regular school. It would offer these students a new way to learn that may or may not be the way that they would prefer. Even if they just live far away from the school that they wish to go to, like college, it would be extremely beneficial to not have to travel long distances to get to school, or have to buy a dorm room for an amount of time. I do feel like it would be hard on the teachers though having to deal with the class, and setting up the things that the online students need as well.

If they were to offer this in high school, you bet there would be a lot of people doing this, I personally know a lot of people that would rather be home schooled or do their schoolwork from home instead of coming in everyday, changes classes, and dealing with all sorts of different dynamics, rather than just simply working from a computer at home. Let's say a student gets sick and misses two weeks of school, if this program was implemented today, students like these would have less to no make up work to complete when they return, thus keeping them from getting too far behind and risk failing a class. That would also mean average grades would likely go up, do to people missing school not getting behind.

For students who would like to attend college this would be an extraordinary boon if they lived far away or dont have the money for a dorm space, imagine living in Washington State and wanting to go to Louisiana State University, it would be very difficult to travel with all of your things down there and move into a rinky dink little dorm space, just to get the education that you want. Now if you were planning on doing this and you were offered online courses for the same instruction, and not having to move halfway across the country, I think you would take in a heartbeat. It would also likely be more cost efficient than moving, buying a dorm, paying for gas, and driving to school everyday.

Now as for my personal opinion on the matter, I feel as if it is both a great idea and a terrible one, it's great because if a student wants to be at home to be away from people, or for any other reason to work on their education, then well on them, but you have to realize school is one of the few places when people are young get to really get out and socialize with other young people instead of being cooped up in a house all day with nothing to do. Imagine being at home and doing the work you do for school in the earlier parts of the day then going to work until about dark, then coming back home just to eat sleep and do it all again tomorrow, sounds pretty bleak right? So as my final regards, it would be wonderful for education purposes, but not for social gain in any way, shape, or form.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
F11E6745A8DA,"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they'll be ready because thats how college is online.

Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed.

Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home.

finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.?

In conclution online classses and video conferencing is the best way of learning. yes they benefit from learning and it helps them out. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
233A35247566,"Online learning is a controversial topic among traditional and modern educators. The rivalry between face to face classes and online classes is not necessary. Encouraging students to use their resources to learn in the best way for them is what is most important. All students have different learning abilities and strategies; some people struggle to abide by the strict school rules which takes away from their learning experience. Some may argue that learning through a computer cannot compete with traditional schooling, but there are significant benefits to both. Overall, providing online classes as an option for students opens the window to success.

It is obvious that almost every student has a different way of learning. Some people like to watch videos to grasp concepts. This is a resource that is not always available during school. While taking a course online, students have free range of the educational side of YouTube and the internet, which will benefit them. Other students need to write down a topic to comprehend it. This is a strategy that is available in school and during online classes, except while taking an online class, there is no rush to write something down as fast as you can to beat the bell. This can sometimes cause sloppiness and flaws. Many like to work in groups, while some prefer working alone. Group work is easier to achieve in regular school, but not impossible in an online class. Collaboration is prevalent in online classes as well. There is not one way to learn; likewise, there's not one way to teach. Online schooling provides options for students, which only betters the education system.

School systems have to make certain rules to keep their students safe, but sometimes the rules take away from learning. Online classes give students a chance to relieve themselves from the strict school rules, and focus on doing their best work. For example, while most students are cooped up in the same building all day, a student who is taking a course at their house can choose to complete their work outside. Working outside will stimulate the brain and can improve the results of the assignment. Yet, this is not an option in most schools. Online classes open up this opportunity for improvement among work environment. Another benefit to working at home is the availability of resources. In school, phones are not permitted. Because cell phones are the most used part of technology by students, they may be a good tool to use during education. The ability to take notes on cell phones is a benefit that comes with online schooling. For some, the rules are necessary to focus and complete tasks while staying safe. For others, the harsh rules are a setback. Online classes provide students with a valid way out if the school environment does not work for them.

There are still people who believe that online school cannot compare to traditional learning. Face to face education may seem to have an advantage over learning through a screen. However, there are many misconceptions about online classes. Although it may seem like the student is taking the class alone, there are always others enrolled at the same time. Many online courses require video chats or discussion boards between these students. This is still collaboration, even though it is not in person. It is necessary to collaborate with others in person and online. In this era, online communication is just as important and valid. Furthermore, students must create a balance between in person learning and online learning. Everyone should try out different things to see what works best for them. Sticking with one way of living leads people to stay stagnant in their progress. Although some argue against online classes, they are a necessary option so people can have a plethora of experiences.

The differences in education are what makes it beautiful. Every person should be able to voice what works for them and what doesn't. Educators should support these differences and encourage students to improve, even if it requires a different school system. If school rules or strict bell schedules are holding a student back from their highest potential, there is no reason they should stay there. Online schooling is a way for students to explore themselves. It may seem odd to traditional educators, but if everyone is open to it, then more students are given the opportunity to learn. Offering online courses will strongly benefit the education experience for many people.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4743067BEABE,"Distance learning in schools is a way for students to attend classes from an online resource or by video conferencing. Video conferencing is a good option for students who can't regularly attend school because of different situations in their lives. Some people may argue that being able to attend classes form home through a computer screen would hurt a students social skills because of the lack of face to face conversations, but it would actually help those students make friends with other classmates that live farther away from them. Video conferencing would benefit all teachers, students, and parents because it would allow students to learn while they are sick, prepare them for their professional lives, and help them to learn new social skills.

Video conferencing would help give kids an education when they are sick and unable to attend normal school through the convince of being in their room. Instead of missing days of school due to sickness, these students would be able to log onto their computers and participate in class from their house. This would hep reduce the stress of make up work on students and give teachers less stress on catching the sick student up with what they missed. Video chatting would also limit the spread of diseases from person to person. Many students still go to school when they have a fever or are contagious, so video chatting would help lower these diseases from spreading due to the lack of physical communication from students. Not only does video chatting help limit the spread of disease and make up work, but it also helps prepare kids for the real world; college.

Distance learning will help students have an advantage in their college and professional lives when communicating with people all over the world. By allowing kids to try this during high school or throughout their education career, it would lead to a more successful college lifestyle. Students would already be acclimated to the types of online classes and work from their previous high school experience, so they would not have a dramatic shift in learning when they go to college. Not only would this give them an advantage in taking classes in college, but it would help to lower stress when transitioning into a new environment. Later in life they would be more prepared when they conference people online for business meetings or video conference online with people in different countries. Many business have relationships overseas that they use video conferencing for, so it would benefit these students to grow up with video conferencing being a form of communication. Distance learning will help give these kids an advantage and make their professional lives easier and more successful.

Students would develop greater social skills when learning through video conferencing with people all over the world. Online learning opens up many possibilities to many different types of people. By learning through video conferencing, it forces students to make bonds with their peers that they would not normally be in class with due to the distance apart. Online school provides different people the same opportunities to help get the same education. Many people believe that computers and online communication make it harder for kids to learn social skills today, but it actually does the opposite. The Internet and video conferencing give a whole new way of social communication because of the ability to talk with people from across the world. Although it is not the traditional type of social environment, it is still possible to make close bonds with peers that are experiencing different cultures, so you can learn about these different places in the world. Video conferencing in schools would help expose students to these different cultures and make them open to a diverse setting of learning.

This new type of schooling, video conferencing from home, would open up a new way of learning for students all over the world. It would help expose students to new opportunities that they would not normally get, like developing bonds with people far away, and it would help students attend school when they are sick or unable to get to the physical building. This new learning technique would prepare students for college and better them in the real world, only making them more successful. Although their are a few draw backs, like needing technology and certain social skills could be lost, it would end of making the new generation more successful and able to have conversations with different people from different backgrounds. In conclusion the new wave of distance learning would only be an advantage in the learning community. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
3E9AC2434A7F,"Select schools offer distance learning, a way of schooling in which the student is able to ""attend"" class through online or video conferencing, therefore, a student not able to attend school because of any situation may continue schooling and receive their education from any location or situation. This would benefit students with any medical issues, or family/home life issues; They could still continue schooling and receive their diploma without stepping foot inside a school building.

A child suffering from any physical or mental instabilities or frequenting hospital time would highly benefit from distance learning. A student should not feel the stress of falling behind in school or failing classes, when they should be focused on healing themselves and remaining healthy and happy. At no point in time should a student feel the need to put their own physical or mental well being aside so that their school work should survive. If a student has any issues such as needing to stay in hospital or home the online or video conferencing would be a way of continuing social contact in education, furthering education, but also extending brain development, and taking their minds off the present situation, which they most likely dont wish to be in. Of course in some medical emergencies or severe health situations there are complications by which distance learning would not work at all and continuing schooling wouldnt be first concern. Mind over matter in which, mind not only stands for its self but also the human body, and matter is anything other than that.

Many children suffer from problems not of the outside world but of issues that stem from their home environment and people contributing to their home life. In a situation where a child may live not in a location close to any schools, though rare, may happen because of a parent or guardians decision. A child may have to watch younger siblings or take care of grandparents, though social norms say a child not be put in such situations so that they may not attend school; But for some that is their way of life that family comes first, and that is the way that parents or guardian wish to raise their child. Or that a students parents live a life so that they move or travel frequently, because of a military career or government positioning. In these conditions the child should not be punished for their parent or guardians lifestyle or what they chooses to value, they should have a fair chance at schooling just as any other child receives.

Whenever you go up you always have to come back down in some way. Meaning that there is always cons or failures in this way of education. A student may cheat, because they have no educational instructor to watch over them as they do school work. Or that some students may take advantage of this program so that they dont have to go to school. But they are choosing their life in those moments and if a students wishes to cheat or not attend, when thrown into their future the only person that is hurting in the end is their selves. That is their decision and their education, and the program may then be giving them the biggest life lesson they would ever receive.

In the end I believe that the pros out weight the cons in the amount of students that this program would help and change their lives for the better, highly out weights those who would take advantage. You may watch a child who without the program would have never graduated high school or even middle school go on to do great things in life and thrive, because they were given a chance by the distance learning program.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
89593AEC5E89,"Many things today can be accomplished online without having to leave the comfort of your own home, including earning an education. Some schools currently offer distance learning to students, which is essentially attending classes from home through online classes or video conferencing. This method of learning has not yet been implemented into all schools, but it would benefit many students if it was. Offering students the option to partake in distance learning allows them to make the personal choice of what is most beneficial for them. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because distance learning may be the most covenant option for their circumstances, it would allow them to choose the learning environment that is most effective for them, and it would urge students to take on the responsibility of completing more independent work at their own pace.

Being able to attend classes from home would be beneficial to students because distance learning may be the most covenant option for their circumstances. Students have different conflicts they deal with when it comes to school, and distance learning is a solution that would make attending classes more flexible for students. It would be very beneficial to some specific students if they could choose to take classes at home. Specific examples of this are a student who has a long commute to school, a student who has young siblings that they need to watch over at home, or a student who is too injured to comfortably leave their home. In all of these scenarios it would be a covenant option for the students to take classes from home. Students should have the option to attend classes from home because it would provide them with an alternative choice that could be more covenant for them, therefore benefit them greatly.

Another benefit of students having the ability to choose distance learning, is it would allow them to choose the learning environment that is most effective for them. Not every student does well learning in a classroom setting, many happen to do their best work outside of school. The busy commotion of some classrooms produce a variety of learning difficulties for certain students. Some classrooms are filled with talkative students that may disrupt the well behaved students who are trying to learn. Other times, the problem may be a sociable student who is having a difficult time being productive in a classroom filled with social distractions, or a student who faces social anxiety that causes them to have issues learning in class. Some students that face difficulties like these in a classroom setting may prefer to learn in a different environment. Such as a student choosing to learn quietly at home with less social distractions, or a student choosing to work outdoors to calm their anxiety. If students were given the option of distance learning they could make the choice to attend classes from home, or anywhere else that would be most beneficial to their learning needs.

Some may argue that if students were able to attend classes from home it would not benefit them since they would not be receiving the constant guidance and help that they would from a teacher in a classroom. With less frequent guidance from a teacher in a classroom, students would have to work independently more often. However, having to work independently would ultimately benefit students because it would cause them to become more responsible. Students would have to be responsible for completing their classes at home on their own time. Although students would be more independent with distance learning, they would still have a teacher for their online class that they could contact about questions they have from home. While not being in a classroom with a teacher may be a change that would take time for some students to get used to, it would not be an issue for some. Not every student needs as much assistance as others, some are quick learners that would rather learn at their own pace without a teacher helping them along every step. If students were able to choose distance learning, it would benefit them by influencing them to take on responsibility through more independent learning and working at their own pace.

In conclusion, being a covenant option for some students' circumstances, allowing students to choose the learning environment that is most effective for them, and causing students to take on responsibility through more independent learning are the reasons why students would benefit from distance learning and why it is a beneficial option to provide. Whether or not distance learning would be beneficial for an individual student depends entirely on the student's circumstances, preferences, and needs. Every student learns differently and works better in different scenarios or environments, therefore attending classes from home would not affect every student the same. What may be the best option for one student, may not be the best for another. Every student should be given the opportunity to partake in distance learning if they decide it is the most beneficial option for them and improving their education. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
30FB93559E6F,"Some schools provide distance learning by home or by going to school and getting the information in class. In other words, I believe that learning in class is more efficient. Some might believe that learning by distance is better because they can stay at home and do the work. They believe this because its probably easier for them, or they don't want to learn it in class. I believe that learning in class, at school is better because some students may have small group classes, It is easier to understand the information the teachers give us, and teachers will physically be with you while you learn the information in class.

The first reason is that some students may have small group classes. For example, if youre a students that takes a small class it would be better for you to learn it in class because its makes the information much easier. This means that the information you receive will be more efficient and understanding. Another example is that students in small group classes may be in that class because when they are learning at school with everything about the subject in the room they may find it easier. This conveys that being in a small group class is better than learning in a video conference, for some students.

Secondly, it is easier to understand the information that the teachers gives us. For example, being in a video conference wont let you get extra information by the teacher. This is important to note because what if you dont understand the subject and that teacher isnt their to help you because the class has ended. Another example is, while the students are at home they can get distracted or zoned out while the teacher is explaining the information to them, so the teacher will have to re explain the whole lesson to them. In other words, this means that the students will have to learn the lesson again.

The third reason is that the teachers will physically be there while the students are working. For example, imagine students in a classroom with a teacher that is there to help them understand and work through the lesson, while a student is home learning. The students wont be able to ask the teacher for extra information about the lesson, instead they will have to figure it out themselves. This proves that being in a class room with a teacher in the room will be more efficient and helpful. The last example is if student has a very important question they need to ask the teacher and the video conference has ended the student needs to find a way top contact them, so they can answer their important question on the lesson. This proves that if a student needs more information or they have extra questions they wont be able to ask the teacher without another way of contact.

In conclusion, learning at school more efficient and important than learning from behind a screen. I still believe that is easier to work in class because some students may have small group classes, It is easier to understand the information the teacher give us, and teachers will be with you during the class. Others may still believe that learning from home is better for them because they can take information in that way, but learning in class, at school is very important and better for your brain.   ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
27B51EEF47E7,"Distance learning is described as a way for students to be able to attend classes while still being at home through online and/or video conferencing. This means that students could still get the same information they would if they were actually present in the classroom, which is something most students really need sometimes. Having another way of teaching students that could not be present in the classroom that day lessens the chance of those students being behind, which also keeps their grades up.

Distance learning is simply just another tool at students disposal to help them be successful in school at all times. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home via online or video conferencing because students not able to come to school for periods of time can still get information, there would be less distractions at home compared to the classroom environment, and students will have more motivation and energy to learn.

If distance learning becomes a thing, students not able to come to school can still learn what they would've missed. If a student is absent from school for long periods of time due to being sick, suspended, or out of town, and then come back the next day, they have missed tons of information and their grades drop dramatically. Being able to access the live teachings of their teachers when they are not at school definitely avoids the issue of coming back to school and being confused on the material. Especially in challenging classes like math, science, and world languages, being behind greatly affects the student's ability to do well in the class after missing important chunks of information. Even if the student is still confused while watching the live teachings of their teacher, the online conferencing should allow the student to ask the teacher questions while they are teaching to clarify any confusion, just like any student that is actually present in the class.

Often in the classroom environment, there are a lot of things going on that are distractions. Classmates and technology are just naming a few of them. Live distractions make it even harder for students to focus and concentrate on their classwork. For example, when I have a class with a friend, I often tend to talk to them way more than I should and also be less focused on doing my work. Getting distracted by friends when I should be doing my work definitely makes me more unprepared for tests and makes my work very unpolished. Being able to listen to a teacher lecture and do the classwork from home makes it easier to focus and produce quality work.

Lastly, students will have more motivation and energy to learn if they are able to do it from home too. Waking up everyday 5 days a week at 5 a. m in the morning, getting dressed, stressing over bringing the right homework, and catching the bus at the right time can get old and tiring very fast. Most of the time, it is a real struggle to even get out of bed for some students. Not all people thrive when being forced in a routine that is hard to function in, so distance learning gives people who function differently the option to stay home and also learn the same material as the people present in the classroom. Some people may argue that distance learning would not be a good thing because it could result in laziness among students that choose to learn that way, however, distance learning would actually teach participating students to be more independent and responsible over their schoolwork, which could prepare them for college. Learning from home is up to the student's maturity level because they need to be able to take initiative on their own work without a teacher being there to tell them to.

Distance learning would benefit students looking to attend classes from home because missing school can affect the student negatively, there are less distractions in a home environment rather than a classroom environment, and learning from home may cause the student to function better.

Being able to learn the same material at home that is being taught at school is very beneficial and can also help students who actually need it be successful in school. It should be all schools' duty to create different ways of learning to accompany all the different students, for everyone is not the same. Learning from home would be a good idea that would help students thrive, rather than forcing everyone to learn the same. The option of distance learning is a great way to help ensure all students success. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
FAC1A3B4097F,"I do not believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is many reasons why most schools do not offer distance learning. For instance, students will get less interaction with other friends and peers because they are at home instead of being in a classroom at school. Also, most students like to learn new up close and interactively, the polar opposite of distance learning. Finally, another reason for why most schools do not offer distance learning is because too many thing are out of the student's control, like power outages from a bad storm, which a student cannot control.

It is very common to hear doctors speak about having a decent amount of interaction with students and how healthy interacting is for a person. So, why would a school hinder a student's ability to interact with peers by using distance learning? Distance learning is very negligent to a necessity in a young student's life, which is the ability to interact. Instead of being in a classroom with 20 other students, a student is inside of a house staring at a computer screen nonstop for 7 hours daily.

In a scientific study by Xavier College, it is said over 69% of students in high schools across America preferred hands-on learning over any other type of learning. The reason for that is simple, teachers who interact while involving students in classrooms get through a student's head and makes him/her understand a concept better. Distance learning however, is the exact opposite of hands-on learning, and doesn't stick and get in the brain like hands-on learning does. Mainly because of it's inability to make a student want to be excited to learn a new concept.

The biggest factor over schools choosing to do distance learning is clear, and that is the unreliable nature and overall risk of online learning. Often times, a student is not even in control of a situation that can disrupt a online learning session. For example, a bad storm can hit during a video conference and shut off your power, once that happens, what do you do? Wait for an indefinite time for your power to come back to your house? That would be ridiculous. Another possibility is your computer having issues and not being able to use it, it's hard to say what any school offering online courses would do in that situation. but it seems far to likely to occur. The risk is stacked against schools when they have very likely possibilities that can happen to a student and their learning. Also, relying on a student when most are not the most responsible and mature yet is a bad idea.

In conclusion, I do not believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. online learning is just too risky and overall not very effective when compared to tried-and-true methods of teaching like hands-on teaching. Also, it takes a toll on a student mentally because they have less time to hang out and interact with peers. In a school's viewpoint, doing online schooling is a waste of time and money, especially compared to an actual school a student can go to, which keep in mind is more effective than distance learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
3E447261F53A,"Online classes are becoming a huge deal not only in colleges, but also public high schools. Many high schools offer courses for students who wish to get ahead of the regular program. Here at Generic_School we have online PE, economics, and online AP classes. Schools should provide online class opportunities for students because of students who wish to get ahead, students who want to work, and students who do extra curricular activities., and students with social anxiety.

To start, schools that offer online education will be helping advanced students load up on classes. Many students want to get as many AP and honor classes out of the way before senior year, not only to help their GPA, but also to leave room for electives. At Generic_School many students take this opportunity and take online AP classes. My friend Generic_Name is a perfect example, she takes AP Mandarin. Generic_Name will have an amazing record for colleges, they will take notice of her diligence and if they had to pick between two students, the college will pick her. Online courses will also provide a chance for students to raise their GPA's. Grade point averages are very important and can determine who can get a scholarship and who can not. To conclude, online classes are a good opportunity for students to pull ahead.

Another point is that students who want jobs will not be limited by school. Many students who are just turning sixteen are ready to earn money, but they are limited by how many hours they can work. Students who are provided with a chance to take some courses online will have more hours to work. Being able to work will help high school students get needed work experience and help teenagers learn how to appreciate money. Students can also learn valuable time management skills that will definitely help later on in life. My brother, who graduated last year, learned how to balance a work life on top of other projects. Cross learned that he must find the equilibrium between his schoolwork and his job. The job he had helped him pay for many of the fun opportunities that his school provided, like field trips, class rings, and prom. In summary, schools should help out students who want to work by giving them a chance to do some classes at home.

Another reason why students should be provided a chance to take online classes is because of anxiety. Social anxiety makes it hard for people to talk to other, be in crowded areas, and function like others. Students with anxiety might find it hard to take tests like other students and may fall behind in academics. Schools should provide them with an opportunity to take their courses at home, where they feel most comfortable. This could raise their GPA's and help their mental health. These students may find it difficult to go through crowded hallways and classrooms, they might have trouble asking to go to the bathroom, or trow away their trash. This becomes a major problem when these students have do solo presentations. Students who can barely maintain eye contact for more than three seconds have to get up in front of their peers and presents a project by their self. To finish, students wit anxiety should have an equal opportunity to pass school.

Finally, schools should help students who want to do extra curricular activities. School clubs and sports are incredibly important to a students everyday life. A students who plays soccer might need more time to practice, but can not leave class. Generic_School always says that, students who do sports and clubs have a higher GPA. Not only do students do school activities, but also Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Dance, and take music lessons. I know my day would be so much easier if I could go home early to practice a piece or two before I head to my piano class. I would not be limited to the short 30 minutes that I usually get. For example, I get home around 5:00 pm, then I must do homework, eat, and practice my recital pieces before my lesson. If I could go home, do a quick lesson and then practice as much as possible, my teacher would be impresses. To conclude, students will get more time for their activities.

In conclusion, online course would help students by providing them with many opportunities that would not have otherwise. Students who can get extra practice for their sport will have a better chance of making the team, and drama students will have more time to memorize their lines. Some may say that students who take online courses will forget to do their work, this is false because the consequences of not doing the work would effect everything in their life. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
D140D284B493,"No,students would not benefit from being able to take classes from home because students need more of a structured classroom setting to achieve academic goals,some students will not do the work,and some kids need more 101 time with teachers so they can visualize and see how the work should be done.

Studies have shown that most students need to be in a structured setting with teachers in order to succeed in their academic career. The reasons why students need more of a structured setting is because at home you have no one watching over you and there to help you with your work. Which in some cases is bad because students can and will easily get side tracked and put down the computer and start doing other things or looking at other websites while they should be working on their school work. Also some students may not understand something and not try to seek help for them to better understand it therefor they will just chose to not work on the work because,they are overwhelmed and cannot figure out how to do the work. If the students were to be in a classroom and didnt understand they have one or sometimes multiple teachers in their classroom to help them guide them on how to do the work.

Some students may choose just to not work on their work because they dont feel like it, or they could simply just choose to sleep because they are tired from staying up at night because, they knew that they did not have to wake up early in the morning to attend school. Then when parents or guardians find out that the students havent been working on their work they will be forced to do it. It will be very hard for them to do the work because they are already so far behind which means in some cases they may not finish the class by the time the class is over. Online also isnt the best because when kids finally do decide to do the work the can just look up all the answers to the questions and pass the class with a passing grade but in reality they dont actually know anything because they looked up all the answers which isnt benefiting them and preparing them for the future at all.

Other students may need more 101 and directional time from teachers in order to do good in their academics. Being in a classroom and being able to depend on the teacher to help you when you need it is a very big advocate. Students might need teachers to be on them or simply just to guide then and tell them to do their work and other things to keep them on task and do all of their work in a timely manor so they will be on track to graduate on time and take what they have learned in high school onto college.

With all the information i have gathered about online classes i dont think they are the best choice for most kids because of the lack or classroom structure, not doing it, and lack of 101 time with teachers. Those are al0l traits of failing a class and not getting any valuable information from the class.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
5E8B50F6DF84,"Going to school everyday can be stressful and overwhelming. Most students dread going to school, whether its because of social situations, or personal reasons. They wake up in the morning and wish they could stay home but they know they can't because they can't miss class and they know that they would have so much makeup work. Having the choice to attend class from home would be very beneficial to students because working from home means a different environment, learning style, and schedule which can be a healthier way of learning.

The environment in school can be a little overwhelming and distracting. Each classroom is filled with so many students all talking and having their own opinion which can be a little crazy. The teachers do not always help either, sometimes they even make it worse. Personally, when I wake up I have that one class that I dread going to, its not because I hate the subject, but its because the teacher and my classmates make it hard for me to focus and want to get my work done. The teacher doesn't do anything but lecture and he gives so much work at once to where I feel so overwhelmed and annoyed because I can not focus in that class. I get very frustrated because I love math but I can not get my work done in that class with the teacher going on and on about a new unit which he isnt explaining well at all and the students all talking to the top of their lungs. At home the environment is totally different, where the student can get their work done on their own and in peace. Some people like it better on their own away from all the distractions of others and stuck in a building all day. Working from home is a better environment and being able to learn your own way can be so helpful.

Everybody has a style of learning that works best for them but not all teachers teach the best way for the students. Most teachers only teach one way of teaching which is usually lecture, while that may work great for some students it doesn't work great for all. I am personally more a hands-on or reading student, most teachers don't teach with either those. With working at home the student can see which truly works for them and can learn in different ways. While some teachers have the best intentions for their students some do not. It is sad to say that not every teacher wants their students to do well but it is true. At school if the teacher does not like a student they can be biased towards their grading, but if the student were to work at home their would be no chance if bias. Taking classes from home is a huge advantage for those they get affected by their teachers opinions. The student can see what way of learning works best for them and see when it works best fro them in their daily schedule.

In high school a students schedule can be a little overwhelming and very hard to mange. While some people may say that the teenage years is when you learn time management isnt wrong, but should be to an extent. Teenagers should not be so stressed out with everything going on to where they get depression or bad thoughts due to all the work and other activities going on. A student could have so many things going on such as sports, extra curricular, work, a long day at school, and hours of homework. Teenagers should have time to enjoy themselves and do things that interest them, rather then homework and school taking up majority of their time. Doing class from home could be very beneficial fro those who play sports or have a job because you can schedule the classwork around those activities. Planning the day out with what work you have to get done from home and then the other actives would be less stressful than not being able to plan out your day and only have 30 minutes if your own time. Being able to work from home would be a huge positive for those students having so much on their plate it would take out a lot of the stress in their lives.

Overall, attending class from home would benefit those students who need a better leaning environment, to make their own schedule, and to have a different way of learning. Having the chance to change the way of learning could have a huge impact on how everyone would be able to learn the way they want to learn. So many factors at school can also weigh into a students life and can impact them in a negative way. Having that option for those students who have had bad experiences at school would be so helpful to them. Every student should have the oppruninty to attend class at home and see if it makes a change in the way students learn today.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
9420CADEF8F6,"Education has been taught through traditional classroom settings for centuries.

The moment that school bell rings to signal the start of the school day, students prepare for their day of learning. Without that important aspect of education, students can slack off.

With video conferencing, the students are in a place they consider to be relaxing.

The attempt to learn through a video conference at home would not be time spent well by the students.

Most people wouldn't take the situation seriously and proceed to fool around.

Students would not benefit from online conferencing at home because of the ambiance of the school that provides students with an environment meant for learning, the social interactions that are created with fellow peers, and the idea that the method can be taken advantage of.

School is a location where students spend roughly six hours learning and an hour for walking to class and lunch time in Generic_City.

The environment contributes greatly to the likelihood that students want to learn while they are at school.

Especially since technology has advanced so much in the last couple of decades, teachers can teach students in many unique ways.

That face-to-face interaction with the teacher can help students learn in depth rather than staring at a computer screen.

People value experiences where they were taught something magnificent and the feeling that resulted while sitting in that classroom. That feeling will never be able to replicate from a student starting at a computer.

There was this moment in class when I really thought that this teacher had a great ability to teach and cared how her students were absorbing the information and not just memorizing for an exam.

My science teacher in seventh grade spent time making foldables, activities, and experiments that were not only interesting, but related to the topic that we were learning.

She taught us a lesson every class that could be used when we enter the reality of life after college. One time we were learning about the history of DNA.

She spoke of how a female scientist died not knowing that her discovery in science became historic in the development of other topics.

She noticed the connection that people were mistreated and advised us all to be aware that in the real world, ideas are stolen, but we should advocate for the truth.

Every student in Generic_City has heard of a PBL (Project Based Learning).

Administrators of public schools have implemented these assignments that require the effort of multiple people working together to come up with an amazing result.

If the Board of Education cares so deeply about the benefits of students working together, so should we.

With the online conferencing method of learning, students wouldn't have that interaction that is so crucial to work in the real world.

During these PBLs, students learn to compromise, share ideas, and work through disagreements.

These experiences come in handy when at work someone is placed in a group that they don't know and is expected to work together to find a solution for a problem. Recently, the Corona Virus (COVID-19) has become one of the most deadly diseases historically.

Scientists, from all over the world, have banded together in an attempt to find something that would help slow down the transmission of the disease or even a working cure.

The message of teamwork and collaboration is an idea that has been stressed for decades.

For example, during WWII, the atomic bomb was in the midst of its creation.

The Allies (U.S., Britain, France, etc.) sent over their scientists to the U.S. to work on the Manhattan project; a project that's goal was the creation of an atomic bomb.

Collaboration in the educational environment can't be substituted by a video on a computer screen.

Anything that requires technology can be manipulated.

The idea of online conferencing could be done, but the actual use of it wouldn't accomplish anything.

In order of getting out of school (online conferencing), students could think of a million reasons why they weren't there for their online conferencing. This could include losing their computer, not having internet, being busy for some reason, and etc. It's complicated enough that some students can leave during the school day, but this online conferencing would give students even more leeway to get out of their education.

People agree that in some circumstances, students can't physically be able to attend school. Whether there was an accident or a student was sick and contagious for weeks, maybe online conferencing would benefit them.

In the past, before online conferencing was suggested, schools have already dealt with this issue.

Usually, students will get their work ahead of time or periodically and then when they are able to return to school, they catch up with the teacher's assistance.

In the end, that person should recover nicely.

Once my friend was sick on and off for three weeks. She was taking four college level classes and three advanced classes. When she was at home, she took the initiative to tell all her teachers and get the work. Sometimes, I would call her and ask if she needed me to explain anything.

The traditional way to learn is perfectly fine for students.

All situations can be resolved to help a student that's facing hardships. Some college students have mentioned that nine out of ten times, high school was an experience they wouldn't trade for anything else, even with the bad times.

Those memories of attending school events like pep rallies, homecoming, prom, game nights and more wouldn't have even happened without traditional education.

The connections that are forged including friendships and romance. All of those are created because education was made to be a creative environment where students learn and are happily doing so.

The benefits of a traditional learning environment clearly outweigh learning through a computer screen. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
8498B3A8642D,"In today's modern world, there has been technological advancements that have made attending classes from home both beneficial and effective, by the use of online programs or video conferencing. Students would benefit greatly from being able to attend classes from home because it would give students who are ill and unable to attend school due to their sickness an opportunity to continue their education, there are less distractions at home, and it allows students to learn at their own pace.

Students who are ill and have to be hospitalized or on bed rest for an extended period of time, often are unable to continue most of the activities they may have been able to do prior to their sickness. By having online school, it would open a door for these students to be able to continue their education and not have to put their life on hold because of their conditions. I personally know what it is like to observe someone who had to stop attending his regular classes at school and switch to online classes, due to cancer. My cousin Generic_Name, was diagnosed with brain cancer when he was around the age of 12, and had to refrain from attending his local school, due to how severe his conditions became. Generic_Name was someone who loved school and had big dreams of becoming an engineer. However, his sickness did not stop him from persuing this life long goal; instead, he enrolled in online courses with his school and continued to take the classes he loved and made his time in the hospital feel like it was going by much faster. Online school will benefit ill students by improving their mental health, keeping them on track with graduation, and keep their mind off any treatment they are going through at the time.

Disractions are something that make it difficult for a student to learn, and often take them off task as to what they are supposed to be doing. I have experienced this in many of my classes over the years. For example, In my math class I sit next to my teachers desk, and there are a few students who come in during notes from previous blocks to try and understand the concept better. However, they whisper and chat during notes and it becomes difficult for me to direct my attention at the board. My attention becomes directed to what they are saying and I lose track of what was going on in the lesson being taught to me. This is a frequently occurring situation and after discussing it with other students who sit near by, they agreed it was distracting to them as well. To avoid situations like that, online school is a perfect solution. It provides students the option to choose where they want their learning enviornment to be and who they put themselves around. At home, students have the full individed attention of their teacher, which allows for them to ask questions and get one-on-one explanations of topics they may be confused on.

Often, teachers go at their own pace of teaching and do not take into consideration if each student is retaining the information at the pace they are teaching. In some cases, the teacher is going too slow and the information has then become boring to the students, and in others, the teacher is going too fast and the information has become jumbled and confusing to the students. However, this issue can be avoided by switching or starting out with online school. This gives students the chance to choose how long they spend each day learning a certain topic, and allows for them enough time to retain the information properly. Online school also allows for flexibility in a student's schedule by choosing when you start and stop your lessons each day, and how many hours each week a student chooses to complete.

However, choosing to attend online school will not guarantee a distraction free zone, instead it will just allow students to work in an area of their choosing and at their own pace. By letting online students work at their own pace, it could cause them to fall behind in their work each week if they choose to not participate in their daily lessons. Some students lack motivation and will choose to not do their daily tasks, which could result in graduating late or having to do classes over the summer. Each student who attends online school should make sure they are responsible for being on top of their work each day, especially since there is no teacher to physically remind them to turn in assignments.

Overall, students will benefit more from online school than they would by attending in-person classes. In society today, technology plays a significant role and is used in student's everyday lives. By having online classes, it would allow students to become more familiar with online programs and not rely so much on a teacher to physically be there to teach a lesson. Video conferencing is a creative way of learning and gives students the one-on-one attention that they would not get in a classroom. Online school is an innovative and interactive way of learning and would benefit ill students who are unable to attend class due to their sickness, provide a comfortable and less distractive learning enviornment, and allow students to work at their own pace. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
314A073FF242,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? students have their own way on learning, in school and at home. Students still should attend school for valuable reasons.

Students can get more help and experience at school than home. I know some students have different ways of learning, but its way better to get more hands on than seeing it online. Students wouldn't have interactions with teachers or students. Being social is good and communication is key in today's society. Students voices should be heard and how you going to do that if your doing online classes. Some kids have trouble some time speaking or afraid to speak to some people, but school is a place where you can speak your mind and have an opinion on things and get help so you could be heard.

Hands on is important so you can have an experience. Instead of just seeing it and observing it you be can doing it yourself so you can learn how to do things in life. School has many things so you can be prepare for the real world. Like high school, you have multiple schools that does hands on like carpentry, cooking , doing hair , and child and development. All of this is in school so you can have an experience on what you want to do or want to learn in life. I rather have hands on so I can learn how to do it instead later on in life I'm not struggling doing what could been taught in front of me.

You have to take some things for granted because a lot of people don't get the chance to go to school and do these type of things. I don't like school, but I rather be here getting my education than be home doing nothing watching time go by. Take this for granted because one day you want the best for your kids and want them to learn and be successful in life and be their own boss. School in important can' t stress it enough. Looking at a screen is not going to help get the actually help you need.

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? students have their own way on learning, in school and at home. Students still should attend school for valuable reasons. Students can get more help and experience at school than home.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
AE6BE874B204,"Did any of the schools you attended as a child offer distance learning? Would you be interested in participating in distance learning? Schools are now offering distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools believe that there are benefits to distance learning, however there are various problems with the system of distance learning. Distance learning is not beneficial for students because it will not prepare them for the set up of college, they are not going to be able to interact or learn how to work with their peers, and they are more likely to get easily distracted when learning from home.

One way that distance learning would not be beneficial for students is because it will not prepare them for the set up of college. In almost all colleges, the classes offered are in large lecture halls where you are face to face with the teacher and other students, and not separated by a screen. By participating in distance learning students may not be prepared for face to face interaction with their teacher and the other students. For example, my brother, who is now a senior in college, participated in a system similar to distance learning while he was in school. After having participated in online and video conferencing classes for almost all of his school career, he had a much harder time adjusting to the college style of teaching than the other students, from his same high school, that did not participate in distance learning. Another way that distance learning would not help students prepare for the set up of college is that the students that participate in distance learning will have trouble adjusting to having to leave their house to attend class. In college classes are not offered inside of dorms and students will have to travel outside of their living area. If students do not practice taking classes outside of their home in high school they may feel uncomfortable learning in an unfamiliar environment and that could affect their learning abilities when they get to college.

Another downside to the distance learning system is that students would not have daily interaction or learn how to work with their peers. In school you meet many new people from around your town that may have very different cultural or ethnic backgrounds. If students were to participate in distance learning, although they would meet various other peers through activities like sports, clubs, or their hobbies, they would not meet as many people as they would if they were also in a classroom with twenty to thirty other kids. Because of this limited interaction with other kids their age, these students who participate in distance learning may not learn how to interact and collaborate with other students. For example, my brother had a difficult time making friends in college because he had little experience interacting with other children that he didn't already know and have a relationship with. He also struggled in group projects because he had not participated in one since elementary school, when he began distance learning. Not learning how to collaborate with others can be detrimental for a student because that will be a major part of their lives after they finish school. Whether they use the skill of interacting with other people in their future job, or even just to make to new friends after moving to a new town, the skill of interacting with others is very valuable and important to possess.

The final reason that distance learning is not beneficial to students is because it allows students to become more easily distracted. In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.

Distance learning is not beneficial to students because it does not prepare them for the set up of college, they would not be able to learn how to interact and collaborate with their peers, and they are more likely to be easily distracted when learning from home. Although distance learning may provide some benefits to learners who may struggle with learning in a classroom setting, it will ultimately affect them in a negative way in the future. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
008015604AA0,"Distance learning provides an opportunity for students to learn from a comfortable space at home or on the go. Students who are unable, or not comfortable with traditional education in the classroom have a new alternative that gives them a chance that they have not had before. Students can learn more conveniently for their busy schedules from having to go to school, sports, and other extracurricular activities. This helps many who were originally not able to get an education due to the fact that a traditional classroom was unfit for them and their lifestyle. Distance learning provides students with a convenient learning pace, gets parents involved, and a flexible schedule.

Online schooling gives students the opportunity to learn at their own pace. Students who learn in the traditional classroom must learn at the pace at which the teacher has set and due to this some students are left behind and are unable to learn at that pace. With online schooling students get to set their own pace and are more comfortable with their learning experience. At the pace students have set for themselves this decreases the stress on the student and greatly improves their mental health. The improved mental health helps with many other things in the student's education such as behavior and exam scores.

A benefit of learning from home is the increased parent involvement. This benefits the student because if the student needs any help with their schoolwork they can go to a parent for help. With a flexible schedule the parent can help their child at anytime and it becomes much easier for parents to get involved in their child's education. This way the parents get to comprehend what their child is struggling to understand and they are in a better position to help them overcome the challenge. The student does not have to go through the struggles of learning on their own and the parent gets a better understanding of the child's learning capability and where their strengths and weaknesses are.

Although there are downsides to learning from home. While the students are home the opportunity to cheat is much higher since at home there are no teachers constantly monitoring the students work and progress. This creates a very big issue and students are more prone to looking up answers to an exam on another device. Schooling from home also causes the students to miss out on social interaction and the student is less likely to develop friendships and relationships. This takes a heavy toll on the students social and communication skills that will be needed later on.

Distance learning has many benefits such as flexible schedules and the opportunity to seek help from a parent or other family member. Although there are cons to online schooling the benefits greatly outweigh the cons that come with distance or online schooling. The mental health benefits alone are a great benefit that come with distance schooling. This way of learning has students learning in a place that the student is familiar with. learning in a familiar place reduces stress and greatly improves quiz and test scores.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4332C80A5690,"I do not think students will benefit from attending class from home because even though it may seem easier and more fun students will be missing various skill that can be only be gained in school,and they will face other obstacles along the way like:procrastination,lack of peer resources,and loss of hands on experience.

Students who attend classes from home will be in the comfort of their home which is the exact reason it wont benefit them. Being in the comfort of your home will tempt students to loose track and not stay focused while in a school environment there are teachers who make that task almost impossible. Also,students who take school from home will procrastinate much more because of the fact that there arent technically any peers to help them get back on track.

Which me brings me to my next point ,peers. They are a fundamental part of life, they help us and change us to be a better person,but for students who take school from home they lack the support of peers and teachers. Which ultimately leaves them out of the experience of a real life scenario because in real life you will be surrounded by people and wont be in the comfort of your home. School has the ability to teach you those skills you need when you grow up, and in school they not only teach you the skills but make you apply them in the school environment which leads you to be better prepared in the future.

That brings me to my final point which is students being prepared for the future. Students who take in school classes learn necessary skills that they will use throughout their life;for example,public speaking,social conduct,and time management. These are important skills that students can only learn in school and students take online school will be missing out on these benefits because with online school your only interaction is with a computer screen which gives you no no life skills whatsoever. Students who take online school gain no benefit from it because it offers no vial skill ; the only skill they can gain is following textbook concept tutorials that have no emotion behind them(another lack of peer resource).

Ultimately,online class may seem like a better alternative but the cons clearly outweigh the pros leaving you with nothing but a screen to look at and a future that you arent ready for.             ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
93385DED39E7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didn't get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didn't had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning.

The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general.

Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.

Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.

For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.

One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.

On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.

In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6ECEC81235E5,"The most beneficial tool the education system could possibly provide for our students would be the opportunity to attend class from home. Distance learning not only benefits students with active schedules, but it also allows students to control their academic environment, and with this resource students are able to learn at their own pace.

Students with active schedules gain an advantage from using distance learning because, this resource aids students with time management. A national study has provided evidence showing that eighty percent of all high school students participating in sports, art and music programs, or enrolled in advance placement classes are not always able to handle the workload, often times being strained and unmotivated from this daily challenge. This research is ultimately proof that there is a need for outside materials to eliminate this problem, and distance learning provides the solution. With distance learning the students can take some of their core classes via online, or even through video chats teachers can upload, giving the students more relaxed schedules during the school day offering them time to focus on their other activities and classes they may throughout the day; turning the once stressed out teenagers struggling with academics into powerhouses of success.

Being able to have choices and control the settings around you is something we as humans do in society everyday, whether it be from choosing to sit at a booth over a table in a restaurant because you dont like being close to crowds, or even deciding to drink Starbucks instead of McDonald coffee. So why not apply the same concept with Education. Students should be able to control their learning environment and distance learning allows them to make those choices. School is considered very stressful for the young minds of today, not only that but having the same routine every day for ten consecutive months has proven to make students learning experience depressing, and mentally taxing. When students are capable of changing their learning environment they become reengaged with the material and not bored with the same scenery. For example, a local school district offers a distance learning program where students can take the core classes they would normally have at school and take it online, many of the students who have overwhelming schedules decided to use the distance learning resource and completely fell in love with it, the ability to take their work somewhere outside of school made it easier for the students to focus and was described as an answer to their academic prayers, showing that this tool is beneficial, and can really enhance a students learning experience.

Distance learning can serve as an outlet for those who struggle with keeping up with the speed of the class material in school, letting them complete their work at a pace thats beneficial to their independent needs. When asked, students agreed that they often struggle with following the class lectures and completing classwork in a sufficient time, resulting in their overall class grades plummeting into the educational abyss of no return. If the students were given distance learning they could easily space out their new online assignments to match their needs and various levels of understanding. No one student is alike, they are all unique individuals; an amaing solution such as distance learning meets the need of every student, allowing them to reach their goals at their own pace.

Finally, We know that students would benefit immensely from this academic gold mine. Although, others might be reluctant to this idea and say that students are better off working entirely from school, or that school work should stay at school they are entirely incorrect. Students prosper most from distance learning because it provides as an outlet for students with demanding schedules, Students can control their learning environment, and last but certainly not least, distance learning allows students to learn at a pace thats best for them. As a final thought, just remember the students of now are our future and we should utilize the best tools possible for their success, anything else would be a disservice, prohibiting them from reaching academic success.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

998E0F68318B,"Distance Learning: the Solution

While walking the halls of a high school building during the winter, one can hear sneezing, coughing, and the constant blowing of noses. Students walk the halls half dead and slouched over. They come to school sick because missing a day of school can be catastrophic to their grades. In the past 40 or so years, most high school students have gone from taking one or two AP level courses, to six or seven. These fast paced classes can do wonders for a grade point average, or they can ruin it. AP classes are so fast paced, missing a day of school means missing vital learning time. By the time sick students get back on their feet, their class has probably moved on to another unit. A solution to this problem? Distance learning. Providing students with a way to take classes from home would reduce the amount of sick students in school and help them to stay on task, no matter their location while giving them more time to do the things they enjoy.

Schools have become cesspools for diseases like strep, the flu, and colds. Students come to school sick because they believe they have to, and in some cases they are right. Missing school means makeup work, which is a task most students would want to avoid. Having double the amount of work while simultaneously getting over an illness causes sleepless nights of stress and anxiety. As a way to avoid makeup work, students have started to come while sick. The sickness will spread throughout the school and cause outbreaks, more students will come sick to keep up with schoolwork. The best way to stop this is through distance learning. Through video chats students will be able to keep up with their learning and work while sick or injured. Distance learning will keep kids at home and the spread of germs will be stopped. Students will also no longer have to stay up late to teach themselves difficult material. Distance learning is the best solution to the epidemic of sick students in schools.

More time. That is something very student wants. Colleges are no longer looking for just good grades, they want someone who made varsity in their sport, is well rounded in their club choices, works a solid job, and has given back to their community. If you look at the average day of a high school student, you will see they start with morning club meetings, usually at 8 A.M, then at 9:15, about seven hours of school. At 4:03 P.M. most will go to athletic practice for three to four hours, they'll get home at 8 or 9 P.M. and then sit down with two to three hours of homework. They'll sleep at 12 A.M. or later and wake up at 7 A.M. the next day to do it all over again. Most will volunteer or go to a part time job over the weekend. So when exactly does a student have free time? The answer is easy. Never. Distance learning will solve that. Almost all students have a study hall during the day, an hour and a half to just do homework, through distance learning that study hall turns into an opportunity. Students could grab food with their friends, get ahead in their classes, hold club meetings online, or even get some rest. The format of distance learning allows students a more flexible schedule, they can sit in on a video chat while cleaning their room. Distance learning will help students to free up time out of their day and make them less stressed.

Some parents may argue that distance learning will cause students to become lazy and socially awkward. Attending school from home means students can sit in bed in their pajamas and work on assignments, and the lack of interaction between students will cause them to lose their social skills. Both of those ideas, however, are false. Most high school students do not put in the effort to dress nicely for school everyday already, they would rather be comfortable then look nice. Through video chatting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers, everyone needs social interaction and distance learning takes that into account. Many students find it easier to learn while sitting at a desk or table, both of which are very common in any household, therefore, students lazing around in bed while learning is highly unrealistic.

Distance learning is a solution to the large amount of sick students and high levels of stress. By giving them more free time and a place to work on school from home, distance learning allows students to have a more enjoyable school experience. Many students will agree that there is just not enough time in the day to get all their work done, distance learning will provide them with a way to adequately keep up with studies while giving them time to work on other tasks. Schools have progressed to become more difficult as time has passed, causing the systems to become outdated. Students are unhappy with the way schools are currently run, its time for a change.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

My position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level.

For example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge.

attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more.

When you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research. But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.

In my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For expample in my english class i pay attention at the class i can understand, and when i have a questions i ask my teacher to explaine for me.

I desagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you can't take it at home because you you need to worked like a groups. For example when i have work to do at schoul classroom's we work together to make the exrcises or a topic easy, and when you get absent and you left some works the teachers helping you to do it.

The schools classrooms programmes will help you about the time and they have specific time to work confortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings.

Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they will not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. For examlpe when you have to work on topic it will be hard for some students to understand more.

In my opinion for the students who prefer to attend school classroom's it's good decision, because they will have more infermations and more experience about the way to make a plan and more knowledge about the courses you taking at school.

CCF236C2E533,"The phrase ""home sweet home"" can mean many different things to many different people, however the one thing that all meanings have in common is the comfort of a home. Recently, schools have been offering students the ability to work from home, allowing them to complete work in an environment that may be more work friendly for some. The idea of this is quite simple, however the psychology is a different, much more complicated story. Utilizing this system, students would be allowed to stay home rather than attend school on a typical school day, and would video conference to attend their classes. This statistically backed spin on school attendance would be highly effective due to the personalized work environment it provides as well as the mental relief it offers students.

Students are all different, and thus have different preferences when it comes to work environment. Some students may work well in a quiet environment such as a library or a home, however in contrast some may actually work better in a noisy environment due either to preference, or due to ADHD or other similar mental disorders, which cause affected students to feel more comfortable with noise to keep them entertained. This same idea can be applied to many different situations such as comfy chairs and school chairs, large dasks and school desks, classrooms and bedrooms, and many, many more. Due to this large range of preferences, the option to let students choose to work from home is an exponentially good idea, as it gives students the option to work in and create an environment that is friendly to them and their preferences. Although students would still be attending the classes through thier computers, the stresses and boundaries of a typical school day would be eliminated, and students woud be able to relax knowing they're comfortable in their own home field.

A study done by one Generic_School that offers this program showed that active students in the ""Education in Bed"" program exhibited an 18% higher total Grade Point Average than active students attending school traditionally. Further research into this subject, done to uncover the reasons for this odd success, revealed that the biggest factor at play in this equation was stress. Stress levels in students attending school from home were way down, less than 1/4 of at home students reporting feeling overstressed while, when asked the same thing, more than 3/4 of students attending school traditionally claimed they felt this way. It is safe to say that the school at home method is a safe and easy way of eliminating stress in certain students, and can effectively boost grades for students willing to work hard even outside of school.

There are many things aside from learning that occur in school that can be mentally challenging for certain students. Bullying is one of these things; a big issue that not only affects mental health, but can also affect physical health if it gets bad enough. Bullied students need somewhere that they can work and learn while feeling safe and secure without the stresses and mental deterioration that bullying can cause. In this case, home is the perfect place. Utilizing the school at home system, these bullied students wouldn't have to be subject to the horrors they experience at school. Rather, they would be able to relax at home with no chance of being bullied. As for the bullies, well, instead of suspending them for being bullies, why not put them on a mandatory school at home schedule, where they are required to take part in school while they serve their temporary leave? Doing so would eliminate the issue of students getting a free weekend when suspended, turning suspensions into present and long term punishments, rather than just long term punishments that come to bite troublemakers in the backside once they decide to apply for college.

There are numerous benefits to implementing a policy allowing students to attend public school from home. Although it may seem like a small change, it makes a huge difference in the way students work and feel. If this system is implemented, there is a chance it will be abused, and punishments will have to me made with the goal of preventing abuse, however, this system will undoubtedly bring more good than bad. It acts as both a punishment for troublemakers and a retreat for students that are in need, and will bring a whole new aspect to any school it is implemented in. In turn, schools utilizing this strategy are able to spend less on supplies, act as a role model, and have light shined on them, possibly increasing funding that goes right back into improving the quality of school for students. Being able to have a home as a learning environment not only makes students comfortable with the space they are in, it makes them feel safe, mentally sound, less stressed, more productive, and so much more.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
3321A3E87AD3,"I do agree that some students would benefit from online classes, but not all of them would. There's people that learn better if they are in a classroom with a teacher standing in front of them. There's also people who struggle to listen correctly in the classroom. Those are the people that would heavily benefit from an online course. All of their distractions are eliminated and they can turn the volume up on their laptop if they struggle to listen. There are benefits from both being in a classroom and being in an online classroom.

Since I agree that some would benefit, let's talk about why it's only ""some"". If you are like me, you would rather be in a classroom with other students who are learning the same things as you. Therefore, you can ask them for help if you missed something or just have a conversation on the topic. Just talking to others about what you're learning will grow your knowledge on the subject and you might even teach them a thing or two. This will also give you a chance to talk with the beautiful girls in your class!

So, why are they both beneficial? I've never taken a class online, but it must be nice to bring the class wherever you want. So, if you're an on-the-go student, I would look into online courses. Anxiety is a big thing these days and I've heard of many people with ""classroom anxiety"". They are actually afraid to go to school and I cannot think of a better cure for that than online classes. On the other hand, people in the classroom can speak on the subject and teach each other new things as I said before. You have the luxury of asking the teacher for assistance. Being in a classroom also improves your people skills.

We all know there is good and bad that come from online courses. These are some reasons why people think there is no good coming from it. You may not get the full learning experience from looking at your laptop rather than having someone with all the answers speaking to you and making you write them down. You have no social life while you're learning and you can't speak with classmates to learn more or get answers for a homework. If you're online learning, everything is on you! There is little help that comes with online classes rather than a real classroom.

All in all, I agree that some students would benefit from online classes. Those who are very independent and portable would love online classes. I feel that there are more students who would rather stay in the classroom and converse to learn more. It's all about what each person prefers. Online courses are not for everyone but are definitely a great option.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
1B9E20C72CD3,"Many people believe schools are public or private institutions that provide numerous forms of educational fields. However, schools have developed ,along with the advancement of technology, producing a new offering of online classes and video conferencing. Many schools are opening highschoolers to online classes to raise GPAs and to have head starts to college. The production of online classes and video conferencing is beneficial ,while bringing opportunities to emit better choices taken upon education, and the ability to exceed learning levels.

For instance, students that decide to partake of online and video classes can pace themselves, in order to learn more at their own rates. Learning at your own pace, brings understanding of curriculum, as well as preparation for tests and quizzes. Where as, rushing a student can put them on track for lower grades, which leads to lowered GPAs and struggling in the future. With the aid of Video conferencing, the student could be taught step by step what they need to know by a tutor or teacher.

In addition, online and video classes have developed to an ability to bring classes on the travel. People have taken advantage of this strategy by taking technology; such as laptops, tablets, and phones, to Cafes and Libraries, in order to access the internet to finish class projects and study for tests. This strategy has helped people dedicate their use of free time to more school related purposes. Students are able to video conference a teacher or another student to catch up on missed lessons.

On the other hand, many individuals frown upon the influx of online classes. The public believes that many people have used online and video conference classes as a slacking tool. Media tries to persuade the Public, not to apply for online classes and video conferences believing that they are a waste of time, proving that that they will not challenge you. Those people don't understand that slacking in an online class can affect your transcript, because your grade can constantly go down. Also, some schools require certain GPA's to take Standardized tests, in order to decide, if the student qualifies or not. In many cases, people rephrase from failing online and video courses, because the teachers or providers of the lessons tend to be a little harder on the student than normal teachers.

In Conclusion, more schools should offer the ability to sign up for online classes and video conferencing. The use of these new forms of teaching could help students acquire more focus towards education. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Attending to school can have a huge impact in your life. How would it affect you, if you don't atten to school?. would it be the same if you learn all the materials by watching videos?. would you be able to ask questions just the same way other students do?. Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future. For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video can't give you enough information, for you to know the story. a video only summarize the story comapring to when you're in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages.

Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. For example if students don't have a high GPA, the most common thing that would happen would be that they will be rejected by a lot of collages. Having a high GPA can help you get into good collages without having to pay and you can also earn money while you're attending collage. students will be able to graduate early from collage and with a really high degree that could benefit them by finding job where they start at the top like others professionals people.

Students will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. For example nova is an academic instutude collage that has a lot of benifits for students such as saving money for collage. Have apportunities of going to others university or instutudes where you can work as an asisting and get well paid. Nova can be very helpful institutude that students can attened to because they only attened to nova for two years. At nova they prepare students to when they are ready to move on to a four year collage but you need to have a good GPA and have all the requirements that nova asks for.

However not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home. For example if students don't attened to school they won't be able to understand anything which it will cause them to stress out and make them give up on there dreams. students won't adchieve if we let them attend classes from home. Students also don't agree about having good grades and a good GPA. For example students think that they can still go to the collages they want to attened without matter of there grades and GPA that all they had to do is pay. but the question is ""do you have the money to pay collage?"". ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
73CDE1582FCB,"Public schools are not always the best to attend. Thats why some schools have other options for kids/ parents that dont want to attend them or dont want there children attending them. There usually a lot of bad situations that happen in public schools. There a lot of disrespect that come from the students that dont care about school. Students skip classes to fight or be disruptive.

This is why i think Homeschooling or home bound is a wonderful thing to have. Some kids never wanna get up and come to school so they end up skipping school. So having this ""Distance Learning"" stuff is a wonderful thing to have. Even when kids dont wanna come to school they can still learn and get there education from the comfort of there own home.

When doing home bound, you get assigned to a teacher and they pick up your work for you and come to your home or where ever else yall wanna meet and do the work together in case the student has any questions. The students and teacher would meet at least twice a week so the teacher can teach the student a new lesson on what they are teaching in school. The one bad thing about home bound is that you cant work while on home bound. Although not being able to work isnt that much of a problem for students on home bound.

Students that get home schooled by there parents or another adult have a little bit more freedom then kids on home bound because they have teachers that check on them and make sure they are doing there work and turning it in on time.

I believe home schooling and or home bound is a wonderful thing to have for kids. I feel that we learn better when were alone and get to study a subject or unit as long as we need so we know it. In school units get taught so fast that students that learn slower than others dont really have a chance to get to know it. In conclusion i love the fact that we have al these different opertunitys for everyone.                 ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
00203C45FC55,"It is every student's dream to be able to lounge around at home, and complete school from the comforts of their own beds. Though, for some students, this long desired fantasy is becoming a reality. With the introduction of new and innovative technologies into the classroom, distance learning is now a common practice, whether it be online or through video conferencing. However, to pretend that this is a solution to the ever-growing problems within the education system, is willfully ignorant. Distance education is actually detrimental to the students who choose to take these courses, due to the lack of typical classroom structure.

Everybody knows somebody like this in their lives; a homebody, someone who prefers staying home over going out, maybe doesn't have too many friends or has trouble forging bonds and building relationships. You may also call these people recluses, or shut-ins, but either way, you've stumbled across someone who fits this mold. Favorite characters even, like Oscar the Grouch or Angela from The Office, can be used as lovable examples. However, these traits are not always so endearing in a young child. Kids who display anti-social tendencies or simply wish to stay home and away from the hustle-and-bustle of the outside world would prefer distance learning undoubtedly. But, they would then forfeit the opportunity to build relationships with other kids of their own age. Especially with younger kids and kids who like to stay at home or be alone, learning and building social skills starts at school. If these children have the option to conduct their learning from home, they will miss out on important interactions with classmates, and also fall behind from a social development standpoint. And not knowing or understanding social cues or the proper way to communicate with someone, will prove a major hindrance to these kids in later years.

Another negative aspect of distance learning is the lack of discipline. Having a friend who is online-schooled, who admits frequently that he has ample free time, which he wastes on playing video games and watching TV, while at the same time, students in the classroom are made to do tedious book-work, is very eye-opening to a pressing issue. Students who take classes online have more time to slack off and goof around, and for the less-disciplined child, this will reflect negatively in their grades. However, some people will raise the point that there are distractions within in the classroom and students will slack off anyway, if they so desire. This is a valid observation. But without the constant droning of a teacher to be on task, kids who are distantly educated are more likely to become distracted and it's displayed in their meager and unsatisfactory work. Distractions don't cease to exist in a classroom setting, but they are heavily reduced compared to when a student is at home.

It's easily understandable that for some students, distance learning is simply the only viable option. Whether they physically cannot make it to the school building, or because their school merely doesn't offer the classes they wish to take, sometimes students are more or less forced to take online classes. And this is completely acceptable and understandable, and no one should fault these students for desiring an education and seeking out alternative options. However, these circumstances aren't always applicable to the students who choose distance learning. And those students, who have no other reason other than they ""just want to stay home"" or ""don't feel like it"", should have to sit in a classroom with the rest of their peers, and learn like in the same setting and environment that everyone else does. For lazy students, distance education is not a valuable resource, and abused in order to waste time.

Distance education will most likely always be a hotly debated topic, in which both sides of the argument will raise many deeply introspective and thought-provoking questions and points. In some cases, distance education is necessary and important. However, it cannot be ignored that distance learning is not conducive or beneficial to most students. The lack of a normal classroom set-up, with teachers and classmates replaced for a laptop and a of couple blankets, fails to help students develop vital social and communication skills, while simultaneously aiding in the slacking off and wasting time of many students. All in all, distance learning and education isn't an appropriate replacement for a normal education that is received in a classroom, at a desk. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
8C003FEE68D7,"By the age of 3, parents send their tots to pre-school, a place for kids to experience and learn outside of their homes. These small children learn to listen, behave, and, most importantly, socialize with other kids their age. With these social abilities, the kids are sent to kindergarden, a slightly bigger classroom in order for greater socialization and assimilation. What follows is middle school, then the largest, high school. However, with the rise of technology, an increase in a game-changing kind of education has been popularized: Online schooling. At an alarming rate, students have turned to this alternative in order to remain in the comfort of their own home. This comfort only goes so far; at what point does comfort turn into isolation? Through a screen, kids cannot nearly reach the needed amount of socialization and experience that regular, out-of-the-house schooling provides. Students would not benefit from the ability to take classes online as it hinders not only their social abilities, but also future job performance.

Students who attend school on a daily basis learn the basic social skills necessary for a job. Whether it's relationships with co-wrokers or bosses, these types of social skills help one keep up their career, something in which their livlihood depends on. Schooling provides knowledge on how to treat a boss. For example, in the memoir

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou, Angelou claims that she skipped school in order to provide labor to her family business. When she got her first job as a housemaid at the age of 14, she had never experienced the discipline of a real teacher, a problem that also comes with online schooling. A few days into the job, Angelou broke numerous plates in spite of her ""unfair"" boss, but failed to realize the repercussions that would follow. If Angelou had attended real schooling, it's evident that she would be familiar with punishments that come with misbehaving, and likey would not have been fired. For online school, without a true disciplinary figure, kids could become just as naive as Angelou in the workplace. Outside-of-the-house school also teaches young adults about the social importance of punctuality. For example, for three years I've been the pianist for the school jazz band. Arriving to school at 7:30am every Wednesday is draining, however I've learned that if I'm late, I will get in trouble by not only my band director, but I will have also have let down all my band-mates. This has taught me to always be punctual to my hostessing job at a local resteraunt, knowing that if I fail to show up, I will have let down my co-workers. Such activites, that require punctuality, are not a factor of online schooling. Since punctuality is a necessary aspect of a job, students need to learn the trials and tribulations of punctuality in order to refrain from minimizing their good relations with co-workers and bosses in order to keep their jobs.

Online school will not provide students with proper skills in forming regular friendships. Healthy marriage, family, and peer relationships all are the product of how we learned to get along with others in the schooling days of our adolesance. For example, in the novel

Into the Wild by John Krakauer, outdoorsman Chris McCandless, from Annadale, VA, attended public school all the way until high school. Throughout his jounrney into the midwest, he credits all his friendships made along to journey to the ones that he made in Annadale. Always a social man, unlike other outdoorsman, McCandless learned to form bonds, for example the lifelong bond with elderly man Franz, in which they remained friends throughout the his journey. At resturaunts and bars across the west coast, workers claimed that McCandless had outstanding charisma compared to other wanderers. Other outdoorsmen who travel the west typically don't have the same social skills as they've been isolated from the world their whole lives. To compare it to online schooling, kids most likely will not gain the skills to form lifelong friendships if they are in isolation from the outside world, just like a typical outdoorsman. Also, with online schooling, students may have a harder time with future girlfriend/boyfriend relationships later in life as they've been isolated from their own age group for the majority of adolesance. My grandmother, being an only child and homeschooled living in the rural part of Louisiana, told me about the trials and tribulations of her finding my grandfather. Because she was so isolated from her own age group, she wasn't sure of how to properly act around men her age. Fifteen years of being an adult landed her next to my grandfather, but it was only after a long, hard single life that she was able to keep down the right one. Online school would have kids delaying their relationships due to lack of social interaction around peers their age, making it difficlult to find a solid relationship.

Others may disagree and claim that the online schooling resources, such as skype, will provide students with the social interaction they need outside of their own families. While skyping does provide some interaction, learning through a screen will never provide students with the same student-teacher bond that is necessary for building mentor-type relationships in the future. More importantly, with only a teacher, where is the peer interaction? Kids learn content most efficiently when interacting with other peers on a daiy basis. For instance, in AP chemistry, notably one of the hardest classes my school has to offer, the teacher assigns group work every day after learning a new subject. When I work on the content with my peers, they provide me with easier shortcuts and alternatives than what my teacher taught. With Skype, no peers are present to help a student with a touchy subject. There is just the teacher, and only what's in that teacher's brain can be offered to the student.            ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
32E980DFCD96,"Many students in the U.S. are being advised to stay home due to the Coronavirus spreading and now becoming known as a worldwide pandemic. These students are now staying home and continuing their classes online. Many college students are offered the chance to take online or virtual courses. Some courses may require an online or virtual class depending on what you are trying to achieve. Unfortunately, not all schools agree with distant learning and do not offer the option. Although some may disagree, many students would benefit from having the opinion to attend classes online or by video conferencing because it gives them more opportunities.

With the current virus going around, it is best for students to stay home and take online classes to watch their health and avoid catching anything. Online classes can provide better safety from viruses or diseases. During the winter is when many people fall ill due to colds, or maybe even the flu. During the spring and summer is when flowers are in bloom, it is raining more, but they are also the allergy seasons. If students stay inside, crowded by others like they are in classrooms, then there is a better chance for any contagious sicknesses to be spread. With the Coronavirus being announced as a national pandemic and spreading like wildfire, it is the perfect time to stay home.

Online classes could help many students financially and physically. With online classes, parents can save their money by not having to pay for school supplies, fees, exam fees, or other things like field trips. Online classes can help save money because all you need is a computer or an electronic device, a good internet connection, and the directions for your work. Moreover, you could even go to the library or a cafe to use public internet and save your electricity bill from going up at home. In addition, online classes can give students the opportunity to get more rest. A lot of students do not get the rest they need due to having so much work and having to wake up so early for school. However, they would not be able to sleep as late as they probably would want to, online classes allow them to get a bit more rest than they would if they had to leave for school.

Although some may disagree, many students would benefit from having the opinion to attend classes online or by video conferencing because it gives them more opportunities. Online classes could be difficult for taking tests and could be prone for cheating. Online classes are beneficial for students because it can help them to stay healthy, to save money, and to get the rest students need. In conclusion, online classes are something that would be beneficial to all students if they are available, and if they are not available then the school should make it available for the students and in case of any sudden closings. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
3F1E511E2E1E,"Schools that provides distance learning as an option to attend classes from home online, or video conferencing are few of all the country. It is a good idea for all students that wants to graduate, even if they don't have time to go to school every day.

Students some times don't have time to go to school every day, some of them works in a part time jobs; That's difficult to them because, they need to wake up earlier to go to school and do homework in the afternoon.

Some students decided not go to school any more because, they need to work to pay bills, and help their families in home. Also, with this option students can be relaxing in their homes and studying at the same time. Another example why this is a good option for students is because some of them need classes to graduate, and they can not get that classes done by the school year, but if they have the possibility to take classes online they can finish during the year.

However, this beneficial option is good for those students that are not eligible anymore to attend school because of their ages. There is a final age that students can be accepted by the school, and if they had more than the age the school said, they can not attend to school anymore, even if they want to continue going to school and graduate. That's why online classes from home is great idea for those students who wants the diplomat.

In conclusion this option is beneficial for all students that want to study and do other jobs in the same time. Those who work and wants to finish school, are benefit with this amazing idea that some schools provide. The're just few schools that students can assist for those who want to get their diplomas done with facility way to study.

3C04A5B6C8F8,"Online schooling has become very popular over the last couple of years. There has been an ongoing debate over should students attend class by online or video conference. Those who disagree state, students will not be able to have peer to peer interactions, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, I believe students should be able to attend classes online.

Students being able to attend online school can benefit in a variety of ways. Online school can help students feel more comfortable about attending class. Many students may be afraid of new places or even new people; however, online school can decrease the amount of stress in students than a traditional classroom setting. From the comfort of their own home, students can feel at ease and less stressed about the work given. This type of schooling is also a cheaper option. The use of transportation to school and from school are no longer needed. The late buses and absent car rides can not prevent students from learning while doing online schooling. The need for any on campus or school purchases will not be needed. On campus necessities like room and board, dining and parking fees will not be needed through online learning. Moreover, that money could be used in a more progressive way. A huge plus about online school is that it can work around any busy schedule. Online school is easier to access all day, so anyone can access it anywhere, anytime. Students who take vacations or travel a lot benefit because of how easy the access is to assignments.

There are further reasons why students should attend online classes. Online schools offer a more personal learning experience. Video conferencing or chatting with a teacher allows a student's undivided attention on the subject matter. This causes students to respect teachers and have a good rapport. Personalized learning is used more during online school because of the availability of each student is different. These virtual classrooms can also be less of a disturbance. There would not be a loud classroom distracting the teacher or student from doing their job. Student will not be dependent on other classmates for answers or conversations during lectures. Students at home have an advantage to complete at home responsibilities. For example, chores can be finished sooner because of the time spent at home rather than in a traditional school setting. Family situations can also be dealt with because of the at home availability by online classrooms.

Although some may disagree, I believe students should be able to attend classes online. This is the case due to being a cheaper option, less disturbances, and helps students feel more comfortable. Those who oppose state students will not have peer to peer interactions and not everyone has access to a computer, but this is not true. Many Americans have different values; however, every American deserves to get an education no matter the circumstance. Online schooling can introduce new ways of learning and benefit our modern society. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
84705C9E9180,"To begin with, I personally think students wouldn't benefit taking school online and these are my reasons why.

I think that some students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home, Just because they wouldn't understand what they are learning and It would be harder for them to actually understand the concept and do the work.

The students wouldn't have help from a teacher when they don't understand something or when they need help. some students would'nt be able to concentrate on doing the work because they may be distracted by something going on around the house. May have things to do around the house and wouldn't be able to do his work and turn in work on time. The student would find a way to get the answers rather then learning the concept.

The students won't learn a lot about things that some classes teach you such as, learning how to manage money and in school they can teach you those things step by step. They wouldn't be use to waking up every morning and if they have a job they would wake up or be late because they weren't use to waking up early every day just like the students that go to school. ",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2
21C75B3F290A,"For the past few hundred years, school systems have consisted of one specific format, where students go to a place of learning and are taught by teachers. But now, with easier access to better technology, this school system is changing. Some schools are offering distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This new system has gained both positive and negative attention. Although many say that distance learning encourages laziness and creates a communication barrier between students and others, distance learning is in fact beneficial to the student, for learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process.

However, many argue that the student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, for distance learning would encourage laziness and create a communication barrier between students and others. Understandably, these points are legitimate, for the student could easily choose not to join the online conference to their class, for no teacher could force them to go to their next class. But this is just the same concept as skipping class. A student has their own free will, and may choose whether they go to their class or not, or whether they attend their video conference to their class as well. Laziness is not encouraged by distance learning, but instead students have the choice to either attend their video conference or not, just as they have the choice to attend their class at a normal school as well: there is no major difference between these methods of skipping class. Many also point to a communication barrier between the students and their peers and teacher. However, the technology today of online and video conferences, such as Skype, can offer both auditory and visual interaction between the student and others. It's exactly like a classroom setting, with the only difference being that the student isn't physically there. In the future, with even more and more technological advances, these virtual interactions will become even more effective. Distance learning would also help to block out the other distractions that come with school.

Distance learning would help get rid of the other distractions that come with going to school, such as a student's social life. The main purpose of school has always been one goal: to educate the student and teach them how to learn. But inside schools many distractions are present. The social life of a student, whether that be talking to another student during class, or interactions in the hallway, has become a huge distraction to learning. However, with distance learning, these distractions would be eliminated. Of course, at-home learning will open up the possibility of home distractions, but the number of distractions will certainly be less than the number of distractions at school. With this removal of distractions, a new focus on learning is produced, one that is much more stress-free.

A more stress-free learning experience, due to the removal of school-related distractions, would make the process of learning much more effective for the student, fulfilling the main goal of schools: to educate the student and teach them how to learn. Stress due to school has become a major problem in our school systems. Students staying up until the early hours of the morning to do homework is an example. However, what students don't know, is that if the distractions of school are eliminated, by learning at home through online or video conference, they would be much more focused and would feel comparably less stressed as they go about their schoolwork. Being less stressed would make learning a more enjoyable, fulfilling experience, and would be much more effective for the student.

Learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process. With the process of learning becoming more effective, students would be able to learn at unprecedented rates and would be ready to tackle the problems of our world. Because isn't that the whole point of education, and more specifically school? To educate the student and teach them how to learn, so that one day, when the students are making decisions that will not only impact themselves but the whole world, they will be ready and willing to take on these challenges.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

Think about students take their classes from their home, and schools disappears. technology change things and now the schools are online. What is the advantages of students. Some say online schools should be good because they don't have to worry about be on time to get the bus. Although, some people say online schools should not be good because they don't going to know how world works, and they can just play games or distract their self with other things on the computer.

it will be good have a school in my house, may be i don't have to wake up early. I don't have to wake up my parents to tell them if they can droop me at school. It will be happier for may students. study in their house with computers, and also they don't have to eat the food of the school. At this day technology is a important tool that we can use for many things, and also adults who don't finish high school can use online school to graduate.

If you think careful online school will have a disadvantages, and students can mess up everything. Some of then will go to study do their home works, but what about others the lazy students. They just going to play games or easily don't enter to the online class.

They will not have some that can push them up. Parents are working, and there is not teacher they going to say ""i don't gonna do anything"" another fact the online schools is not is they don't practice the responsibility. if they are always in home they will not know how this country (USA) work.

Other people think all schools should have the distance learning to take classes at home. People continue discussion about the issue. Some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school because some students do not have transport to go to school, students can decide the time they want to take the classes, and students do not need to go out of their homes in winter time.

One major reason about some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school is that some students do not have transport to go to school. Many people has that problem because they do not know how to drive. Other students do not drive because they do not have legal documents. Some students do not have money to buy their own car. Some students are too young and do not have license to drive. Some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school and students can decide to take the classes at home.

Another major reason about some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school is that students can decide the time they want to take the classes. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students have a job. Students can help their mom with their little sibblings to take care of them. Students can also help their mom in housekeeping. Some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school and students can decide the time they want to take the classes.

The last major major reason about some schools offer distance learning for students who live far away from school is that students do not need to out of their homes in winter.

Well, I am going to be explaining why students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students nowadays get distracted by school drama like issues with teachers and problems with friends . Also, if students attend classes online or by video conferencing; I feel like students will be able to focus more and cancel out all the major distractions in their life. My position is that students would benefit from attending classes at home because less conflicts and drama appear to happen. Also, students will be able to focus better if they are at home learning rather than going to public area with plenty of people in one setting .

There are a lot of benefits from online schooling because you get to isolate yourself from toxic situations that happen in school. In my opinion, I think drama and distractions in school tremendously can effect a students grades. A student attending classes from home can help resolve conflicts and drama that could be happening to the student in school. Another reason why online schools would be beneficial to students is because students tend to follow the wrong crowd and associate with the wrong people in school; However, attending school from home would stop that because the student would be able to focus more on their school work then the drama and distraction that occur at school. Also, students tend to have conflicts with teachers which can effect a student understanding the concept of a subject. With online classes, issues with teachers can be resolved because it's all on you to do the work and there is no else to blame but yourself.

Students would be able to focus more at home rather than at school. Because, at school the classroom setting is big and there are a lot of students in just one room. But, attending school at home is most likely a small space where a student can focus better and get their mind clear so they can succeed in that particular class. In my experience at school when I'm with a lot of students in a classroom I tend to get distracted easily because of the high capacity of people in the room. Students who are with a lot of people in a classroom will get distracted easily and most likely when you are distracted it sets you back from getting the grades you are capable of getting. Focusing is a major asset of getting good grades and succeeding. From what I've seen people who focus more on school and less on the distractions around them end up passing the classes instead of failing. Testing situations with homeschooling can be beneficiary as well because, in school it's a hectic environment to take a test. But, if you are attending classes at home the environment is less hectic and you can have more time to take the test.

Although, I agree with homeschooling; Some, could say homeschooling is not beneficial. Homeschooling can cause mental health problems like social anxiety and depression. The reason why, is because students who are attending classes at home will not have time to interact with their peers who are most likely around their age group. Associating with your peers especially as a teenager is extremely important. Because, developing social skills with people is a reliable asset in the real world typically if you are trying to get a job of some sort. However, it would be more beneficial if students take classes from home than go to school because there are more pros than cons in this situation.

In conclusion, people are so caught up on the formal rituals in society today but never think outside the box. Going to a public school or private school is not for everyone; Sometimes, students need to take a different route to succeed. Thats why attending school at home is the right way to go because the benefits are something you can't ignore. For example, imagine having a quiet space to yourself focusing just on school work and nothing else. That would dramatically improve students test scores and help students understand what their learning more effectively.

Lets take a step back, all the distraction and conflicts in public or private schools are terrible. Is it really worth it if homeschooling can basically resolve those major issues that occur nowadays in school.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
980F069B1644,"Some schools offer programs that allow students to learn through an online class or video conferencing. These programs can help students complete high school early and overall help them get a head start on their adult life. Many students like to work at their own pace and depending on how they gather new information, online schooling is a much more comfortable way of education. Although many people believe that learning through online school can't help students as well as traditional schooling where students go to a campus, many others believe that online education is a progressive way of learning that will allow students to work at a pace that is comfortable for them.

For starters, waking up at six in the morning is a struggle for many people, whether it's people going to work or students going to school. Students today value freedom and comfort, which is why if students were to use this new way of education and not take it for granted, online schooling could make a huge impact on future generations that want to learn using this form of education. Many older generations disagree with online education, they believe that if a student has too much freedom, they will soon become rebellious and not work on their schoolwork. Although this is a possibility, the thought that all students will take advantage of this program and slack off is toxic for the students. Many students today know the importance of a quality education which is why older people should trust that students will be responsible enough to make choices that will help them prepare for their future.

Based on my research, students don't necessarily dislike school, their main struggle is to wake up early in the morning to go to school for eight hours. Learning with a teacher is probably the most effective and easy way to obtain new information, which is why video conferencing will still help students learn because they are being taught by an instructor.

The Narrative of Frederick Douglas,

Frederick was a slave with no real education, but, one day his new mistress taught him how to spell a few short words. After that, some kids in his neighborhood taught him the alphabet, then he taught himself how to read and write. He believed that education was the most important hing anyone can have. Frederick Douglas is a perfect example on why learning independently is so beneficial. After reading his narrative, I understand why education is such a privilege, whether its online or not.

On the other hand, studies show that school plays a huge factor on students mental health. The intense tests and quizzes, the continuous deadlines, and most importantly, conforming to social expectations by fellow classmates. All of these examples bring a downfall on students mental health, which can lead to depression, stress, and anxiety. These are key factors on why learning online or learning in school should be decided and accessible by the students. When students have the freedom to learn the way they want, at a pace that feels comfortable to them, their mental heath can improve dramatically. Students will benefit from this method of schooling mentally and academically.

In conclusion, online schooling may not be the best form of education, but there is no doubt that students benefit from it. In my English class, we learned about why self reliance is important, it is where we can rely on ourselves and trust that we make the right decisions. Statistics shows students are more independent and self-reliant when it comes to learning by themselves. Online schooling is an overall independent way of learning which will help students mature and grow as people.  ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
1AA55FB101FD,"Although some schools offer says that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because some students prefer take classes online and for this classes you have to pay, actually If you go to the school you'll have the capacity of learn more faster.

Although some schools offer says that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because there are 50% of students that prefer take classes online and they don't come to the school. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because if they stay at home, they will have more time to spend with their family or make things that they would like to do. And students who stay at home they will have more time to studied another signature like math or they can learn another language. They can practice a sport or they can do whatever they want. If you take a video conferencing this will help you to understand your teacher because a video conferencing explain you what you need to do. And also you will see what is your teacher teaching you.

Reason 1, why students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because if they take classes online they will finish school more early. for example some classes online are more shorter than a school year. School year require have 315 days of classes and you have to be in the school for about 6 to 8 hours per day. And also they need to complete some credits to graduated. If you want to finish school you have to complete this credits. To have complete this credits you have to take some classes that are require to complete those credits.

Reason 2, why students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because if they studied at home they can go to doctor's appointment. There are 70% of students that doesn't come to the school because they have doctor appointment and they mostly are absent. Attendants is very important in the school because if you want to have good greats you have to come every day. If you take classes online you will have the capacity of learn more faster and whatever test that they give you online you'll available to past them.

Although some schools offer think that distance of learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would benefit at some students that choose studied online or by a video conferencing. There are a good reasons why students prefer to studied online. That's the majority of students prefer stay at home and take classes online.            ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
13CFDB110C7C,"Although some people may find learning online as a bad thing because it is not as effective as being in school. It actually can be really beneficial to the students, for example: kids who prefer one on one with the teacher, kids can focus better without having too many distractions, and students can go at their own pace when learning the material. In this paper, we will be discussing how offering the chance to learn at home can be good for the students.

One reason why kids would benefit from learning at home is they will be able to focus more. Lots of kids in school seem to get easily distracted by friends, their phone, and by their surroundings in school whether it be inside or outside. But, with learning online you can be in the comfort of your own home with as little distractions as possible. When you attend your class at home you'll be more focused and get more work done. Which will only help you more in the end. When it comes to being in school, the students tend to get easily distracted than they normally would be at home. Students getting the chance to do work at home will only benefit them more for the future. If they're able to focus more now at home doing work, that amount of focus will stick with them especially when they have a job or when they're off to college.

The second reason onto why learning online is good is you'll be able to go at your own pace. In school, sometimes teachers can go really fast and you won't understand a single thing about the material. Even when telling a teacher to slow down, it doesn't always help. They might speed right back up. But when it comes to learning at home, you're able to go as slow as you want or as fast as you want. When you learn at your own pace, it can help you understand your material more in depth than you normally would in school. Going at your own pace can make things seem easier to learn or do. It also puts less pressure on you trying to learn the material on the spot at that given moment. Learning how to work at your own pace is good because it'll show you not to rush your work and to take time with doing it.

Some people might have a different opinion when it comes to online learning. Some may say kids will take advantage of this opportunity and not do anything or they will say it's just not as effective as physically being in school with others. Online learning may not work for everybody though. Like, some kids need a teacher to be there when they have questions because it's easier for them to have someone there at all times and not just through a screen. With the kids who need teachers to be there for them, it might be hard to adjust to these new accommodations. While other students may not always have access to the internet or power. Which would mean said student would not be able to attend their online classes and get any work done.

In conclusion, online learning can be a lot more beneficial than people anticipated. It can be a more effective tool for kids to learn where they are most comfy without all the distractions around them. Although, certain aspects to learning online can be fixed, it has deemed itself quite beneficial. So, if kids were given this opportunity to learn from home, it would only benefit students greatly by being easy to learn one on one with a teacher, being able to focus more at home with no distractions, and being able to learn and work at your own pace without feeling rushed. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
D9B9F1212FB0,"The majority of students either live in a dorm or have access to transportation, but how will the minority get to class? Some might say online classes are meant for lazy students, but they would be wrong. Online classes, like any other class, still require skill and dedication. Online classes would benefit students through learning in a more comfortable environment and at a pace preferred or required.

Online classes would benefit students through making the learning environment more comfortable. Like any class attendance is key, even if you are having a bad day. while students who take online classes also have bad days, they do not need to worry about going to class. Online students can learn in any clothes, eat, and take breaks at any time they want.

Online classes would also benefit students through learning at a preferred or required pace. While most teachers would love to help every confused student, there just is not enough time in any normal class. Students may also be too embarrassed to ask a question out loud. Online classes would give students the power to pause or review any part of a class.

In conclusion, online classes are a very useful tool that should be taken advantage of if needed. Students would benefit through online classes by being able to learn in a more comfortable environment and at any preferred or required pace. Students could review any class at any time, and wear any clothes, eat, or take a break at any time and still learn something new!",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
0A082DA0A890,"I agree with student taking online classes. Because some student might be to old for then to attend school or do a fulltime school program. By doing online classes. Student will be not worring about attend school on time, if they get sick or have to travel for a emergency happen. They would have the chance of talking with their counselor and talk about sign up for online school. If the teacher give them homework they would have the chance of sending by email.

In other way been able to take classes online, give the student a chance of choosing their own schedule for example, some student might to take classes in the moprning, some student might want to take classes afternoon or at night time. Taking classes online give the student a chance of doing classes in the other side of the country or anywhere. Many student are not able to attend school.

Attending online school give the student the advantage of working or doing their own projects at home for example student won't relay on school supplies. Students by taking classes online benefits then, because some student have two jobsor lives to far, and they are to old for attending school.

For the students that have two jobs. They get the chance to use there work break to take some classes, test, or even quizzes. For example in my side of the story if my school would give online i would be able to have to jobs and support my family paying some bills. For other student have the same problem.

In my conclusion taking classes online benefits the student in many different ways. for example by choosing their opwn schedule, by given then the opportunity of doing their own things, by giving then a aesier way to learn, by showing then that they are adults now and demostrating and teaching to do take the right choose.     ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
24A44D78C494,"The purpose of going to school is that students are on a mission to succeed. Students getting up early in the morning and going to school to get the education they need is admirable. The students' passion for education would not benefit if they took classes from home because there would be more distractions, minimal diversity, and lack of efficiency.

Firstly, the amount of distractions in students' homes would be catastrophic in obtaining the right education. For example, say a student has a job, the student has to work at least 3-4 hours a day, that same student also has to finish an assignment for his/her online class. The student gets home, exhausted, not willing to do the assignment that is imperative to the student's grade point average. This then becomes a natural tendency for the student which is a huge problem in taking classes online because the student is not able to focus on what is important for his/her education. There are other distractions if a student were to take an online class from home, including video games and TV. These distractions would cause students to develop the ability to not prioritize their education and focus on other things around them.

Secondly, if a student were to take an online class from home there would be minimal diversity. For students to succeed in life they must surround themselves with good relations with others in public. Students cannot succeed if they are at home, taking an online class. In addition, taking online classes from home would affect students negatively because the students would not develop any social skills, especially communication. Communication is key to having a good relation with others, for students would add to their collection of skills in the real world. Those, are the reasons why students who take an online class from home would be not helpful.

Thirdly, the lack of efficiency in students taking online classes from home would not be beneficial towards their education. In an online class from home, students could wake up at any time and decide when to start the class, and that would result in laziness. Whereas class at school, students went to class on a daily basis which resulted in accomplishing school work at the appropriate time. Another example, when a student needs to complete a project, the student at school would focus on that project and get it done, but from home the student would most likely put it aside and complete at a later time. Hence, the effect of students taking online classes from home is lack of efficiency.

Overall, online classes from home would not assist the students in their desire for education because of multiple distractions, the decrease in diversity, and the inability to complete a task on time. The distractions would cause the students to not focus on their priorities, such as completing a certain task. The decrease in diversity would cause social awkwardness in students. Lastly, the lack of efficiency would effect the student to become lazy. However, students that take online classes would be able to learn as they receive direct feedback from the instructor by video chatting or sending messages in regards to a certain assignment the student was confused about. In the end, taking online classes from home would not benefit students' passion for education.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
55F9635ECFD7,"""Glad I can cheat on this test."" Many would have this same thought if given the opportunity to take classes from home. Moreover, cheating would not be the only the negative outcome from taking classes at home. Classes at home have no real advantage over classes at school. The idea that students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home is invalid; furthermore, students would only receive negative effects from classes at home such as social anxiety and lack of concentration.

First and foremost, classes at school offer a better learning experience overall. A school building is a physical location that students go to specifically for learning. Therefore, students associate entering school as entering a place where concentration is needed to learn. In contrast, staying at home to take classes does not trigger the concentration switch in most students. Staying at home means students are remaining in the same place they eat, sleep, and enjoy free time. This means students feel less of a need to concentrate and try their hardest since they are casually sitting at home.

Secondly, classes at school lead to better social skills. When students go to school they interact and socialize with other students. This interaction helps build their social skills that they will need when they go out into the real world. If students were to stay home they would not receive much social interaction. This lack of interaction will make them uneasy when they are forced to socialize. In fact, they are more likely to try and avoid social interaction all together since they are not very accustomed to it.

Although many may argue that classes from home are in fact beneficial as they lead to lack of social anxiety. This is actually incorrect as classes from home do the exact opposite in the grand scheme of life. Staying at home offers temporary satisfaction to those who do not like social interaction. But, in the long run those students are only hurting themselves as they are slowly being less acclimated to social interaction. The more exposure a student gets to socialization the more they build on those already existing social skills. Classes from home would only mess with those social skills.

Overall, classes from home have no real benefit to students. Students that go to school are the ones that receive the actual benefit. Plus, going to school is an activity that has always happened and it works. So why fix something that is not broken? Therefore, students have nothing to lose by going to school, but a lot to lose by staying home. Classes from home do not benefit students at all.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
B29CFA250576,"Ancient civilizations like Rome, Egypt, and Greece have all had something in common that allowed them to survive through the ages and leave their imprint in history. Education and learning has been at the base of every society as it's important to always be progressing; even education itself has progressed through out time. Great thinkers like Plato and Arestotle influenced the discussions of many and continue to do so; however, knowledge is more accesible now and is regarded as a necessity for the masses in most countries. A way that schools are reaching more students is by taking advantage of technology. Online classes and video conferenicng has become increasingly popular. Although it's dangerous to rely so heavily on technology, online school and video conferenicng is a positive thing as many adults who wish to seek higher education ,but are too busy, use this method, people with anxiety issues can learn from the safety of their homes, and it can even be used as a backup plan for when there is a hinderance in the physical school.

Most people are engulfed by their day to day life and responsibilties like their jobs and families. By taking advanatge of online courses and video conferencing, these adults are able to fufill their duties as well as work torwards their goals! A common demographic that uses this method is teachers! While most attend college for four years and get certified in order to enter the work force faster, some decide to persue a higher degree such as a masters or even a Phd. However, not everyone has that luxury. A higher degree typically means higher pay, which incentivizes these proffesionals to enroll in classes. Even more important are classes that work around their schedule. All while working for a better future such as the Physics, AP US history, and other teachers here at Generic_School.

While conserving time and energy is important, conserving mental health is just as critical. There is a high statistic of students that suffer from anxiety, depression, and bullying. These conditions can put a damper on grades and social life, not to mention self esteem. These issues are not new, except now students have an alternative. Mental health has been increasinly gaining traction in schools as they try to make the students feel safer, although it's not always effective. A well known youtuber named Antonio Garza has talked about her struggles in high school, such as a lack of motivation to do anything, usually asscociated with depression, and the anxiety of being in a room where they are being judged. By choosing to leave daily public high school in favor of online courses, she has been able to feel more liberated and reduced their anxiety that comes as a result of large groups. Many teenagers and adults alike can relate to these problems personally.

Traditional school that takes place is a physical building is preferred by many, but what happens when the physical building is not available or being avoided? Covid-19, better known as the Corona Virus, has paralyzed the world, specially east asian countries. School children are being told not to come to school for their own safety. The World Health organization cannot be sure of when this ordeal will be over; thus, immobilizing the education system for an unknown period of time. Thankfully, there are many apps and programs that schools have been using to keep the lessons afloat. Video conferencing and virtual worksheets have made this time of distress feel relatively normal to school children all throughout the affected regions, until it can actually go back to normal.

From the distant times of Plato and Arestotle to the common era, learning has always been placed on a pedestal. New forms and methods of education are always being born. A popular option being online classes and conferencing which have already made a difference for adults and teenagers alike in time management, accomodation for mental health, as well as a rampant illness right now. While technology is a good thing, it's important to acknowledge too much of anything can be intoxicating. Overall, school systems and people everywhere can benefit from these ingenious programs! ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
669954011A4C,"Do you think attending class online from home will benefit you and your studies? My sister took a class online that was required for her to graduate. She rushed through it and it was a huge waste of time. Therefore she didn't gain any knowledge. It would've been more beneficial if she took the class in school with a teacher in the same room as her with more instruction. Attending a class online at home can prevent you from: learning your social skills, participating with hands on work, learning time management skills.

School is a very important part to peoples life. Not only the learning aspect is important, but also the social aspect. You meet new people,not only in the beginning but also at the very end. You form relationships with others and get to make so many memories. I met my best friend in first grade and she is still my best friend. Her name is Generic_Name. She has introduced me to so many other people and has got me out of my comfort zone. My favorite part about the friendship is the memories we have made, the trust we gained, and the respect we have for each other. She has made me a better person and has opened up my eyes to be able to accept others no matter what they look like or how they feel on the inside. Some may argue that you can make a best friend with the people you go to church with, however you don't necessarily get to see them everyday which can lead to not communicating to them and loosing the bond you have with that person. I have made so many other friends through my Abby and we have such a strong bond with all of us its hard to break. I get so exited to wake up early and go to school just see my best friends, which always makes my day better. If I were to attend class online I wouldn't be the person I am today.

Participating with hands on work and instructions by a teacher is important to students learning abilities. Their job as a teacher is to inform you about the information your presented with, and be able explain it to you the best way possible. Therefore, you can retain it and be able to apply it when it comes into play. I was in my 7th grade science class on a Monday. The week before I took a test on the biology of a spider. I didn't learn anything about it because I was sick and wasn't present in the class for the lesson and instruction given by my teacher. I missed a whole week and in the week my teacher gave out ways to help remember the information about the spiders life. I struggled so much on the test and didn't perform well. My teacher gave me the opportunity to retake it. I stayed after school and took notes while she presented me with details and ways to remember the steps of the spiders biology. That night I went home and re wrote my notes out until I can remember all the information she taught me. I took the test. Later, I found out I scored perfect on it. Im a visual learner and have to be present in class to be able to comprehend what I learn. I have to write everything down or drawl it out so my brain will be able to remember the information. If I don't remember the information on a specific test I have coming up, I can go back into my notes I wrote and re-write it out so I see the words again and again which helps my brain remember it better.

Some may argue that, getting instruction by teachers is a waste of time, however it helps students find clarity in the information they are presented with, which they are required to learn and know it. Its harder to learn over a screen and be able to retain the information that is just presented to you without explanation.

Being able to managing your time with school work now is a very important tool you will also need for later in life. Being on top of your school work means being able to complete it and turning it in on time. My friend attended school online from 1st-8th grade. When she got to high school she didn't know how much time she should give her self to get all her work done. She struggled with it and ended up failing all her classes her first 2 years of high school. She was so distracted by other things while she was doing her work, likewise, she never completed the work that she needed to get done and ended up not turning the work in. The summer going into her junior year she was depressed but also was very stressed. She ended up committing suicide and it was very hard for me as well as a lot of people to comprehend. A lot of students have a hard time with this task because you have to plan it out and go step by step through the process, but also giving your self enough extra time just in case you dont get it done within that period of time. Its a hard task to map out due to peoples distractions happening internally or externally in their lives. Some may argue that you would dont need to manage your time because it won't effect your school life, however, managing your time is such a helpful tool that will help you become a successful person not only in your academic life but also your work life when your older. With attending classes online could prevent you from learning how to manage your work and can significantly effect your mental health.

Its important for you to attend class in a school environment for you to get the best education. It can also help set you up to be successful, become the best person you can be, and to learn tools that can help you later in life. In the past, students haven't obtained much information while attending online class and puts them below average. That effects their life in a negative way and adds a lot of stress into their lives. Students could be more involved with work and enjoy school if they attended school on a regular. If we get ride of students attending online classes it will help students become a more out going person, learn the task that will help their life be more successful, and teach them the best way they learn. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
2863DFA5BB0D,"Working from home is something that every person dreams of, they dream of being able to wake up at a reasonable time and not even having to leave the comfort of their own home to do their work. For students, that dream should be a choice for them.

While long distance learning can be damaging to a student's high school career, the benefits from working from home outweigh the consequences. Working from home allows a student to fit their work into their own schedule, students with disabilities are given a comfortable working space, and; ultimately, distance learning could improve mental health among teens.

The teenage years are the most important years of a person's life, it is when their brain is developing the most and when their personality really flourishes. One thing that could be detrimental to a student's development is a lack of sleep. Waking up at dawn every day is mentally and physically challenging for students, many students, like myself, skip breakfast so that they can get a few extra minutes of sleep before they have to haul themselves to school for seven non-stop hours. Working from home allows a student to set their own schedule, and allows a student to get the recommended amount of sleep that a teenager should be getting. Another thing that can interfere with a students schedule are doctors appointments, distance learning gives a student the chance to go to their appointment without having to miss a class and fall behind.

Many students have disabilities, whether it be physical or mental, and while the school system tries their hardest to make them comfortable, sometimes it just is not enough. A student with physical disabilities, for example arthritis or an injury, could have trouble when switching classes or walking up a flight of stairs. Working from home lets them sit at a computer desk and access any class they want without having to move. Many students, even if they themselves do not know it, struggle with a mental illness. Mental illnesses or disabilities make it hard for a student to complete day to day tasks, such as group work or being in a unfamiliar and uncomfortable space. Distance learning gives a student with a mental illness the chance to work at their own pace that is comfortable for them.

Mental health is an big issue for teens in this generation. Some mental health issues can be solved by allowing a teen to work from home. At school, there are many things that can be degrading to a teens mental health, one of the main things that damage someones mental health are their overly critical peers. Almost everyone experiences some kind of bullying in their school career and by allowing a student to work from home, it eliminates a lot of the bullying that they can experience while being in a school. By working from home and behind a screen, students no longer have to worry what they look like or how they dress because their peers can not see them. A student has the chance to develop their own sense of style without the burden of having people judge them for wearing what they want.

There may be some consequences, though, when a student works from home, it can be easy for them to slack off without a teacher to remind them when due-dates are. Students who work at school are constantly reminded that they have to get back to work when they slack off, but when they are at home, there is no teacher there to tell them that they are falling behind. Another problem that could occur is that a student could experience a technical difficulty and end up missing a test or project that was due, which could damage their grade.

In conclusion, Distance learning has many benifits that outnumber the few consequences that a student could have while working from home. A student can fit their work into their schedules without having to worry about doctors appointments, lack of sleep is no longer an issue, students with disabilities are given a chance to have a comfortable working space, and; in the long run, working from home can improve a student's mental health.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
77049F94BE17,"Have you ever thought about how it feels to learn from the luxury of your own home? Online learning is very beneficial, to both the student and instructor. It is safer for both the student and instructor than an actual school environment. Taking classes online could be one of the many cures for most teen's sleep deprivation and insomnia. This would also help with time management, which plays a key roll in the success of a student and teacher.

Learning form home through an online class allows students to feel comfortable while learning and in their environment.

Taking courses online provides safety for students and educators that could not be guaranteed in a school environment. Bullying is a problem that is very hard to get under control. People get bullied nationwide, and their is nothing we can do to end it completely. But if allow students take courses from their homes that could cut down on bullying and the violence that comes with it. Online courses protect a child's mental health, stability and insanity. Some students face the pressure of trying to fit in, which eventually leads to signs of depression. Schoolwork along with higher level classes can cause students to become overwhelmed and have breakdowns. Lately in the United States of America their have been a lot of school shootings. This installs fear in both students and their parents. Parents are scared to send heir children to school, and who blames them. Students go to school afraid that it may be their last day on this earth. School is suppose to be the safest place for parents to send their kids but now you never know what could happen.

Online courses could help cure sleep deprivation among teens. Students stay up ours at a time to work on projects, study for test/quizzes, and do homework. since they are in school for eight hours a day they do not have time to relax and take naps. Also their weekends are fully packed with schoolwork that needs to be done for the following week. they have the tendency to overwork themselves without even knowing it. If students keep going at this rate they would have long term effects in the future, such as insomnia. Having insomnia could hurt them in the long run especially in college. Some students fail to pay attention in class. Their minds are cluttered with the thoughts of other classes. They are so tired that it is very easy for them to lose track of what they are doing or what is happening around them. It's hard to focus when you've been up all night to make sure you have your homework done or you studied enough to pass your test. Online classes will allow teen to get enough sleep and relaxation. The body shuts down fast when it hasn't gotten enough sleep This could cause students to fall asleep in class non stop.

Taking courses online at home allow individuals to build a sense of time management skills. if a student plays sports or does and extracurricular activities, it is hard for them to finish homework when they are tired. They go from spending eight long hours at school to another two-three hours at their activity. Students will not procrastinate if they developed time management skills. this will allow them to juggle classwork and projects, all while they play sports or have a job. They will be able to turn in their work on time and get the grade they deserve. This would eliminate the chance of a student submitting sloppy and rushed work.

However, not all students will benefit from online classes. Students have the tendency to procrastinate and not do their work until the night before it is due. This causes them to fail and become upset when they get a bad grade. They believe that they have all the time in the world to finish their work. Sometimes the fail to sign on to the virtual classroom. They don't do any assignments and most teachers dont take late assignments or they take points off. Most kids will use the internet to cheat. They dont learn anything and when it is time for the finale exam in person they have no idea what they are doing.

Their are many ways students can benefit from online classes. They will be safe, it could cure teen sleep deprivation, and ensure time management skills. Students and educators will be strongly impacted by this. Learning from home through an online class allows students to feel comfortable while learning and in their environment.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

People also have many things to do in the morning, so insted of missing school, people later on can do their school work on their own time. A con of taking online classes at home can be slacking off. Their are many pros for tsking online classes at home.

Everyone needs rest, theres not a single person on this planet that doesn't. So insted of waking up at 7 o'clock in the morning to get ready for school, people can sleep in and get more rest. Good rest can leed to better and more focused students. People will have more energy and will get more work done with the extra sleep. Taking online classes will not force students to wake up super early. They'll have the energy to complet their work and more.

People plan things all the time. A lot of the times, Those plans can intervine with school. If people took online classes, they wouldn't have to worry about missing school. They could do what they have to do, then later on do their schhol work. People can also pause their school work and take a break anytime they need to. Online school is great because people can come back and finish their work at any time of the day. Online school also gives the student more time to do work so people don't have to rush or have a due date to complet their studies.

people slack off all the time. Its not hard for people to get destracted and forget to do their school work. People might make plans that take up their whole day. They can also do something that takes a lot of energy, then be to tired to complet work. People can also forget to do an assignment and not do it at all. There are many reasons why online school could be a bad thing.

In conclustion, Online school is a great choise to make. It gives people more rest so they'll have more energy to start the day with. Its also allows people to work on their studies at their own time so they don't have to rush. It isn't hard to forget to do work at home or get destracted and not finish an assingment though.

E974D272C14E,"Discussion among my classmates and teachers regarding online learning has been circulating throughout my school. Many of my peers and teachers have opposing views on the matter. Some students say that it would be easier, and that it would be amazing if we didn't have to be stuck in a classroom all day and sit through a lecture. While, my teachers state it would be much more challenging to teach the material, and for students to obtain it. I do not think that online learning would be beneficial towards students because it diminishes students' creativity, is not realistic in everyday life, and would be unsuccessful due to teenagers lack of motivation.

Creativity should play a key role in a students growth throughout their education. Without being in the classroom, ways to express one's creativity would be limited. Projects, presentations and intellectual conversations would be removed from the learning realm, and would be replaced with watching videos and staring at a computer all day. Technology has been proven to be unhealthy to adults and especially teenagers. It has rotted our brains, shortened our attention span, and removed our creativity. Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day. If we were to take online classes from home we would be constantly hovered over our computer screens, diminishing our creativity and forgetting what school used to mean.

Online school is not realistic and does not help teenagers prepare for the real world. With online school there would be few, if not any, interaction between peers or with adults. Teenagers today can barley talk to an adult without looking at their feet and avoiding eye-contact, due to the lessening of interaction in the classrooms. Online learning would only increase the problem. Most jobs across the country and throughout the rest of the world all have a form of interaction whether it is presenting a presentation, discussion in meetings, business calls, marketing, and much more. Students would be ill-prepared to step into the real world and be successful in their next step of life. Life is not seen through a computer screen and nor should it ever. While technology can be practical at times, it should not be what students rely on for their education.

Teenagers lack of motivation would lead to the unproductive reality of online school. Most teenagers do not have the discipline, or attention span to take time out of their day, everyday, to sit down at home for hours on end and learn online. Most teenagers need discipline in the classroom. When in school, if students get off track their is a teacher there to help them focus and be productive. When sitting in a desk at school, teenagers are much more productive then if they were to lay in bed at home watching videos. If one were to take online classes at home they would no longer face the discipline teachers show them everyday in school when saying, ""put your phone away!"" or ""stop talking!"" or ""wake up!"". Without teachers to help guide them in the classroom, majority of students would be on their phones, sleep, or be with their friends all day.

Overall, online learning would be ill-fitting for my generation and others to come because it destroys creativity, does not help one in the real world, and would be difficult for teenagers due to their lack of motivation. While, some may see it as a new and improved way for students to learn, be independent, and serve as a convenience; the negatives out way the positives in too many ways, especially the health of adolescent teenagers.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3741D275F8BC,"Some people think that taking classes from home is a easy way to study without having to leave home. While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer.

One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things.

Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet source. There could be paces where getting good

Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue have people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home.

One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than trough the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person .People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side.

Meanwhile people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it. Attending classes from from is not alway a good idea beacuse students would not be inspired,not averyone has acces to internet,and teachers would help students more in person. With all said we can conclud that the best way to study is by attending to school and no from home.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
728C8B788C4C,"A student goes to school to learn, but the school does not have any special learning equipment. There are only a few teachers at the school, and only a few students per class. The entire class the student is constantly hearing his phone go off, and mom talking in the background, which causes him to not even understand the work he is doing. Eventually, his dog comes into his room, so he stops working and plays with the dog. He never fully understood what he was working on, so he just looked up and answer key later and copied it. The student was schooling online using distance learning through his school. Distance learning is not beneficial to students because the student does not get the hands on experience they need, the student does not make advancements socially, and the student gets distracted by things in his home very easily.

First, distance learning does not provide the same hands on experience as an in person school. Schools have a lot of special and expensive learning equipment for students to use. Someone from home would simply not have access to these tools, whether it be for financial reasons or because they do not know where to get it. This would hinder the students education very severely. Many students are afraid or unmotivated to do things until they try it, then they know if they love doing it and realize that it is not that bad after all. A student from home might not want to try new things because they have never had to before. This could seriously harm a students learning and even harm their future career path if it is bad enough.

Second, students learning from home do not make the same social advancements as someone going to school. Students that go to school every day are exposed to people all day. They must make relationships, talk to people, and work with people to survive in the environment. At home, this is not the case at all. A student learning online from his home does not need to talk to people constantly, nor does the student need to work with others all day. This causes a lack of social skill in the student. In a workplace, social skills are important, and students learning online may not have those skills so they will be fired or not even hired in the first place.

Third, students learning from home have enormous amounts of distractions. A normal school has teachers and administrators to make sure students are well behaved and quiet when they need to be. At home, no one is sitting next to a student ready to silence anything that makes a noise around them. Instead, the student must either let it distract them, or deal with it them self, both of which are hindering the learning experience. Constantly being distracted does not allow a student to focus and deeply understand what they are trying to learn. Not understanding important fundamentals leads to a lot of confusion down the road.

Some people may argue that the cost is lowered by online schooling at home. While this may be true, why hinder a young mind's education just to save a little bit of money? Most schools have buses that can take students to and from school. Many schools offer aid to poor families for things like lunch fees, testing fees, field trip fees, etc. Aid will be given to a family if needed. Keeping a student from going to school just to save money is not the way to go.

In conclusion, distance learning would not be beneficial for students. The distractions would restrict deep learning and understanding of concepts. The experience would not be like a career, nothing hands on, only stuff from a computer. Social skills will not be developed in these students, leading to poor communication skills and possibly even bullying. The best thing a school could do for a student is to do what will open up many opportunities for them. This restricts learning and restricts opportunities, so it would not be beneficial for the students. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
6F271187D67D,"Distance learning is an extravagant way of learning for those who don't necessarily have an easy option to go to public schooling. Even though some argue that the social interactions experienced at school help build a person's character; there are many cases where large classrooms actually cripple a student's potential. Distance learning has many benefits such as for people living in rural areas where transportation can be an issue. Distance learning students who have a hard time in social environments can find themselves excelling in the privacy of their home. Less school days would be missed due to the fact that outside weather conditions and school conditions would not be an issue. Also, less money would have to be poured into the transportation system and can be focused on other important aspects of the education system.

To start off, student's living in rural areas have a harder time getting to school and especially through a bus. These student's have to wake up earlier than usual and miss out on more sleep. You could argue that these rides help the student's create new friends but, these student's usually meet outside of school since they live close by. The more sleep and time a student has to themselves, the more successful they will be. Imagine this, a student living in a rural countryside lives about 35 minutes away from his school. Their school starts at around 8:00 AM. The bus would have to make multiple stops and the student's being the first. This would mean that the student would have to be ready to leave in time for the bus to pick them up and endure the rest of the stops. Being this early they would have to be ready by about 7 AM or maybe even earlier. He or she would then have to wake up at a comfortable time maybe 6 AM or earlier. The day before they had homework which they didnt finish until about 5 PM. To get more than 8 hours of sleep at that point you would need to sleep before 10 PM. This leaves the student with not even 5 hours of the day for himself. More time could be allocated to extracurricular activities if the student did not have to worry about getting up in time for the bus.

Secondly, there are many student's who suffer from social anxiety and many other issues with social interaction. distance learning can make a student feel comfortable from learning in their own home. Parents also have more control in a student's performance by being their to guide and support them through their studies. A student studying through distance learning will also be able to have more experience with technology. This added experience and knowledge will be critical in this advancing world. A lot of people will be able to find themselves taking heart to technology related fields or simply giving themselves new found passions. Students who otherwise despise going to school and having to deal with their ailment will find a new found love for school and learning. Take for example, a new high school student who suffers from social anxiety. This student would have to deal with tons of stress from entering a new environment with new people. He or she would be focused on the gratification of his peers while distracting him from his schoolwork. If this student was taking a distance learning program he would not have to force himself through this unnecessary stress. This student would pick up on vital learning abilities needed in high school to help him succeed in his upcoming years. Otherwise, without this type of program, the student could miss out on important opportunities through the stress and turmoil of worrying about his peers and image.

Also, a lot of school is missed due to bad road conditions or weather. Distance learning can help make sure that less days are missed so that students can stay on task. People who are critical to this topic could say that bad weather could take out energy thus making it useless, however these conditions rarely become bad enough to take out power sources. Student's without power would have more issues to deal with that would also disrupt their learning, so it would only be logical that learning for that day should be halted. There are more scenarios where distance learning would help in these conditions rather than have no impact. For example, on a snowy day, roads are too dangerous for buses and drivers to come to school. With distance learning, students would have the ability to still experience a full school day without their learning be crippled by transportation.

Finally, less money would be spent on transportation and less stops would have to be made. This could save student's more time in the mornings, and save the school money to enhance their learning experience. Buses would have less mileage and more gas. Student's who drive wouldn't have to worry about expenses towards their transportation. Also larger amounts of people can be accommodated by the school due to less people being physically in the classroom. More money could also mean raises to teachers which would satisfy the ongoing issue of teachers feeling like they aren't paid enough. Students will also be more enticed in a school career due to a larger salary. Schools will run a lot more smoothly and the field would be infinitely more respected by the new generation.

In conclusion, distance learning has a lot of benefits and brings forth solutions to modern problems. Students taking distance learning can better understand technology and how they feel about it. It would come to no surprise if we saw an increase of teachers and computer scientists due to the implementation of this program. School offices would be thrilled to use less money on transportation, and to see students enjoy their success without the turmoil of going through unwanted social interaction. Distance learning is an example of how technological evolution brings forth great changes to everyday life, and how we can get into a healthier mindset of change in the school system.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
5902D762C891,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing? my opinions students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, sometime students doesn't have time when students free they will be done online class or homework, test,assessment. some students doesn't have parents so,they need to work and make money pay for rent and food. some time they will be sick and they won't attend class. some time students take action and going to visiting some place they will be attend online classes. now every area social online. Students use phone they will looking for YouTube,and they learn some think there video. when students doing online classes attend if they didn't know that they will be taping the Google and students get some information.

First, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, sometime students doesn't have time when students free they will be done there homework,test, assessment. some word students doesn't understand but they will be taping on the phone and translation from another languish or they will be looking for dictionary. where students doesn't matter because they will be doing online class any area, any place. example:-1. students traveling to bus workplace,rest time, talk to another person. many parent think students does,t leading any think at home they are always use the phone and play game, taxing masses,talk to another person said parent, But not like that one because they will leading some think there. student taxing another person students learning to spell correct. when student talk to friend the will learn to correct tone.

Second, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because,some students doesn't have parents so, they need to work and make money pay for rent and food. Students work a lot so,students not attend classes. i know how will be going to schools they leaning a lot. when students not understand teacher enplane every think and explain math. at schools have time what time students enter the class what time go to next class and what time lunch every think teacher make time table. students follow the rule. some students it's fine this rule some students it's not find this rule. So, students at home take online classes they will be make a time table. Schools have teacher to learn and at home we have friend,brother and sister every body teach them. if students does't have a family they will call the friend and talk and discourse to the project and homework. My be they doing go to Google and taping problem sentence and students gets some answer. Students learn to fast looking for video.

Third, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, some time students will be sick and students won't attend classes. if that time students have online classes students doing homework and project,assessment at hospital and at home. Students sitting in the hospital they are boring if students have some attend class they are doing some online classes. And they students have time going to fast. Students attend classes finish they doing some plan. But, students doesn't to make plant January is to rarely to know this information because, students plan after depend school on there teacher and consular. And summer , winter vacation too and there plane my be change. So, students,would benefit from being able to attend classes from at home.

Finally, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, now every area social online. So, some time students take vacation and going to visiting some place and they will be attend onion classes. students use of cellphone with at home and work traveling time so students attend online classes. schools have five day a week a class so students want to spent time with family. students want to go to vacation with family looking for new place. students want to all the time free. they don't want stay one place. When students will be go to new place students mind fresh and they think they will be doing every thing. So online classes should benefit for students. When student mind fresh there mind new think they learn new word. So students active doing every thing and students tell there friends and they will be decide go to there pace. There are learn for social and active physic subject.

In conclusion, students should be benefit from being able to attend classes from home now every area social online so, use of cellphone and computer,lop tap with doing attend the classes at home. we are looking for video and talk with friend,we are learn some think there video. if students have online classes students make some plan going out side with family and friends and students doing to attend online classes.

E1C96D7A8110,"Going to school is supposedto be a wondrful time of your life; a time where you should be basking in the glory of all your youth and making some mistakes along the way. There are those who join cheer leading, or football, or those who join multiple clubs because they simply just cannot stay with one. That is the American dream, to live the best years of your life, in high school. It seems like a great idea, something that everyone should have. Unfortunately, that isn't the case for everyone. While it might seem fun to have classes with your friends and join clubs, not everyone's school experience is what it should be. Everyone should be able to have equal learning opportunity and quality, even if they work from home.

Maintaining good grades can be a struggle for some students; there can be a million things school can do to blow your focus. We are taught at a young age that you should always strive to get the A, because that is considered a perfect score. For some people, achieving that ""A"" is no problem at all; with that they end up feeling confident and secure. For others, maintaining average grades can already be a struggle for them; and when they dont receive that perfect score that everyone is talking about, they become insecure. Without feeling that constant pressure to be perfect, surrounded by their peers; it gives those people more time to focus and do the absolute best that they can.

There is already a large amount of competition in schools, to join a sport or a robotics club or to be smart enough and qualify to get on the debate team. There are some people that could advocate that being in a school environment helps to push a student out of their comfort zone, and to try harder. Sometimes for those children, who have been suffering in silence, enough is enough.

Going to a new school can be tough on any kid. Going to a school you have been going to for a long time without really knowing anybody can have the same effect. Being lonely as a child in a place full of people who have the ability to be social and speak out, can give them some very unwanted feelings of anxiety. Many children to this date suffer from anxiety because the school environment just becomes too much for them. The pathway to attending a school where you feel anxious and lonely can pave the way to more serious mental health issues, such as depression. Having all of that effect the quality of the school work they are able to provide; it would be much better to have them learn and thrive in a place where they can feel comfortable, and safe. Safe from excessive worried thoughts and insecurities. A small price to pay, for the stability of a child's mental health.

Not everyone's home life is a picture perfect story, sometimes there can be more going on with someones life then you could possibly imagine. Teenagers who have a sick or single parent might drop everything to help with whatever they can. Going to school everyday, and caring for their parent will usually effect one of the quality of their work, making it that much more difficult to strive in school. Everything is not all black and white; there can be more to a persons story and how they cope and manage to find ways to still get what they need. It takes dedication and hard work to do what some kids couldn't. Living a stable life on a one paycheck or even two paycheck family can be difficult on children. Why put kids through more pressure than they already experience by having them work around a strict schedule?

Distance learning has become one of the best things to happen to schools, because it has provided security and reassurance to those who have more complicated lives then most. Who struggle mentally or physically. The benefits a working student could have from being able to complete their work right in the comfort of their own home. Not having to worry all day because you feel lonely and anxious can relax your mental state. There are students who thrive being in a school environment, who ace tests, have friends and join clubs. Its wonderful that that way of learning can benefit them. Its still important to remember, not everyone's school experience is the same, and not everyone benefits from the same things.           ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
46B92194BDB8,"Knowledge is power. Without it there can be no inventors, innovators, leaders, or progression of society as a whole. This concept is the purpose of education, the transmission of knowledge. Educating the younger generations is a major aspect of modern society. It is crucial for the progression of the human race. However, like all things, education is constantly adjusting to new discoveries and technologies. Online classrooms are being offered as an alternative to physically attending classroom sessions. Online education will benefit students much less than in class sessions by decreasing learning quality through ineffective education methods.

Lack of structure that comes with attending class from home will lead to an increase in procrastination among students which in turn will decrease their quality of learning. Five day school weeks with consistent schedules provide students with some sort of structure to their education. Without a schedule assisting students with time management, they become accountable for their own learning. This is an issue because most adolescents don't have a passion for knowledge or simply do not know why they have to go to school which makes it difficult to invest their time into something they do not really want to do. For example, I am passionate about lacrosse. I am willing and able to invest consistent time and effort into improving my stick skills, strength, and endurance. With school, on the other hand, I find it difficult to invest the same amount of time and effort into a class or specific assignment I simply don't have that much interest in. It is not until I am forced to complete an assignment by a due date, or study for an upcoming assessment that I put in the effort necessary to succeed. However, with a structured number of hours that I must attend school each week, I am forced to absorb the knowledge required to eventually complete the work due in my classes. Most students who are not super passionate about school would much likelier not pay attention in an online class, or not even attend altogether. Online sessions will be ineffective on student participation, leading students to a lower quality of learning or even complete lack of education. It is completely dependent on the student's thirst for knowledge, which may not be that important to them.

For the students who find some importance in education, it will be difficult to engage in effective communication without physical interaction with the educator which may increase confusion and lower learning quality. Student and teacher interactions in person can develop connections and a sense of trust that will help students better understand the concepts that specific teacher is teaching them. Online classrooms put a physical barrier between teachers and students which prevent any of these interactions. For example, my chemistry class does a flipped classroom, which is a teaching style where students are sent home to watch videos on the concepts of chemistry that we will later apply in class. I could wrap my head around some concepts, but some things just seemed unclear. When practicing writing out chemical reactions on my own, I had many questions that I needed to write out with my teacher in order to clarify. It was not until I came into class that I could sit down with my teacher and write out reactions with her that I fully grasped onto the concept. Similar to myself, it seems like most of my peers are hands on learners, where they understand concepts best when actually applying them and going through a process. This is an effective learning style consisting of developmental progression through the medium of a mentor, which in this case is the teacher. Online sessions lack this physical medium students can work with in order to fully understand concepts they are being taught, leading to ineffective education that will not benefit students.

Social interactions and collaboration with peers is a beneficial learning aspect that cannot be accessed at home. The classroom provides a social setting for students to work with each other, ask each other questions, and create connections that one otherwise could not at home. Class with friends makes education just a little more enjoyable. It is the slightest incentive for students to come to school with a smile on their face. I absolutely despise the subject of Calculus, but it is a class a have with some good friends and a teacher that I trust and respect. One morning I strolled into the classroom without a care in the world, until I was greeted with a test on derivatives that completely slipped my mind and I did not study for. One of my friends was in the same boat, which provided some sort of comfort. Our other friend quickly tutored us as we panicked to prepare for the test. We bounced questions off each other in quick, effective communication and suddenly I felt comfortable and prepared. I took my time, thought critically and made my way through each problem. I remembered my friends familiar voice and it guided me to completion. She was the reason I had passed the test. Communication with peers I have bonded with helped me to understand a topic effectively and efficiently. This is a huge benefit to education that is impossible to take advantage of through a screen.

The school system provides the adolescent generations with a structured path to developing knowledge as well as connections with fellow students and teachers that will greatly benefit them on their journey. Introducing online classrooms into education breaks the structure and neglects these important aspects to developing a quality understanding of knowledge effectively. Effective education is the gateway to a progressive future and the betterment of society as a whole. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
7600F1C7D884,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.

Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.

When your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.

Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.

In conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
A091ADA0095F,"School has notably been one of the best years of a person's life. It has provided people with lifelong friends, partners, and memories. Recently, however, there has been a group of people speaking out about how schooling from home is the better option. Students should get their education at school because interactive projects teach better than computer assignments, the student would acquire more social skills, and teachers would have a better opportunity to educate and connect with their students.

The first reason why students should attend school is because interactive projects teach better than computer assignments. Projects give the student the opportunity to break down the subject and really understand it. For example, a student might be assigned to create a model of a plant cell. The student would then have to start at the first part and have to understand what it looks like and what it does in order to make an accurate model. Computers provide only a picture with no opportunity to understand the subject on a physical level. School is also the only place a student would be able to complete a physical project because there is no way to turn it in from home. As one can see, interactive projects educate a student better than a computer assignment.

The second reason why students should attend school is so they develop or improve their social skills. At home, there is nobody to socialize with. School is, of course, full of people that matches the student's age and interests. Conversing with others teaches children what to say, what not to say, and how to act. The social skills they learn can be directly used to make connections with friends or coworkers later in life. These skills are essential to living a happy and healthy adult lifestyle. It is obvious that attending school would teach students better social skills than staying at home.

The last reason students should attend school is so teachers have more of an opportunity to teach and connect than the student being at home. Many people would say that one of their teachers from school was a major influence on their life. At school, teachers can connect face to face, and through that strong bond, more learning will happen. The computer at home would make it seem that the teacher is just another program and they would not be as motivated. Teachers would also be more motivated to teach well in front of a classroom rather than a computer camera. It is apparent that students attending school will give the teachers a better opportunity to teach and connect with the students.

The main point made by the opposition is that learning from home is not as stressful as getting up, getting dressed, and going to school on time. These exact tasks teach students how to be timely and responsible. These two skills will be needed in order to maintain a job as an adult and even when their still in school. Learning from home will not support these skills nearly as much as they need to be. It is also important to learn how to access these skills when stressed, so the little stress a student endures at school is actually beneficial to them.

Students should be required to attend school because hands-on projects allow a student to learn more than an assignment on the computer, attending school provides the student the opportunity to gain social skills, and the teachers could connect and educate students more than through a screen. The future of America starts in every school, not home. School is necessary to ensure that society keeps moving forward. If the adults of tomorrow are not taught correctly, than the impact would be bigger than just an individual. Communities should urge their school districts to discontinue this poor education plan, and fully implement the requirement to attend school and learn along side their peers who will change the world for the better. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
2AD8A9FEE4C0,"From the early ages of preschool, to the later stages of high school and potentially college, a majority of people spend their days sitting and learning in the classroom of a school building. Though this has been the classic way of learning for years, what if there was a way to change the original style of student education? Our society has been built off of the idea that being educated should be in a school, where many people feel uncomfortable and face harsh social judgment. Distance learning from home, by online or video conferencing, is a beneficial option because it is convenient, helps avoid social pressure, and allows one to be educated in a comfortable environment.

One reason distance learning from home is a strong option for education is because it is convenient. A majority of children or adults enrolled in a school where they must physically attend the classes spend half of their troubles finding ways of transportation. Not only do they have to find a way to school, but they must also find a way home, which may bring up conflicts within a family or oneself. A large amount of money may be put into these transportation options, or risks with safety may occur. Also, money has to put into other items needed for school such as backpacks, clothing, unnecessary school supplies, etc. By learning online, rather than in a classroom, students are provided with an easy, cheaper option. It allows people to still gain the same knowledge, but on their own time and schedule. Students will no longer have to stress about working around the schools schedule, because they will be able to take the classes at the most suitable times for themselves.

Another reason learning by online or video conferencing in ones home is beneficial is because it helps avoid social pressure. One of the biggest issues in our world today has to do with comparing oneself to others. Mental struggles and illnesses have been increased over the years because of the influence and negative mindset built up by those around us. Whether it is grades, personality, appearance, etc. our society is constantly brought down by one another. Being educated at home allows people to limit their exposure to this constant pressure put on by teachers, or peers. Their confidence will be boosted, and those being taught at home will create a better ability to learn because the comparison of others abilities will not be shown.

Learning from home is also a good idea because it allows students to be educated in a comfortable environment. Having to sit in a desk, or stand in a room that is not too familiar to one may cause a disadvantage to the students education. For the student to be at home, where they get to choose the most suitable spot for themselves, they will learn easier. Discomfort in a students learning area leads to a distraction that causes a negative impact, but by eliminating this, the student is one step closer to a stronger education. Though some people believe that being at home creates more distractions, this view can be seen as false because the distractions of others and discomfort are eliminated in the at home learning process.

By using at home, online education it allows our society to create an easy, stress-free, and suitable process of learning.

The early years of life are some of the most important, because it is when people begin to figure out who they are and their main purpose of life. Through this new style of learning, our society will begin to free themselves from the thoughts of others, and be able to form a confident and strong lifestyle for their successes of the future.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0BB4037BFB98,"Learning from home thought the power of the internet. Google was founded in 1998 so this is in many ways a new concept but a crucial one at that. Online learning opens up possibilities for people who may not be able to make it to school, When natural disasters and viruses prevent kids from going to school, and providing education to those less fortunate.

First, people with disability and medical conditions that prevent them from attending school. When it come to having a disability or medical condition can really make it hard for a family to make sure their child is getting educated; thats why I believe its crucial that public schools offer online/alternate learning outlets. My mom got pneumonia and was in in school at the time her teacher was really understanding and offered to Skype and help catch up on missed material; she also did this while my mother was pregnant. When my mom passed her bar exam her teacher bought her and the whole family tickets to go to kings dominion.

Furthermore, natural disasters and biological hazards. One issue we may be getting ready for is the corona virus I know this coming up Monday we dont have school to prep teachers on the possibly of teaching from home do to this outbreak. Imagine a flood, earthquake, hurricane, or a tornado all very real possibilities that could be just right around the corner and we dont know it. That why I think we need to have mass alternative learning systems that can continue education when events like this do happen.

Finally, providing education to those less fortunate or those who may not jive well with the traditional way of schooling. All kids in the United States have the right to an education regardless of economic status. Many kids live in very dangerous areas that expose them to things like gangs and drugs, so having an option for parents to opt out of traditional schooling would greatly reduce these dangerous behaviors. Some kids have trouble going along with day to day schooling. options like TSRC make it possible for these kids to succeed as well.

In conclusion, providing and having alternative learning options in place make it possible for education to continue even when tradition means are not possible. I believe a lot is being done to make this a reality with one to one computers but there is still more work to do in many less fortunate areas of the US. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
DE6623432646,"Distance learning should be an option for students and would prove to be very effective. Learning at home by the use of online or video chat would be helpful in many ways. Students can learn even though they may be sick, students will be able to focus in a more stable environment, and they will be able to learn at their own pace. Overall, there are more pros than cons of distance learning and this would be a more efficient way to teach students.

Through distance learning, students will still be able to learn if they are not feeling well enough to go to school. If someone has the flu or a common cold it would be best for them to stay at home. When students are at home, whether it be they are sick or just tired, they will not fall behind in class. Even if students are sick and may not feel like learning, distance learning would provide an easily accessible way to learn or study that may not be too hard on students. Another pro of distance learning is when students are sick, they will not be able to pass around their sickness to other students, which would benefit the health of other students in the area. When students get sick they tend to do less work and sleep more, so it is better for it to happen to one kid, rather than a whole class of students. Distance learning would take away the possibility of getting sick from a fellow classmate which, in turn, will increase productivity for students.

A main reason why distance learning should be available to students is because many students find it hard to stay focused and on task in class. There are many distractions in class including friends, texts, and the constant urge to get up out of your seat. Having friends in your class may be fun, but also may be a problem for the student's focus. Humans are a generally social species, so if students have friends in class they will feel the urge to talk to friends instead of staying on task. In addition to stunting students' focus, many students have trouble sitting in uncomfortable school desks for hours at a time without breaks to stretch their legs and rest. Not moving around makes peoples muscles stiff and can cause pain and make students uncomfortable, which can add to the problem of not sitting still and focusing. Distance learning would eliminate these problems because at home students would be able to relax in a comfortable, stable environment and students will not have friends there as a distraction.

All students learn at different paces, and distance learning helps with this as well. Students may get bad grades in class and even fail. This may not be due to the lack of knowledge, but to the lack of control of the pace in which they learn. Students who learn at a slower pace have a harder time keeping up with all of their school work, in return, they fall way behind and have a hard time catching up. Working at home at their own pace will increase grades and their motivation to keep working and keep their grades up. Students who learn at a faster pace will also benefit from this because if they work faster, students could possibly finish courses early and have opportunities to take more classes or even have free time for leisure activities. No matter which way a student learns, distance learning will benefit students of all learning natures and help them stay on track.

Although distance learning has many benefits, a con to this issue may be that students procrastinate and feel that they want to relax more if they are at home. When students are at home they feel comfortable and they feel that they have all the time in the world to work from home so they do other activities instead of schoolwork. Students may get distracted due to chores, watching TV, or scrolling through Instagram and Snapchat. Another downside is that students might lack moral support from their teachers, nagging them to get their work done. With teachers nagging their students, they might feel the urge to complete more work instead of getting distracted and dozing off. These reasons are some of very few that students should learn in a classroom environment as opposed to distance learning.

Distance learning would be a very effective way for students to learn and stay on top of schoolwork. This method of learning should be available for students everywhere. Whether students would want to participate in distance learning or not, it would be beneficial to many kids and lead to better grades. Students will be able to learn when they are sick, they will be able to focus better, and they would be free to learn at their own pace that is right for them. This is why distance learning would benefit many students.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
E6BF8D197E0D,"Students would have more benefits taking online classes from home than going to school that is far away from where they are. Online classes would have huge impact in students lives which is going to solve many problems. I think students would have the benefits to take online classes from home instead of going to a far school which is causing them to wake up early to catch up the bus, waste time, spend money and stress. This can be change if students are allowed to take online classes from home.

Students would have more benefits taking online classes from home than going to school, one of the main reason I said this is because of waking up early. For example, my daily life is waking up early to go to my bus stop because from my house is 30 minutes away and I have to walk where is dark outside like around 6:00am. Any student that walks in the morning in the darkest there is some chances to get in risk because bad people are outside to harm innocent people. My mom is always concern that I have to wake up early and walk in the darkest, she tries to change her work schedule more later but she can't but she always call me to make sure I get safe to my bus stop. I think this is one of the reason online classes can benefits students by protecting them.

Online classes from home would help students and their family to have time management. Sometimes students have to go to a doctor appointment which cause their parents to get out of work and go all the way to school and then go to the doctor with a lot of rushed because time goes fast. For example, in my personal experience sometimes I have a doctor appointment which cause my mom to pick me up from school and then go to the doctor but after that she has to pick up my siblings from the babysitter which is going to get her tired from driving too much and also wasting time which shouldn't been different if I had the chance to stay at home and do online classes, my mom and I wouldn't have to rushed to go to doctor appointment and cook for the family. My mom works everydays at 4:00am and she has to take my siblings to the babysitter to early even when is freezing. I will like to help her taking care of my siblings by taking online classes from home instead of going to school, therefore my mom and I would have use the time wisely.

Online classes for students will benefits their family economy. Instead of buying a lot of supplies and clothes to go to school would prevent them to spend too much money. One example related to my life is when schools are about to open and my mom has to save money to buy me supplies and clothes to go to school which would cause her to work more and save. Also in our society some families have problems with their economy which would be difficult for them to buy their kids supplies and clothes which would cause them to sell items from their houses. If online classes are provided to students it would benefits students family including mine because my mom is not going to waste money on babysitting,gas,clothes and supplies as usual.

Online classes for students will benefits their health of not stressing anymore. Some students stress a lot about what clothes they have to wear to school which is going to cause them to over think a lot. Stress is really serious problem because students feel stresses out when they go to school because of not having time management or not having enough sleep. Online classes will prevent students to get bullied in school. Stress is a really common symptoms between students and should be preventable for the safe of our students. For example, when I have to wake up early I stress a lot because I have to get ready fast and walk to my bus stop and sometimes I skipped breakfast because I study when I get to school. If they provided me online classes I will have stress but not that much as I usually did in school because I will have more time to sleep and eat breakfast which would help me stay mentally healthy.

I think students would have the benefits to take online classes from home instead of going to a far school which is causing them to wake up early to catch up the bus, waste time, spend money and stress. Students would have time to spend time with their family and communicated more to each other often and informed their parents about their problems. Online classes would impact our lives in a positive way to help students stay home safe, have time management, have a stable economy and less stress for the good of our lives.          ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

74C44149CA38,"Learning would not occur if kids were told to do it themselves, whenever they wanted. The integration of online classes in school causes a detrimental decline in learning. The schedule and structure of school prepares students for college and their jobs after school. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because learning is most efficient in a classroom setting, social interactions are important, and more dropouts would occur due to online classes.

Looking at a computer screen for hours at a time can affect one's mental state and ability to comprehend new information. Learning is most efficient in a classroom setting where students can ask questions and collaborate with their peers. Students are able to discuss topics in group settings and get a deeper understanding of the material. In addition, students are more likely to keep up with their homework due to the encouragement of their peers, while online students often struggle do to the lack of motivation to get their work turned in on time. Classroom learning sets students up for success.

Online classes have a negative impact on the overall growth of students due to the lack of social interactions. Looking at a computer will not give kids the social skills they need in order to be successful. Having face-to-face conversations with their teacher, giving presentations in front of their whole class, and having group discussions are all things that online students miss out on. Those interactions lead to a greater understanding of the topics and students will remember giving a presentation rather than submitting a PowerPoint online. Social interactions are an important aspect in learning.

Online classes will lead to an increase in the number of dropouts. Students will take advantage of the freedom and flexibility of the courses and will not be motivated to get their work done. School provides a much needed structure for kids to learn in a controlled environment without outside factors getting in the way. There are too many external factors at home that can prevent students from learning to their full potential. Students will no longer be motivated to learn and ,therefore, more dropouts will occur.

Although it may sound convenient, online courses would do much more harm than good. Kids get distracted with their everyday lives and school is a structured place from them to learn. Learning in a classroom setting gives students the preparation they need for jobs after school.

F38B43CAEEEB,"There are billions of people in this world and everyone learns differently. Normally, students will take their classes in person at a public or private school. Distant learning should be another method of education that students are allowed to try out. This allows students to learn the same topics anyone else would but with the luxury of being at home. Distant learning would be beneficial because it can provide students a way to learn responsibility,allow them to learn at their own style, and provides safety.

Firstly, by providing distant learning students are able to establish important life skills such as responsibility. This program will allow students to take responsibility on their own by getting their work done. This means the students will have to establish their time management skills so that they complete all of their lessons,quizzes,tests and homework on their own. This is an essential life skill because in the real world no one will be holding their hand or checking up on them to make sure they do what their supposed to. This is great because students can become self motivated to get their stuff done and do this all in their own style.

Secondly, distant learning allows students to learn at their own style. This means students will have the liberty to work at their own pace and use their own methods. There are plenty of different kinds of learners and everyone learns material at different paces. Some people learn material quickly whereas others need more time to fully understand the material. Students will also be able to use the internet to find methods that work best for them. For example, one student can find the general way math is taught easier and others are able to find new ways to learn math that work best for them. This way students can learn however works best for them but still be able to understand and get through all the same material everyone else does.

Lastly, being able to learn from home provides safety to the students. Nowadays there are many concerns from parents about their children going to school because of school shooting,fires, and many other circumstances. By students being able to get their education at home, this brings reassurance to parents that their children will be safe. This also allows parents to make sure their children are being fed good food and are provided with all the resources they need. The students being at home lifts a weight off parents shoulders and eliminates their fear of their child being in any kind of danger.

In conclusion, distant learning should be allowed as an option for students to take. Although, some may say that students need a teacher for guidance but students shouldn't depend on one because their won't always be someone there to guide them. Distant learning builds essential skills such as responsibility that is needed in the real world. It also provides a safe environment for students to learn in and gives parents a sense of relief about their safety. Finally, distant learning gives all different types of people a way to learn that is unique to them because everyone is different and everyone deserves a right to seek education. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
ACEDBB3C81A0,"They say some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace.

Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you don't have people around you to stop you or distract you. One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudn't because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades.

One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we can't change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home. I had a problem at freshman year that i've got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didn't knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudn't have to face this problem every school day. In this case being abble to attend school at home helps a lot of students.

Allthrough, attend school at home got some issues too, when you attend school at home you don't socialize, you don't get to know a lot people, One of my favorite soccer player once said that ""the only thing that attending school at home does not help is at socializing, meeting new people."" that's of the reason not a lot people attend school at home, because they like to meet new friends, being together with people that you like.

Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, you can focus more and you is a option that you can take if you have any obstacle in your way at school such as bullying or something like that, nowadays is more common to see people taking online classes. All the schools should have online classes that you can take at home so every student can study the way they want to study;Therefore, students benefit by being able to attend classes at home.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

There is an option for students to take EPF over the summer at home as opposed to during the school year, which is very helpful to students who want to get one of their graduation requirements done quickly. Since they don't have to take the class during the school year, it would give them the time for other classes that they may need to graduate. It would also let them take elective classes that could either prepare them for their desired career, or simply make their school year more fun. Some may say that they would rather not have to take time out of their summer to take EPF. This isn't a very good reason, as taking the class over the summer would still be far shorter due than taking the class over an entire school year.

Since it's online I could take every single one of these assignments, excluding the tests, at home and save myself plenty of time. If I took everything at home, I could simply do work for another class, go on my phone, or even take a nap. Others could say that since my class isn't completely online, I benefit more than if it was completely online. However, people who don't even go to high school or college can still use the Testout service and use the same resources and get the same information as I get in my class.

Colleges also have several online alternatives to their classes. At Generic_School we had a college visit where some of their classes had the option to be taken online, and students would most likely benefit from those classes just as much as the on-campus courses. The opportunity for students to take college courses at home removes one of the many boundaries keeping them from going to the college they want, which is distance. This allows them to get a good education at the school of their choice without having to travel across the country to get there. Some may say that if there isn't a professor in the room watching them as they work, they could cheat or simply refuse to do the work. This may not be as big of an issue some may think, because if students don't complete their work on time and in full they will fail the class, and there are ways to deter or detect cheating such as the plagiarism checking feature in Google Classroom.

It is important to get students the education they need in whatever form possible whether it be in a classroom or through online courses. In the past people had no option to take classes online if they couldn't attend school and either had to be home schooled, or simply take the classes later when they were able to. In the future, students should be able to learn in whatever way is best for them depending on their circumstances. Students and parents should make themselves aware of what's out there and try to convince their schools to provide more options for distance learning to help make students' lives a lot easier.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
14EE006078C4,"Some student can learn to attend classes from home. And I think it's a great way to learn if you want some good grades. If I wanted to learned; I would stayed at school or watch a video to how to English, biology, or what classes do I chose from. But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live.

Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website can't be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered.

Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures.

Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like you're teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it.

The way I see is online is a helpful and video conference is helpful too. But I think it like home school staying at home and studied online or video conference. So my reasons is it a way to learned fast, getting good grades, or other information that you need for the future. And here a other reason why to use online or video conference. Online is been update like a few times. For example lets say Google doc. Google doc has been one the greatest website that I ever used. In that website, you can do almost everything like book project, essay, making slide shows and other helpful tools. But video conference is pretty helpful too. And my example is like if I need help I can contact my fellow people to help me.

Finally the best way to learned is sometimes online for helpful website and video conference to contact if teacher or other can help me. But I likely used online because it pretty helpful because let say I forgot a textbook and my homework is due the next day. Well I can go online and check my answer if i got it right. And I sometime I always used online to see if how to bake a cake or other information that I need.",2,Distance learning,Independent,0.2

And online classes is helpfull for students who wants to be educeted. And also for students who are serious about studies. Online classes is d someone who wants to do smething for their futuer to have a bright life. Online classes is great option for several reasons.

Firse, everyone is not that much fortunte to be educeted or to have chance for study when they are youn. Like me I borne in that country, that the women do not had chance to study. 80% of women is uneduceted, I am on of them.

Now I have kids, the online option is a great idea for me. Because I have to take care of my children beside of my education.

Second, if student wants to be educeted the online classes is a very good option to be them if they can not reach schools. Coming to school is not a point, to get knowledge is a big point. It does not essential to have to go to school get clacces. You can get knowledge whowever you want.

Third, for serious student it does not metter if the classes is online or it is unonline they will get what they need. Like me it does not emportent for me net classes or joyinable classes, I wants to go a head and fonish my school first than I will cuntinue my education.

8192F4D79528,"School is a place for students to learn and grow. The opportunity to go to school is one that should never go overlooked, especially when there are people around the world who are denied the chance for education. As Americans, we are incredibly lucky to be able to attend schools in our developing years. Online school is a growing trend across the country. In my county, one can take a class or two online throughout the school year. Some people use this as an opportunity to get ahead on graduation requirements; others use it to clear up space in their schedule. Regardless of why people choose online school, it is a wonderful opportunity for students to have. Students would benefit from the opportunity to take online classes because some kids have a tough personal life, online classes teach responsibility, and the world is quickly evolving into the technological age.

Sometimes life throws curve balls at you. It is impossible to predict what will come next. At any moment, someone could be diagnosed with a medical ailment that takes them out of school. When this happens, the opportunity to learn is stripped away from a child. With the inclusion of a program that allows students to attend class while not being on campus, these kids can still have the chance to continue on with their studies. Another example would be a child dealing with mental illness. As a person diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, I know what it is like to feel too scared and too low to leave your house. During my sophomore year of high school, my father suffered a stroke. My world was completely shaken up, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to school. The combination of my turbulent home life and my raging mental illness caused me to spend many days out of school. I fell behind, and my grades suffered the consequences. This led me to fall into a deeper hole of mental illness; not even my grades were going well. Taking things day by day, I've done a lot of healing. I come to school most days, and my grades are as good as they've ever been. With this being said, I still have my struggles with mental illness. My family, along with the help of my doctors, has been pushing for the county to allow me to finish off high school through online school. This process has not been easy, but I am very lucky to be in an area where online classes are already offered. I am not the only teenager with mental illness, so I am sure there are other kids going through this. If more schools had a virtual classroom opportunity, it would help thousands of children in the long run.

Taking an online class requires a level of discipline that not all students have. You are in charge of logging into class, doing the homework, and making sure you understand the material. Being able to take an online class would teach many kids responsibility, and it would also instill a strong work ethic. If you didn't pass the class, you wouldn't get the credit. I feel like many students could learn from the opportunity to be in charge of their class. This prepares for college, where there is consequence for missing class. When kids are too used to relying on their teachers to keep them on track, it can lead to bad habits and poor work ethic. Because of this, online school should be an option to more students.

There are many people who do not agree with the idea of online schooling. The most prominent concern would have to be that the internet does not allow for the hands on, intimate learning experience one can get from sitting face to face with a teacher. It is proven that the best way to retain information is to write it down, pen to paper. Though this is true, it is important to take into account that the world around us is changing. As we move through the 21st century, more and more of our surroundings are digital. I myself have experienced a major shift in the school system; most of my school work is completed on my county issued Chrome Book, for example. The library is full of E-Books, companies do their work online, and there are jobs centered entirely around being on a computer all day. It is evident that there is a climate emergency on Earth, and the use of paper is not helping. Online classes would reduce the amount of paper waste schools go through, and would also limit the amount of paper needed. This has a positive impact on the environment, and I think it is important to take these things into account.

Overall, it is clear to see that there are major benefits found in an online school system. Students can benefit from the ability to stay in school, even when life gets tough. They can also learn what it means to be responsible, and practice living in our world of technology. For these reasons, I believe that schools should offer an online learning program.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
4353BF70C4A3,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools goal is to offer for students classes from home to make sure students do their best in order to pass and graduate. Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students love the idea of taking their courses at home, will have more time to do any activities they could not do in school day time, and its more easier.

First, students love the idea of taking classes at home because students do not have to wake up early for school, that give students more time to sleep and all of us know how important to get your daily hour sleep on our brains. Also, it's good for students who are shy for what ever reasons. I know someone who took classes at home for third and fourth quarters, so he didn't have to go to school. The classes he took started at six PM every Monday and Wednesday. This guy told me that online classes were helpful for him and made him pass.

Second, students will have more time to do any activities. Schools started at eight AM and ends at three PM. At this time, students could do any thing like working in the morning time or help parents in anything or do anything else. Students could use this seven hours to do anything that may help them in the future. As I said before, online classes start at six PM and ends at eight PM. Generic_Name, my closest friend, took classes at home, so he could work and get money.

Students take classes at home at home because it's more easier. Many students said that is better to take our classes at home because it's more easier and teachers teach in really simple way that make anyone understand than what school do. Students wants to pass so they takes the easy way that the school offer to pass, and as I said before, schools offer distance learning to make students succeed. Generic_Name, one of my best friends, took online classes, and he told me that's his teacher was really good because of the way that the teacher taught them back then, makes everything easier and simple that even a kid could understand it.

Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home not just because it's easy or can attend it from home. Schools goal is to make sure we succeed on this classes, and that's what schools here for. Is to open the way for us to create the future because if students are 20% of our present, they are 100% of our future. Some people or students do not like the idea of taking classes from home and will disagree with me. After all everyone have his own way of thinking and living.

95D5978B9E59,"Has it became harder for you to be able to wake up in the morings for school? Teens now a days spend long nights on their phones or chatting with friends and they aren't well rested for the next day. This causes students to fall asleep in class, and they lack the attetion needed throughout the day. Imagine being able to wake up around 10 in the morning on a weekday, still be home and not have to worry about being late to school.

Adults, parents, and even grandparents all have different points of view when it comes to school for thier kids. Some say that a public education helps kids,teens, and even young adults open their eyes at a young age. Schools and teachers start to teach students long life skills, starting from elementary school. Teachers give students work and projects to take home and work on, this is an example of the deveolpement of responsbility. They are expected to get the work done on their own and have it turned in on time. This gives students the idea that work has to be done well and turned back in on time and not taken care of when they have free time.

Students also start to learn to respect not only thmenselves but adults, those around them, and school property. Respecting those around you shows people that you are open-minded and a caring person towards the feelings of others. It is understandable for the parents who want thier kids to attend public schools, it gives them freedom, they get the chance to experience new things and meet new people. Students get to know the feeling of their first game for any school sport, they are even able to attend school dances and after school classes. Public schools are a wonderful oppurtonity that many should take if it's given to them.

On the other hand there are people who prefer their kids to be home-schooled, I agree with thier opinion and these are some of the reasons why. Students who attend public schools have more oppurtonities to experince many new things, they are also loaded with tons of work from many classes. Kids who stay home are abe to sleep in and have more energy throughout the day. They are able to work at their own pace and ask questions they wouldn't normally ask in a classroom full of different students. Kids tends to hold back questions, their opinions, and or problems they have due to the people they are surrounded by. They are scared as to what reaction people will give off, things become different when you are alone with your teacher. You are able to slow things down if needed or move on faster to different topics.

When students are at school there are many activites happening everyday. This causes them to get distracted and are either late to class or forget to do work because they decieded to stay after school for a game, or any after school activites. Being at home allows kids to be focused on thier work, it gives them a quiet place to be able to study for any upcoming exams. Kids are relived and have less stress on thier shoulders, meaning classes are cut down in ways that make it easier for them to understand. The work is lighter and it is taken care of on the spot, in other words the work is turned in on time. Students should consider taking in classes from home, to make their childhoods, and teenage years a little less stressful.

In Conclusion, more parents should be open-minded and considered the idea of their childern taking online classes from home. They will be allowed to do their work at their own time and give their bodied the rest that is needed. Kids, teens, and young adults should not be given extra stress from piles and piles of work everyday. The soother their life goes growing up the better their life will be as they graduate and go on to do what they are passionate for.           ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1FD6E30AAEE1,"As a teenager myself, it is very hard to wake up early in the morning and attend school for 7 hours a day, not including extracaricular acivities. Taking even some of those classes online could benefit students ability to learn with a comfortable learning environment. Sitting in uncomfortable chairs and cold classrooms is not an ideal place to be for a long period of time-- so if students were offered more opprotunities to learn from their own bed, living room, or a coffee shop through a computer, their quality of learning would greatly improve. It would also allow them more independance; because it would be their responsilibilty to get their work done, but an inevidable threat to that is students not putting enough time into the class at home. Although online classes may not be as structured as attending them at school, students are able to work in an environment they are comfortable in, and become more independent due to the resonsibility involved.

Online classes would benefit student's comfort in their learning environment; allowing them to enjoy the experience more. Coming into school 5 days a week and learning 7 classes worth of information is straining to our developing brains, so being able to attend a few of those classes from our homes, a coffee shop, or even while on a vacation would benefit the process. I did an interview with one of my close friends, Generic_Name, whom takes online classes to find out more about the learning environment. ""I love it,"" she said, ""I can sit in my bed and do my english class, or I could put in a pair of earbuds and do it at Starbucks."" Online classes could enable students to choose where they want to work. While a noisey classroom with 30 other kids in it would usually be distracting, the students could decide where they wanted to participate in class that day. Comfort is a key factor in success at learning, and applying that information-- but being uncomfortable is also important. Without discomfort students don't have a good foundation for what to expect in the future, and that's why the learning curve of online classes helps students to develope independence.

Having the resonsibility of ""attending"" and participating in online class sessions is a lot to ask of some teenagers, but it can help them become more indepentent as well. Although online classes would allow more comfort, physically going into school, and sitting in a classroom with a teacher persuades students to do their work-- since there are little alternatives. People with that view could argue that going to school offers more structure for students who need it and don't have the motivation to do the work on their own. Towards the end of my interview with Generic_Name she mentioned that, ""It's hard not having a teacher to work with directly to help me, but I think it has made me a better writer, since I've been having to do a lot of my own writing."" Online classes make students become more independent and ready for their future jobs when they grow up. As many people graduate from high school, they have little knowledge of how college will go, so through these online classes students will, early on, have to adapt to getting their work done on time without the constant reminder of a physical teacher. Though online classes may not feel as structured as attending school, they allow children to gain independence and sense of what to expect in the future; because we won't always have the help we need whenever we need it.

Taking online classes in the comfort of your home or somewhere you feel safe could benefit the way children learn and apply new information, due to the environment they are recieveing the information in. When combined with comfort and new, difficult information, students are able to branch off and experience real world things. As we continue to develope technology, it's important to use it to our advantage and make sure kids not only get the education they need to be successful, but the experience of becoming less reliant on others, and more so on ourselves as well. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8

Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Take a position on this issue. Support your response with reasons and examples.

Many schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Sometime,the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is advantage and disadvantage. In my own thinking, I disagree students wouldn't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they will difficult to interchange, low experience ,less communicate and to affect deployment or presentation in their program.

To begin with, students should have low grade if they didn't face to face interaction with teachers. If you earn a degree from a school with no accreditation, you can find yourself with a worthless degree that will leave you in debt and no better prepared for the workforce. For instance, my friends being to attend classes and he studies online or video conferencing. Some question, he doesn't understand and he has no idea to do his work. So, he has low grade in his work. We need to building relationship with your instructor and classmates will require more effort in an online environment.

Furthermore, students can slow evolution and more work. Program in general are improving the quality of their online courses, and this means that students will have to do more to prove that they've mastered the material. For example, we need to research and find the information in internet. That's make us work for more time and sometime teachers gave them the homework but some students don't do it. Some students destitute responsibilities in their homework. They told teachers with many reason as they need to go work, so they forgot to do homework. But the think is they are got no point and low credit .

Moreover, students need more intense requirement for self-direction because you have to know study online is good or bad for you. However, if you are pursing an entire degree online, you will need to be proactive in finding the information you need to ensure that you are taking the right classes for your degree plan. Students also pass the concentrate when teachers teach them. Beside that,some students destitute responsibilities in their knowledge .Some students mistake in their world when they are writing the paragraph and to impede about success in the future.

Base on this argument, students shouldn't being able to attend classes from home and study in online or video conferencing. I think study in online or video are very bad for you because you will low experience, knowledge, and low contact with your teachers. You have to contact with your teachers because It will help you are more creation,experience and understand about confusion in your paragraph or homework. If you know the positive and negative, you can make an informed decision whether online learning right for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
B5C606F0A883,"Although schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough, actually students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students have more time to sleep and the opportunity of more healthy food.

Some schools said students should not attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. For example, a teacher said students are more lazy and Generic_Name said students don't take classes seriously. In my opinion I think that taking classes at home will be a big problem because students don't do what they supposed to do and also some time students just look at Google to answer what the teacher told to them. Students are not working hard to get want they want, some just said i want to be this or that but they don't put effort in on.

Schools believe that students who take classes at home by way of online or video conferencing are not learning enough. For example, people think students become more interested in other things because they are at home and they can do whatever they want. Generic_Name said that students don't do homework when they attend to an school ,they will not do it at home either. In my opinion all that this people are saying is true because students don't see that what they are doing now can affect they life in the future, because if they to have a diploma they will never have a good job. I think that those schools that want students to take classes at home are making students to be more lazy than they are.

Although some schools said students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students need more time to sleep. A reason is that students need to rest they mind so students can be prepare for the next day of class. Another reason is that students need to sleep at least 9 hours because they always went to bed late. In my opinion students need to sleep well because it is good for our self to sleep the correct hours not too little and not too much.

At this time some schools offer a distance learning program that will let students attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students can eat more deathly food. A example is that the president said that all the students have the right to have a good nutrition. A doctor also said students need a good nutrition because having a good nutrition students can absorb all the learning process. In my opinion this is a good idea because student can have a better nutrition at they on home. Having a good nutrition will make students more strong and they will be able to do many things.

In my position i think students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will never put interest in what the need to do. This idea will just cause problems because is a lie that students will be connected to computer to take the classes. It is not the same to take classes at home that at school because at school students can ask the teacher if they have a question and teacher do what ever she/he need to do to make sure students understand it. To give students the opportunity have classes at home is like give students the option to take classes or not. I believe that finishing schools is a great goal in life is like the firth step to more big stuffs.

Some schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough. I think that is the best because is not good for the students to take classes at home. Those schools who believe students should not take classes at home is because they want the beast for all the students.     ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1A2E1741BF9F,"In the world of education, there have been many arguments about which way of learning could benefit the most people. Some agree that the system we have now is the pinnacle of what we can do to help younger generations learn. However, there is definitely more we could do so the next firemen or police officers in line don't make the same mistakes we have. One of these things is autonomy, the chance to build a new road for one's self. Who wouldn't love the true freedom to become anything by just working to improve skills? One of these bits of autonomy is the chance to try distance learning.

What is distance learning? It is when a child decides to take school from home, online, or have video courses with a teacher. It isn't exactly homeschooling or tutoring, in the sense that instead of having a family member, or specialized teacher come to enlighten; rather, it is when a teacher from the school that the student has probably gone to takes the time to teach one-on-one, along with online courses. As of now, only a percentage of schools allow this, but if this opportunity were introduced to more schools, the whole county would have a higher success overall for two reasons: it helps those who learn better in a small environment, and there isn't the stress of actually going to school.

There are many children all over the world with social anxiety, learning disabilities, or who are just very introverted. When compared to the much more prominent demographic, they are often looked over and left out. If, however, we put them in a more solitary environment, they most likely would excel in academic studies, due to it being less stressful for them. Just imagine people running all about, bumping into and pushing others, when they normally can't even go up to the staff to ask for help. Having the choice of distance learning could take away that stress, and open a whole new road for them to go.

There are others that, unlike the people in the last paragraph, love socializing. They go out a lot, talk with their friends every day, and just love being around people, but there is just one problem; they absolutely loathe the school system and the way it sucks the life out of them. Well, if they tried distance learning, those students wouldn't have the troubles of the system lingering over them, and they could just get the work done. Sure, one would say that it takes away valuable social time, but if one thinks about it, it could also leave some free time to hang out with friends. Having that option, they wouldn't have to worry about whether or not they're precisely following the rules, if they're causing too much of a ruckus, or simply about what others might think of them.

Autonomy is a wonderful thing. It's nice to just relax and not feel like you have to go down a certain path. I do agree, though, that there needs to be some rules so people won't take advantage of everything. Distance learning is the very middle of those two extremes, understanding that one has the power to be anything they want as long as they work hard, while also knowing that there are still certain tasks they need to accomplish, and certain rules they need to abide by while doing said task. If we all let the small stars shine, they will shine brighter than any other.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6

Online schooling has become more and more possible as well as necessary with the growing rates of both children in need of schooling as well as the demand for better school conditions. Students would heavily benefit from the ability to use long distance learning programs because it would increase student attendance, improve the emotional well being of students, and reduce distractions that could prevent students from succeeding.

Students that are confined to their home due to a number of possible reasons, often miss out on important lesson taught while they are away. For example, students in Generic_City, China have been confined to their home due to the Corona virus outbreak. Instead of loosing that valuable learning time, many schools have switched over to a digital learning format. Students can now continue attending lessons regardless of their location or health. Although this current setting in Wuhan is temporary, the use of online learning programs may inspire officials to make a more permanent change. As another example, at Generic_School, teacher's often post materials that were used in daily lessons to an online service. This is so that students who were unable to attend are able to stay current with the missed material. Although this isn't direct online learning, students are able to use some of the beneficial properties of what online learning would provide. With online learning, attendance will no longer be a problem schools are forced to address.

Online learning would provide a more preferable environment for learning, which in turn, will reduce stress and improve general moral. For example, students residing in Generic_City are able to take online classes out of Generic_School. More importantly, their online classes often do not require in-person sessions, allowing students to complete assigned work at their own pace. Since there is no stress to complete work on a crunched time line, students can remain more stress free, and work at a pace more suited to their own learning pattern. In addition, students often prefer working at home, as they are surrounded in a more pleasing environment unlike typical school buildings that are often compared to prisons . While working at home, student can relieve stress by taking a break or grabbing a snack, actions that are substantially harder to do within a school. Not only that, but students who have family members or pets can spend time with them as well to relieve stress. Overall, online learning will remove stressful situations, and help students properly address their school related mental health.

Within a typical school, students often are forced to work through distractions created by those who are less courteous to those around them. Similar to how a single cricket in the night can keep someone awake, a single disruptive student can keep an entire class from being productive. A disruptive student can prevent others from completing their required work in the allotted time. With the implementation of online schooling, this entire problem could be avoided by removing the possibility of any disruptive students. Another common distraction within schools are the growing amounts of students with cellular devices. Cell phone have become of the most common distractions in schools. Although online learning will not remove the cell phone distraction, it will encourage students to understand time management once they realize that the more time they spend on their phones, the less time they will have to complete their work. With online schooling, distractions will become less prominent and allow the student to deal with their own distractions.

While the current schooling system does serve a purpose, it does have its flaws. Many of which can be solve with the implementation of long distance learning programs. With the higher demand of schooling to those unable to attend public schools, as well as those unfit to attend whether by physical location or health, online learning is becoming more and more of a necessity. Students would heavily benefit from long distance learning programs because it would increase student attendance, improve the emotional well being of students, and reduce distractions that could prevent students from succeeding.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
134BAA2D43CF,"The class online is a good then for students because it at home and it can be eays for the students to work on the class. In school it can be hired for some kids in the classrooms it can be claing for them like in fert of thr class things like at. But home schools or online class can be good in a way no people are alone no laged studnts.

Videos can help poeple that need to see exsples and if they look at it, play it and play it and take notes on what it is says in the video. One of the things that can be good by home schools is that you can have time to go outside or go to a store have fun at the same time. In schools you can not go to a store or someing in that way.

The way to get home because home school your in home so that is and in schools there bus that is it. So yes I feel like students have to learing sameing new says if a person is thing of be comeing home shools because I thing that is a little more freedome that they can have online school can be different in a way if it is the first time but it is haveing a good time. And all the problems in school you that in home that may not happing so that is one of the thing at can stop. if someone has online class say if work is not due a week you can have a long brak.

41A45843C231,"Part of our current edgucation system provides free chidcare to parents in adition to helping yonger students develope socially. This is why brick and morder schools will always be a necesity for elementery schoolers, but students outside that age range should have the opportunity to demonstrate their responcibility inorder to receive the privilage of being taught at home rather then at school because of social distractions, and the general time sink that is school .

All you ever hear about public schools today is bullying, exclusion, and drama that is pointless and distracts students from their academics, the solution is right infront of us, online school. Online school would be superior to traditional brick and morter school because students would have minimul opportunities to interact with one and other durring class which would make classroom control easier for the teacher. In adition to students having minimul opportunities to speak in class, everything that was said durring the class could be monitered by the teacher or by an automated program designed to detect any buzz words, unkind or curse words. The audomation could also keep count of the number of times students cursed or said rude things to eachother and report these infractions to the teacher. While this process might sound invasive, it isn't anything that teachers don't try to facilitate with physically, now they can do it technologically.

While the inclass conversations can definently be monitered, there is also out of class social media and txting that could be distracting during online class time, and with no physical adult in the room telling students to put away the phone how could we be sure that we aren't just trading one evil for another? While there are numerous distractions at home that could cause students grades to dip, the solution to this potential problem is that online school would need to be a privilage and not a right. Class time would need to be monitered.

Another benafit of monitered online school is that with less distractions the class could move faster which would allow extra time for students to persue recreational activities, and academic interests- this system would allow students to seperate their work time from their play time in a way that is just not possible today. This system of having extra time to dedicate to passions would also be benafitial in incentivising students to pay attention during class. This system also promotes better friendships by giving students time to persue interests outside of school-- providing an outlet to meet like minded people.

While online school isn't a perfect solution, it could change the way that manny students view school as a whole. Instead of being forced to sit in a building all day with other kids, we could be at home leaning on our own time with pre-recorded videos. With online schooling students get the opportunity to control their own edcation, and they are also incentivised to preform well, not because they are compeeting for spots at some perstegeous collage, but becuause they want their own free time.     ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
3F6E2E7E7734,"Teens that go to school from home always say it is a lot easier. They say you can go at your own pace and resume your lesson at any time you'd like! so, I agree with this argument. I believe students can definitely learn better with online classes. Think about it; students would have less distractions, they would be in their own comfortable environment, a lot more time would be given on assignments; `and it would decrease the stress levels in a high school and/or college student. Allow me to provide more reasons on why taking online classes is a lot easier.

Students who take online classes have a significantly lower chance of developing depression due to public school bullying or online bullying. Students also tend to hold a higher GPA score due to self pace that online classes provide. While some parents believe online classes is a great idea for their teen, other parents think differently. Parents also believe that taking online classes could greatly jeopardize their teen's mental growth. They fear their teen could be 'socially awkward' or wouldn't develop the proper structure a kid develops in public school, which is: learning how to sign a check, learning that things must be done by a certain time, learning the law, etc... all of these thoughts are fears that parents think of when they think of putting their teen on online classes when in reality, online classes teach the exact same thing!

So, in conclusion, I believe students should have some online classes. It would make things a lot easier in high school and/or college student's schedules and lives. It would also help them mentally. Schools should take these online classes into consideration because it could also help with school grade scales, overall class grades, and test scores. ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
F11D449380E6,"Sleeping in everyday, doing things on a flexible time frame, and even eating at any time of the day. Those attributes sound amazing. With an online school system that would be taken at home, these opportunities would be available. However, as this proposed education system appears miraculous, the reality is that this school system would instead take away more than give on the basic maturity characteristics needed for adulthood.

Hypothetically, if one were to do an online school system, they would have the ability to wake up any time they wanted. They could wake up at 8 AM, 10 AM, or most likely as students have a tendency to sleep in for large amount of hours, they could wake up around 1 PM, 2PM, so on and so forth. As students would be waking up late to start their day, they would missing breakfast, one of the most important meals of the day, along with that if, they wake up late, they will have a habit of then sleeping late and waking up at the same afternoon time, creating a cycle. Although, having a online system entails that students will be able to sleep in more, in truth, it is diminishing to their health as it creates unhealthy cycles and habits for eating times and sleeping times for students in the future. It might appear to be wonderful now, but in the future, students would have a multitude of regret.

As prompted, in online school, the assumption is that these students complete their tasks in a manner mostly by themselves as their study hours and subjects are catered to each and every specific student. However, again on the pretense of these students then having a flexible time frame as they can pace themselves, this also appears to be a stress-free schedule. However this does take away a lot more than it shows. It takes away social skills. Social skills that include team work, making new friends, creating personal connections with teachers, etc. These social skills are needed for adulthood, in an job environment, where it is required for interaction, for teamwork, and for the ability to communicate with an executive or a boss. With these students not being in person with one another and their own teachers, they would have no slight intonation on how to interact, but also in the right manner. Being physically present at school, enables these social characteristics and skills for each students, but with an online school, where every student is mostly at home trying to get their work done, by themselves, it does not enable those social skills, it demolishes it.

One of the biggest known issues in school systems, cheating, and now it would be a bigger issue in a online school system. As this is all done on an electronic device, is the assumption that tests would be taken on this device. It is easy for students to keep other tabs open to look up answers, or to use their siblings, friends, and parents to help them on these tests. Tests are in place to test each students specific knowledge on a topic, when their is answers given, the student's knowledge is not true to them, so it is immoral to cheat. By allowing an online school system, where it is easier for students to cheat and these students would have no issue doing it, as in today's world, grades have significantly become more important compared to the knowledge acquired. If an online school system were to be put in place, it could so very well encourage immoral actions and then negatively impact these students in the future as it has the possibility of becoming a habit.

An online school system where students can take their classes at home seems very beneficial to student. In the moment it may appear like that. Yet, in reality, an online school system would ruin a student's health, create a lack of social skills, and encourage immoral actions just to reach a goal. So in truth, an online school system is a viable option as if right now, but it's consequences are so much more negatively impactful and worse than it's beneficiaries. So students would not benefit from taking classes at home.                ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
25DE215F8B82,"The schools offer is option that the students to attend classes from home by of online or video conferencing, but i think to the students is not benefit. Sometimes to the students not learned and this can to affect to the student with his learning. The teacher can to make a video conferencing but they not know if the student to make all effort for learn.

The schools can offer is option but the teachers not know if the students is learning the same this option has benefit, but also not has benefit because for a students is important to take his classes in home but for others not the put importance to the studio. For example: The school to get me the option of study in home i know that not learned and for me is better to study in the school because in home not would put soul the studio.

The teaching for online or video conferencing not to be the same is in the school that in a video conferencing or online because everything to be different we in the school can to ask help to a companion when we not understand some and to be a big help have somebody that us help in thing that we not understand. We have classes in home to remove the benefit of to meet to other people and also in online or video conferencing not the to show as to make a exposition in public for example: In a few work we needing to pass to the front and explain the work, i think that the classes online will not teach us to not have pain talk in public but the school the teacher us to teach to pass to the front for that us to lose the fear and the pain.

A few students to say ""Is better study in the school because have more benefit and us help more for the future also us to learn much thing as be sociable, respectful and also be a big person."" The school has much thing that to us the help in the school a few students to take in serious his studio but always a few student that not take in serious his studio sometimes only to go to school to trouble. I know that a few students to prefer study in online but i know that not to be the same because only would be watch the computer.

My opinion that the better option is study in the school because have more opportunity for that us learn and in the school have more benefit for us life and the option for the students to attend classes from home not is good because to remove much oportunity of to meet a new people. Always is better study in the school have much thing and also the school to we us to distract beacuse so not think in us problems. In the school us effort for have a good future.            ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
C1A5212A7E96,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students would benefit from taking these classes because they can work at their own pace, they can be in a safer environment, and they have less stress.

Online classes let students work at their own pace. In school, many classes are extremely fast paced. Students do not have time to finish all the work the teacher assigns. With online classes, students are able to work at a much slower pace. This is beneficial to the students because they are not stressed about keeping up with the class. On the other hand, there are some classes that may be too slow for students. These students are restricted by the speed of the class therefore, the online classes would be perfect for them to work at a faster pace. The online classes benefit all students.

Students feel safer at their house, rather than at school. Unfortunately, the threat of school shootings makes schools an even less safer environment. Since taking an online class is from home, this would make the student feel safer and would benefit the students. Also, sicknesses and diseases can spread easily in schools. Students do not want to get sick, they want to learn. This is why online classes would be perfect because then they would not have to risk getting sick at school. They could stay home away from risk of disease and continue the learning process.

So many students become stressed from school. At school, students have to worry about important tests and quizzes, homework, and fitting. On top of that, they worry about things that are out of their control like school shootings, fires, and sicknesses spreading. The online classes would solve all of these problems because the student can stay home and work from there. Since the online classes take away these stresses, it is beneficial for students to take online classes from home.

Some people may think that taking online classes from home is not beneficial to students; However, since online classes allow students to work at their own pace, be in a safer environment, and have less stress, online classes are beneficial to the students in many ways.    ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
0AC49CE1A516,"Imagine it, sitting at home in your pajamas getting ready to take a test for high school, and it sounds to good to be true. Many schools do offer programs like this so they can open up space in classes for other students. These programs have shown improvement in student mental health as well as scores. Students who take classes at home would benefit students because it would improve overall grades in certain classes, help students with more family responsibility get an education, and students don't need to worry about the stress of the classroom.

Certain classes don't require as much guidance from the teacher as others, and that is just the reality of it. Classes such as math and sciences require students just to know how to work a problem, and that can be taught with a book or a video. So with more of the more technical classes being at home grades will improve because of the more time dedicated to learning a concept at home instead of a more limited time in the classroom. Also if you do have a question for the course at home technology today allows us to instantly communicate an issue to our teachers. Overall students in this environment can gain a lot out of working out problems at home.

Some students have missed school some days or even dropout because of responsibilities at home. Online classes provides them means to be able to get an education and better improve their lives. This allows opportunities for higher education or even a shot at a job. Online classes give the time needed for students that have more responsibilities to learn key concepts in classes. These students have the work ethic to be great students,but lack the time to work on school. However because of online classes they can work and excel at it.

The stress and anxiety of the classroom creates an setting that makes students not get the help required to learn the material, but with digital courses the more stressed students can learn the concepts. Students put pressure on other students to move along with a lesson especially when no other students are confused; this leaves some students behind in courses. Also for the few students that do fall behind are affect the whole year due to missing one key concept at the beginning of the year. This can be solved with online classrooms because it is a much more one on one learning experience, and allows students to grasp the main ideas. Students who suffer from stress and anxiety can have an equal opportunities as the more confident students.

In conclusion,students overall who have difficulty due to time, mental health,and just plain boredom can have an equal shot at an education as other students. Online classes are the path to success for students that have to take care of younger siblings or work to support their families. Also they give students who don't need to much help in a class to have more flexibility in a class. Finally students who suffer from anxiety are given a chance to really learn a concept,and not fall behind their piers. The idea of an online classroom will be the future of the education system in not only Virginia, but The whole United States.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
1EB21F75AB8A,"As a society, it has become normal for kids to follow the same path every weekday that leads them firstly to school, and then back to home. Some schools are beginning to offer distance learning from home as an alternative to attending a physical school. This is unnecessary and could potentially be detrimental to students whom benefit from the physicality of school as it is now and could lead to unwanted effects. Schools should remain physical for many reasons, primary examples of why would likely be due to the organization that provides currently, and secondly because of the complications that online schooling creates.

Adapting to a new school system would be at the very minimum very dysfunctional to many students who have revolved their schedules around the physicality of current schooling. Both student and parent schedules have been built around what times they go to school and for many parents, a change to online school would provide struggle to return home everyday simply to tediously drive their children to their respective extracurricular activities they may have left after the shift to online school. A continuation of the current schooling method maintains this careful balance of how the students manage to attend their after-school events. This is also beneficial to parents whose work schedule may conflict with the schedule an online school would provide and for something as delicate as work hours, could mean having to face unemployment at the cost of switching schooling methods. Shifting an entire school's enrollment onto online school would also provide many students who already have difficulty with technological learning further stress and struggle.

Online school while in the end might be more fluid and simplistic than the current method of schooling, but online school would not be adapted without complication. The amount of children who already struggle with online testing and assignments is astronomically higher than the amount that struggle with physical paperwork and a shift to online school would only exacerbate that number. Online schooling creates complications that a normal school does not as for some children in lesser-fortunate areas, internet access isn't always an ability. Children plagued with unfortunate financial situations may not be able to pay the taxing amounts of money that internet companies demand in this technological age. This leads to some children being unfairly disadvantaged and prevented from holding the same opportunities as those with the ability to video call a private teacher. Online school creates a different learning environment, one which children of this current era, and parents of the eras prior, are both unequipped and unprepared for and would create adversity in finding the same strategies that were physically capable in modern school systems.

Online Schooling, while it may be beneficial to students with physical limitation or who need one-on-one assistance, would be nothing shy of disruptive, disorganized, and complicating to the systems currently in place. This being said, children should be equally able to attend schooling regardless of what form and for solely that reason, in necessity, Online school should be provided externally and not as a form of public education. Adopting a new method of schooling is non-assisting and should remain as an emergency protocol in wake of the impossibility of physical schools. Physical schools will be capable of providing schooling for generations to come and should remain as the primary method of public education.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D06917E7E152,"Many students hate school and wish they could take online school. For many students school is a dreadful, terrible place where everyday bullies and bad teachers hinder their ability to learn and receive good grades. For most, online school can very easily fix those problems. Although some people believe online school is bad for academics because it creates a learning environment where cheating is very easy, Online school is better for learning because students can work at their own pace, students do not have to deal with the social aspects of physically being in school, and students can receive extra help if they need it

To begin, many students in school are left behind not understanding the material because they learn different than their teachers teach. This causes problems with their ability to learn. Sometimes teachers go too fast and while some students may be able to learn fast, others are not able to. If students have access to online school they will be able to work at their own pace and be able to retain the information better. In real school many classes are one to two hours long, in that amount of time multiple assignments are given which are due at the end of the class. Some students are not able to work that fast and fall behind because all of the work they have not finished during class time becomes homework on top of what they already have. When students have too much homework it causes stress and anxiety. if online school was available students could work as long as they want on assignments because there would not be a set time that a certain class is over. Online school make learning easier, and less stressful.

In addition, the many social aspects can also create large amounts of stress for students. Many students wake up every morning and dread going to school because of bullies or social anxiety. The many social aspects in school can make focusing on learning very difficult. Some students cannot even be in a cafeteria with 100 people without having a panic attack and completely shutting down. Online school can fix these problems because students would be able to work from the comfort of their own home. Being able to work from home takes away all of the anxiety and bullies. School emergencies are also a large problem for many students because worry can distract from learning. Everyday students go to school scared that they will make make it out alive because of school shootings and other dangerous things that can happen at school. Online school would calm the nerves of these students and let them focus on learning and not have to worry about their life or having a panic attack in the cafeteria.

To continue, some students need extra help from teachers because some subjects are harder for some students. With online school students could work anytime they want to because many online schools offer 24 hour teacher help just by video conference or online chat. This help can greatly impact the learning environment by making sure no student is ever left behind because help is always available when they need it. Online school could also help with children that work, like child actors or kids that have to work to provide for their families. Some families income is not high enough and the children must work in order to just eat. When students are faced with this many of them drop out in order to protect and provide for their family. Online school can help them because it creates school with a very flexible schedule so they can work anytime they need to.

Finally, Online school can greatly benefit students because they will not have to deal with teachers going too fast, the social aspects of school, or needing extra help and not being able to receive it. If students are forced into staying in physical schools with bullies and bad teachers around every corner, their grades will drop and they will not be able to perform well in school. Every school district needs to make online school an option for all students. If school districts do not allow on line school everyone should write to the superintendent and tell them online school is a great need in their district because online school makes learning easier and less stressful for everyone.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
FE0F75B1CFFD,"The school have to opion the student is benefit to being able to attend classes fro home ,some school should not requite to attend classes online because the student not study in home, don't put more attention the online class your degree not tube high if not interest for your class online, but some time the all school think about how you take better in the school not at the home, we thinking about to take class online. when the people think the school give more work is for that want to maybe pass the class or graduate in your school, but all school help the student for pass all class they don't care how to pass. Some time the school benefit the student have class online because the teacher not more to be stay after school or maybe de programs help more the student is like more intereste when riceved class online or maybe they concentration more but in the program the my school to much student don't like the class online because not have teacher to explain the class or the work they need better to look the person to real for ask the question at have the problem for homework.

The stduent not study in home because you have more distration not focues in your class online or maybe forgert the start at the time when you have the class online,for example you need to start at the home 11:30 Am, but you not these in your home; because your play maybe in home the other friends, or maybe these in the beach therebyor maybe in the city or park do not have internet. Some school don't like to take class in home, but your counselor help how to pass when you go to tha vacation she help you how to keep work or homework is good idea sometime the student not improved when the teacher or conslur give your class online is like not interesting because you feel exaitde is your vacation. For example in holiday the family stay all in house if they have party you not concentration in your room or your house because your cousion or your friends plays you need to stay which they but only have thist time for play is you have class online you nor play which your family you need saty in your class. Is not to benefit is more better pass all class and not have to more online class .

when you have class online your degree need stay hihg in your attend,work and good degree because all count, for example when my friends Generic_Name not these in video conferencing in class the economic only one day the degree is loss domw only one day that she say omg i need saty at time in this class; I need do homework all days is as resposibility when you have class only. In my opion the take the class only, is not the good idea nothing for nothing put atention and also nothing that resposibility; when have class is like the people don'tcare the class is loss the time is not the good idea. Or maybe when you have video conferencing, the class you put more nervous because the teacher ask the question is you not how to answer you dont like enymore to take class online ,but only stay you and the teacher in one part is very nice but only is audio you need your breain more relax atac the class.

.

Another reason is how your plane tube better in the school not the home or maybe if you need more time satay in the school is more perfect study, your teacher have more example for you maybe you concentration more tha your home is like as good idea, if you think you take time you concentration more, in your school if you have teacher for your explame, your reason is your degree is more better, the one reson is you need to pass this class you don't need take one more time is more better to have time for pass this class that you need to take again one year more,for example If you want to graduation in this year, but you need to take online class or video conferencing but you not want to stay at the home at the time because your work or your games,I don't we have to pass this class if you think you not to resposibility is more better to take one year more that your loos your time if not interesting for the class .

In my conclusion the all school need to pass the class online or video conferencing but someone student dont care how pass class or how to take another class maybe for your graduation or maybe for your futrure is more importan or maybe your attend, is good when you decisde to go to the college, you need in your essay to put to attend is like explain your life in your school. but the school should not be requier, to take class online is not good idea the student not study in your home, not interest the class, and student need to be good degree for pass the class. for example when I decide to go to the college Generic_Name she is the careercenter in Generic_School she tellme first your attend is good, your take class online your pass class she askeme all the question why?

when you initial your application you need to put good record, if when you think omg my record not good or maybe good if when I say neede to pass but is to much late only for not pass the class only. in my opinon to take class only is not good idea not body to explain your work more you need think your lonely. To pass class online is importan not only for pass is for when your college or univercity is you want you have class online maybe is good aidea but when stay in Hihg School os not good idea yoiu have time you have all and have more preparated for your class our your deplom.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
22D938F5E0E2,"Many Public and private schools have advanced in many ways throughout the past decade. Schools all around the world have weaved technology advancements into the classroom and outside of the class room to help get students more actively involved in school related activities and lessons. Technology is a blessing and curse, which means it helps teachers teach but also in certain aspects it worsens the attention span of younger children. Diving deeper into this world-wide technology advancement that is happening, there is this one main question that gets asked quite a lot by administrators all around the world, ""Would students work harder and better if they could attend classes from home virtually online or through video conferencing?"" My full opinion to that is, no. Studies show that almost 97% of people work better in a room full of other peers, although the isolation and focus you may have at your own home is nice and relaxing, in order for a person to fully develop into a knowledgeable student they have to have, social skills, community awareness, and be able to understand eye-to-eye learning. You can truly only achieve these three skills if you attend school physically, not virtually, that is why students would not benefit at all through at home learning than they would at school.

In order for all students to successfully climb up the social ladder, they need to have one major trait that can help all peers make connections, bonds, and even relationships, this skill is called social skills. There was a study done at Workman State College where scientist studied students who stayed home for the whole school day and then studied students who actually went to school for the whole day. Both groups of students were learning the same material, the group at home got a video of their teacher explaining everything exactly the same as what she taught in class. Half of students at home did not talk to a single person the whole day that they were at home, meanwhile, the students at school had many conversations with other peers and teachers. Throughout the day, the students who stayed at home lost 10% of there overall social communication skills and did worse on a pop quiz about the information that was being taught by their teacher. This study exemplifies that if you were to stay at home and miss even just one day of school you would miss out on many social lessons like peer project and even just normal conversations that are experiences that can strengthen you socially for the future.

While being at school you do not just learn about how to solve for 'x' in mathematics or who won the Mexican-American War, students subconsciously grow and learn more about their community throughout grade school. There is this whole other community aspect of learning going on that most do not even notice. What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness.

Going to school everyday and seeing you teachers and classmates is a prime and simple example of eye-to-eye learning. Eye-to-eye learning is basically being with another person in real life, not over a screen, and actually talking and learning form them. Almost every kid remembers at least one first day of school memory when they were little or even this past year. Well, that connection you made with other students and your teacher was an official eye-to-eye connection made. Unlike looking at a screen four hours on end while being taught, having the physical opportunity to talk to your teacher either in a whole class discussion or one-on-one is much more effective than an email or text message. There was a study done by the Freelance College in North Dakota, many certified scientist studied the difference between learning through videos on a screen at home or being at school learning through a teacher. Both groups were taught the same thing and took a ten question test on the lesson that the teacher had taught. The statistics showed that students who stayed at home had a test average of 75%, while students who went to school had a test average of 97% The students who worked on the computer at home had a shorter attention span because their teacher was physically not at their house teaching them, thus caused the at home students to do poorly on the test. Overall, this study clearly shows that students learn exceptionally better with eye-to-eye discussion in real life at school. Being able to communicate with a teacher one-on-one or in a class discussion really makes a positive change in the students academic performance.

Although being at home is a quiet place to focus, in order for a student to fully develop into a successful person you have to have, social skills, community awareness, and be able to understand eye-to-eye learning. The way successors achieve these three skills easily is if you attend actual classes and school related events, students would not benefit anymore at home through virtual learning anymore than they do at school. Even though there are so many technology advancements, schools world-wide need to realize that many staying simple is better and that students must always attend classes in person in order to achieve greatness in the future      ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
FEE59DA64E91,"Fighting, drama, bullies, and irritated teachers are all factors of attending public school. We live in a society where social anxiety and depression are now a common problem. Everyday, somewhere in the world, a child is diagnosed with anxiety. Attending a public school can worsen the symptoms of the mental illness. Anxiety can have major effects on your body including; panic attacks, depressive spells, anger outburst, crying episodes, and nausea. Drama and fighting can be an easy trigger for a student with the mental illness, and for an unknown reason, public schools have a lot of drama. Most drama comes from bullying, the popular girls give the smart girls a hard time. The typical teenage ""movie"". Bullying is a serious matter, we lose at least 10 children a day due to bullying. When someone is mean to you over and over again, you begin to believe that it is your fault, which can cause negative thoughts in a young persons mind. The suicide rate in the past 20 years is higher than ever. Most of the recorded suicides have to deal with bullying. Doing classes from home sounds like a positive way to keep physical bullying at a minimum.

I understand waking up early, not getting enough sleep, didnt get a chance to have your morning coffee, or even you're still a little bit sleepy can have a negative effect on ones attitude. I believe teachers suffer with this reality more than the students. Their day can begin as early as 5 am!

School usually starts around 7am-8am, and when students arrive, some carry mean and ugly attitudes with them. The often take out stress or anger from other things on teachers who are already not having the best of days. In return, if being sent to the office isn't occurring, teachers will scream and fuss at the class causing a chain reaction of bad energy.

Doing online classes doesn't sound half as bad when you hear you get to go to school in your pj's. I remember having ""spirit week"" at school, and we would have special day where we did different things. My favorite day was always ""Pajama Day"". Remaining comfy and calm can relieve stress from a student, which is why school from home sounds like a pretty good idea. In school, there are more than just you in the building, which means moving at your own pace isn't really an option. Students get extremely irritated when they feel like they are being rushed in or out of a subject, which can cause a lot of hostility or sadness. I believe this can take a lot of the stress school applies away.

I do understand that with doing school from the comfort of your own home comes with some cons as well, such as shielding children from a reality they soon will face. I am also aware that not all children have such access to these things such as; WiFi, a laptop, school supplies at home, or a good support system at home. I do believe that the ""one-on-one"" time a child will receive is extremely beneficial. The student will not have to worry about being left behind or being confused. They will have the time to understand while working at their own pace. Allowing the student to have a peace of mind, not worrying or struggling in school.

In conclusion, the whole idea of school from home has both positive and negative outcomes. I believe it will help decrease the anxiety rate, and suicide rates of younger adults. I also believe it will help the graduation rate rise higher than ever. Students and teachers will have more time with family, friends, and themselves. Following the decision of home school, the time it takes the average student to complete school could be changed. Instead of the 12 year average it could be shortened due to the pace students work at with one on one education. The system definitely will have a better success rate with the homeschooling idea at hand.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
BDE08546F7EE,"Having Online Classes show positive and negative results in a student. Online Classes are like regular classes, that teaches you the S

tandards of Learning . Like every other class, students listen to what the teacher has to say and answer questions on that objective, of what the teacher taught them.

Students that take online classes do have its benefits. For example, if you don't have enough credits, counselors tell students that are going to graduate if they do or do not have enough credits, they can take online classes. As long as you sign up with the school your attending, complete the course and earn the credit; they're able to graduate. Another reason are Programs, if you're in a high school program, you might have to take an ""Exit-Test"" exam. An example of that is C.I.S.L. (Center of Intelligence Studies of Languages), throughout high school you learn a new language, besides English, at the end of junior or senior year, and you'd take this exam to see how much you learn by taking an reading, writing, speaking, and listening test. Another example is College, some young adults can't afford to leave home or to busy taking care of their family, to even see a sight of college in their future. That's why Online Colleges were made, to help those who can't help themselves nor have the money of affording a tuition. College online classes, are the same as high school you listen to a professor on a matter subject and take a quiz or test, from what you learned from them. Another reason Online classes are beneficial they're different schedule classes. For example you have to work 11:30 A.M. through 8:30 P.M. Then you can schedule a class for 10:00 P.M. You can pick your time of the day class. Different from being in a real school, you have to be at that class at a certain time and day, or you're marked absent or tardy.

But there are also some consequences in Online Classes; online classes, are actually classes and real professors grade you on your work, so if your slacking or getting real low quiz and test scores, you've failed the class, and you don't get any credit from that class. Then you have to redo the whole course, because with no credit you can not graduate. Another reason Online classes have negative results, is that they have the rights to kick you out the class, in the beginning of the course, they're suppose to give you an agreement and term contract, and if your attendance is poor, they'll kick you out the class.

However, I believe that online classes are very beneficial for students. To take classes from home or from school, doesnt really matter, as long as you get the class credit and complete your recommencement, you can graduate.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
A6B037934481,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I say yes and no. I say yes because some people get home sick just from being away from home too long. For some students its a better learning process and some students get distracted in class easily. I also say no because some rather prefer learning it in person than from a distance. My personal opinion is that I think its so much better for a teacher to explain and actually show you what to do in person rather than online.

Most students take there classes online because some of them can't concentrate in class or they easily get distracted. I can most certainly say I get distracted in class because for one I love to talk, but I also get my work done because I know how to muti-task. But some students cant do that. I never really considered taking online classes because I cant just learn off what a electronic tells me. I prefer to be in class and listen and hear from a teachers point of view.

I think its way better to actually be in class and hearing it from a teacher because the teacher can help you understand your work more. Plus, if your struggling or don't understand what your doing then teachers have study hall and after school hours so students can come and get the extra help they need. My teacher Generic_Name is always asking my class do we understand it or do we need help. Therefore if we still don't understand what was being taught in class, she'll stay after school just so she can help us out and help us understand it more.

Online classes is not bad because it helps students be more comfortable at home rather than at a school. Most students don't attend college because of the distance. Mostly because they dont know anybody and so they rather be in an environment where they know people. I believe thats why they created online classes because most students dont feel comfortable being at school where they dont know anybody.

Finally, my answer to this questions is no, because theres no way you can understand your work more on a computer rather than actually hearing it come from a teacher unless you really focus and pay attention. Most teachers prefer students to take online classes to graduate and finish all your classes early. But I rather take my time and actually learn and understand more.",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
2704E9C5DD78,"Which is the best place for education, in a school or online? In the modern world, many schools offer students the ability to attend classes that can be done online or by a video conference; an idea called ""distant learning."" However, while an intriguing idea, some people will ask whether or not students would actually benefit from doing schoolwork outside of school. Due to its unique advantages, distant learning can offer benefits for students because it is more convenient for students and it has more tools available to make learning easier.

While some will say distant learning has its advantages, others will be quick to point out the disadvantages as well. One such disadvantage is if students take classes online, they can easily get distracted by something else. It would be relatively easy for a student, especially teenagers or preteens, to move away from their classwork and go to websites or games that are not related to education and completely disregard their schoolwork. This will inevitably cause students to fall behind on doing their work or do poorly on the work. As a result, the student may end up failing the class. While there are more reasons why online classes do not work as well as regular ones, the greatest reason distant learning would not benefit students is the potential distractions students may face while doing it.

On the contrary, distant learning does have its benefits for students who want to succeed. One of distant learning's benefits is its overall convenience. Many students will say that trying to catch the bus, walking to, or even driving to school is a tedious task to complete just so they can learn something. Adding to their concerns, problems can occur for students as they try to get to school; such as a car accident, bus breaking down, poor weather conditions, and even traffic in some cases. Distant learning enables students to stay home and just log into their classes via a computer, a lesser amount of work to do in the morning. Staying home also means students have less problems to worry about when it comes to attending their classes. Making classes more convenient for students to access is a great way distant learning benefits education.

Another benefit distant learning has is its connection to the Internet, which has plenty of tools students can use. In a regular classroom, students have two things to rely on for their education: the teacher giving lectures and textbooks to read from. Those things are reliable, but it may be too difficult for some students to understand or stay with their teachers. If students use the Internet, they have access to websites, educational activities, videos, and many other tools that provide accurate information and help a student gain better understanding of the material at hand. The activities may even be fun for students to accomplish while obtaining knowledge. The tools provided by distant learning is yet another benefit for students wishing to participate in them.

Despite its clear disadvantages, distant learning can benefit a student's education thanks to its convenience and access to educational tools. It can be considered a good first step in making education much easier for students not just in the United States, but all over the world. Distant learning is definitely a beneficial way for students to get their education in the distant future. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4CAB27E45729,"Offering distance learning as an optoion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a good idea for the students. Some students for distance sometimes can be an issue, as for others they can't go to school for there health issues, and for others it would still be teacher to student/s.

Transportation can be dificult with that issue, and something that issue effects going to school. The car can break down, the tire car wheel can pop, something can just stop working making the car act up. making the distance to school seem longer then it should, and it being unsafe to drive at times. Better to stay safe then sorry. Sometimes you could be a whole city way, or state away dealing with family issues. School work would be one thing less on you're shoulders for your problems.

Then there is the issue of being sick. With this, sick poeple would be able to stay home and not spread their grems and get others sick. Maybe you're having a medical issue where you could be at the hospital,this way you could be in 2 places at once. you would be in the hosppital bed learnign about math while the rest of your class is at school learning about the same thing. At home on bed rest? You could easily hope on to the website they have, and you could be learning at the same time as them about the topic.

Some students need, that one on one with a teacher to learn somethings. with being online or video conferencing those students then have that one on one with the teachers. Some of those students are the right then and there or never again type of students. Where if they don't ask then and there they won't remember what the y want to ask or what they were going to say. Then others would just like to see their favorite teacher to left there hopes being sick or to far from home.

With all of this, giving students the option to go online to get there schooling while sick helps. Or when they may need help with something so they do video conferencing so they may understand directly what the teacher is trying to get to. so even with trouble with distance, or the health issues you may have. And for some, just the speaking to others help. These are some reasons that benefit from being able to attend classes from home. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
BB8064D7B327,"My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she could'nt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and it's easier and quicker.

The primary reason on why it's a good benefit, it's that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think you're wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled.

Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy.

Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. it's non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". In conclusion, it's less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing!

Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but it's a one on one class. There's no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think it's a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0
EBDBA726D479,"Would you learn better by taking online classes at home? Many children are home schooled for different reasons and take online classes to complete their education. Yet, most students perfer to attend school to accomplish and to better understand their education coming from a real teacher. Students would benefit better from attending school in a building enviroment because students are able to communicate with each other, better access to educational resources, and a understanding of subjects by attending classes.

When going to school, you are able to socialize with friends and fellow classmates to better your education. Many students benefit from communicating with other students because they can help each other out with assignments. For example, I was in history class and when we were given an group assignment to complete by the following week. I decided to partner up with one of my classmates and we used our knowledge to get the work done. By working hard, plus rationalizing our work we were able to finish the assignment a day early. By working together, we were able to use our heads to pass the assignments with flying colors. Having the chance to socialize with other students help create a better educational enviroment for the students. This results in better grades and student involvement during school hours.

Some assignments can be hard to complete by yourself without any help. When taking online classes, you have no access to teacher references or input. For instance, I was having trouble with a math assignment and I couldn't figure out what to do. I tried using the internet, notes from my class, and textbooks from school; yet, they still didn't help me how to figure out the assignment. I asked my teacher one morning, before the assignment was due, to help me understand the work properly. She guided me through every problem and answered my question of uncertainty. By math class, I turned in the assignment complete and my grade came back with a perfect score. When attending school, teachers are there to help you at any time. They are resources that you can't get from anywhere else. By using them as resources, you are highly to get a good grade and understand the information more efficiently.

By attending school, you enter class with a teacher in the room explaining the lesson. While the teacher is teaching; she gives you tools on how to understand the material properly. Thus, the teacher is giving you tips and tricks to have the information and on how to use that information wisely. For example, I was in math class and we were about to learn a new lesson. During the lesson, the teacher gave many short cuts and tricks on how to understand the material more effectively. After the lesson, she gave us worksheets to practice some problems to understand the information. I used the tricks she showed us and was able to do the exercises without a problem. When going to school, you are exposed to new material in a classroom. By being exposed to this new material, you are able to understand the information being given better with the tips and tricks the teacher is showing you.

Does attending school help you better benefit you in your education? Many students attend school because they want a good education. They want a good foundation to help them prepare themselves for the future. Having the exposure to an educational enviroment helps them get the tools they need to support themselves in real life. Thus, giving students a benefit to secure a good profession and be ready for independent life. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
917F50B27723,"Learning is a priority in everyone's life.

We spend our entire childhood learning all types of subjects that will better us in the future.

Depending were you attend school the requirements are different.

Throughout the United States we have several methods in order to learn our core subjects such as: public school, private school, and home school.

Also some schools are offering distant learning were the student stays home and attends the class online or video chat.

With many beneficial learning methods everyone is different and may need a unique way to learn.

Is it beneficial for students to take classes at home?

When attending a public school there are many challenges that we will come across.

One major challenge we are confronted with is the lack of social skills.

Public schools do have an increased amount of students that make the classes larger.

While the classes are larger it may be hard to hear an instructor and difficult for the instructor to teach.

With the bigger the school the more activities they do and opportunities to make friends.

It may be hard but there is a need for social skills and you will learn them best at a public school. Also may be hard to ask instructor questions with a large class.

A private school has a decreased amount of students in the classes.

With the reduced classes it may be easier for the instructor to take time with an individual if they are struggling in their work.

Although a private school comes at a cost, its not very cheap to attend.

There are fees, annual payments, lunches, field trips, and anything extra the student may want to do such as: soccer, cheer, football, and clubs.

However, being apart of the school but taking classes at home can be very different it can be more sustainable for some students.

This can be for students who have medical issues that cant leave home or the hospital and still attend there school without falling behind.

Also for students who dont have transportation or even have work during the day this opportunity can help them out no matter the situation.

Students can still learn from home and have nobody interrupt the class and if the student needs assistance they can video chat the teacher or aid on the class.

In conclusion, students taking the offered distant learning would be beneficial because there are less distractions and a better environment for the student.

Its better for a student to be in an environment that they are comfortable instead of nervous and rushed because they may not do their work to the best that they can.

It may not be for every student but it can be for some.

This method of learning can help so many students who rather be at home instead of being in a desk, at school, and in a classroom.          ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
B41900D2BB5B,"Online School is the New Cool

You wake up, it is pitch black outside and there's no sound of life on the earth. No birds chirping, or people laughing. The day doesn't even seem to have begun. Incredibly tired from the night before, you rush out of bed to brush your teeth and hair, throw on some clothes, shove a pop tart in your mouth, and get in the car. Oh what a disastrous morning it is for that of a public school student. The switch to online classes is not only beneficial for the mental health of students, it also provides them with a better education, and a comfortable learning environment.

We all know what it's like to feel upset about ourselves. To have a bad feeling about our appearance, whether that be our clothes or our body. Imagine being reminded of that every day in a school setting. Students are constantly told by their peers that they are not good enough. When I started middle school was when this feeling set in. My mental health rapidly declined and I started not caring about the way I acted towards my family because all I wanted was to be good enough in the eyes of my classmates. Once I realized this wasn't healthy, I asked my parents if I could take classes online. I truly believe it is best for the mental and emotional health of our youth. Online schooling creates an environment where students can't be judged, harassed, or bullied. Also, it provides a chance for students to rest their brains when they want to, not when the teacher says they can. Taking classes online is the best way to improve the mental health of our youth.

A better education is provided when taking online classes. Some may say getting assistance for an online class is easier than getting it in the classroom. When students are being taught in a classroom full of other kids, they are constantly fighting for the attention of the teacher and most of the time, not getting the clarity they need. I am taking an online English class and I have found that by emailing my teacher if I need help, I can better understand the instructions because the emailed instructions are written to me and not to a classroom full of peers. Because I can get clarity, I am then able to do better and work faster. I am also allowed to reread instructions whereas verbal instructions can be harder to understand in the moment. Allowing online emailing or even video conferencing, creates an environment where students are comfortable asking their questions, and this ultimately provides for a better education.

The learning environment associated with online school and/or class is the best part of the experience. Students can sleep in and rest when they want to. They can have a peaceful morning which translates to a more productive day. School is a distracting place filled with drama, fighting, and distractions. Taking classes from home allows students to stay focused and get more work accomplished. Online schooling doesn't have to be done only at home, many students enjoy going to the bookstore, or a coffee shop. This is a great way to interact with other people and be productive. A comfortable learning environment is critical to build a successful school career.

Some may say that online schooling causes teens to become antisocial, lonely, and depressed. This is not warranted because the effect is the opposite. Working from home allows students to take the time they need to get work done for the day in their own time, and then spend the remainder with friends or doing other activities. Students actually have more free time because they aren't as distracted. As long as they are participating in plenty of activities, and are getting out in the world to talk with others, teens will not become antisocial, lonely or depressed.

Being able to learn from a distance is tremendously beneficial to our youth. The classroom is not a good environment for students to build a successful career. In schook, their mental health declines, they don't get their best education possible, and they dont have a comfortable learning environment. The switch to online classes is something all students, schools, and parents should be encouraging. ",6,Distance learning,Independent,1.0

but when you in the group your work is more ease for you because you have other peoples and thye help you in thing a goods ideas and they can make a good work if you work only you need more time for doing you work and some times we can chese a good things and some times we need others opinions the other peoples.

My opinin in this statemnt is, i agree because some times the classes in oline make ease and is a good oportuinite for some students for graduateand they can have a job, because some studen live alone and they need pay some bills then when take a classes online they have time for work and your life is more confortable, but this oportunities some times have a problems because some people not have a the same beneficts and this people need other thins like others helps and i thing school need other things not onle classes online or classes in the home because they dont know how is the life te other peoples ans when school have a this thins like classes oline and classes in te home they need put estrited rulers for students they make a shure when students take a classes and they need have a god teachers and good ideas for students take a classes and not have preblems when they need graduate, because sometimes students have a problemes for graduate and that not is good.

I have other opinion for the classes take in the home this classes not is for all students because some studen like your age is 12 in 15 they need take a classes in the school they dont need job because they can work for you age and this students they need go school for learning more specific thing and practice more in the class taht reason is because some times some guys not want to go school and they skip the classes and school if the school not have a good control for this and this stundents need more motivation and more enfoques in the life, this guys need classes in the home some times when parents is estricted they can change and they dont doing any more time bad chose.

All school have make a sure this oportunities is better for students for examples they know if students feeld good in home and the relation whit family is better some people when tehy have a problems they cant enfoques in you school and this is a problem when you need graduate if you take a classes in the school and you have this problems you can talk whit other people like teacher or your friends but if you have a this problems and you take rthe classes in the home you cant talk whit other people for solve your problems. that why i say you need go to school when you have the oportuinite because the school is better bescase we need learn something the others people and we make a good personalite for future and chose a good ideas for my life.                                     ",3,Distance learning,Independent,0.4
1FF56BEDD938,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing . Students from all around the world would be able to attend school from their houses or wherever they are at for the time being . They would be able to join classes at anytime of the day so , its basically like making their own schedule .Opponents incorrectly think that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because, these students would procrastinate more and its easier to cheat from home than in school . Although some believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes online it should be known that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home .

One reason that students would benefit from attending classes from home is that many students can not afford to go to school . For example:not having enough money for books and clothes but , from home you can user online books like e-books and such . and the clothes wouldnt be a problem nobody knows what you wear at hone home . The professor or teacher can make a recording of the lesson to students who arent able to be in the class . In addition, this change in school can also decrease the chance of bullies . For instance, many students get bullied for appearance and could be targeted by bullies, if these said students start attending school from home the bullies would no longer have anybody to pick on . Also there could be a decrease in teenage deaths due to suicide .

Lastly, this change could prevent the most common cold . Colds are often caused by interactions with other people if nobody is in school , there is a least likely chance of becoming sick . For example , sharing things such as : food , pencils , and other things can cause colds because of germs and not everybody is clean.

Additionally , having students attend school from home is much safer and easier, by having students work by they selves they are learning how to be self dependent and learn responsibility .This concept is teaching young adults how to live in the real world . For example, learning time management is a big key to responabilty and students can not procrastinate on whats important like a paper thats due at the end of the week . Students have to learn how to plan ahead so, that they do not fall behind . Also, these students can get a head start if they do work from home . for example if you are a stay at home single teen mom you no longer have to pay for childcare. Other way students benefit from this new program is that they can make their own schedules on when to do school work. Some students might work better at night so they do all their other errands during the day and school work at night , many students are the other way around .

Even though some many believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home , it should be know that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home . Opponents wrongly think that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because , not everybody has access to an online computer or laptop and might not be able to learn specifically one on one . Students would be able to benefit from attending classes from home because , different people from around the world can , it prevents bullies , and also prevents colds. Additionally students would benefit from attending classes from home because they learn time management plus responabilty , can make their own schedule and can get a head start into the real world, and learn to be self dependent . As a result this plan should be permitted to all schools , everywhere as a reason for students to do better and learn more , not only for them but others as well . ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
0309F61A6F1A,"I struggle in math a lot because of the mass amount of information I'm being presented with, but when I had a chance to work with a teacher on a 1 to 1 enviorment, I felt that I could ask any question without having that anxiety of thinking if I'm asking too many questions, or if I'm being judged by my classmates for the type of questions I'm asking. I believe having the option to learn from home can be a very useful option for some students because some students can learn better by having a teacher to answer any questions by the individual and only the individual, and because some students have medical, social, or even physical problems.

It's easier to focus in an enviorment when the teacher's point of focus is on you and no other student. There's an incentive that makes you have to pay attention, unlike where in a classroom it can very loud and distracting. With that insentive to pay attention, you would be more motivated to ask more questions, have more time to focus on what you're struggling on, and not be distracted or held back by other students. Having no distractions while simoltaniously having a teacher ready to help you at any time does change a student's mentallity on how to work.

It can also help kids in tough times in their life. The more obvious thought that comes to mind is an injury that prevents the student from being able to go to school, so having that option to learn from school is very helpful. There would be other reasons as to why students can't go to school, for example, having a serious sickness that's contagious, or even having severe anxiety and can't handle well with large groups of people. Whatever the case may be, having the option to learn from home while having a severe condition can have a deeper impact on students more than what meets the eye.

While it's true that many people may think that working from home is a terrible idea, but I disagree very much with such thoughts. I can say that students can just work at home, not do any work, sleep in late, and decide to show up for ""school"" whenever they want to. It's a valid point to think of this, but having the option to work from school should be thought of more of a privelidge instead of some free way out of class. Many people could also speculate that some students don't have a wifi router or computer at home, which prevents that possibility. Even though that some people may not have wifi, it could be solved with 1. having the school pay the student a temporary router (possibly involving some expense) and 2. Having either a doctor's note or some type of pass that proves the student of actually being injured or in actual need to stay home from school.

I believe that having the option to learn and work with a teacher at home is a great idea. It opens a path for students to be more engaging in the material while at the same time having the incentive to acctually pay attention to the teacher. Not only that, it gives students who are injured severly in either physically, mentally, or medically a way to catch up on school while not being able to go to school. While this option is only exclusive to a couple of schools as of this moment, it wouldn't be the worst option to work towards this goal and have this option available to students as soon as possible. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D786038182B6,"Have you ever thought about the advatages and disadvantages of learning in school? Distance learning is being consitered instead of in school learning for some students. Being taught online isin't always a good idea. In school learning allows students to work at their own paste, work with less distractions, and allows students to be organized.

When students work at their own paste it can be less stressful, they can make sure everything is valid, and they can focus more on their work. Stress can decrease by increasing the time you have to work on an assignment. You dont have to stare at a clock and worry about reaching your deadline. You can go back to check on your work as many times as you need to. Reviewing your work allows you to correct your mistakes. You can focus when you aren't panicing about losing time to complete an assignment. Being rushed by time can be very stressful and cause problems for a student.

Distractions are never a good thing, so why work with them? Teachers in school create rules for students to be sucessful without the distraction of a cell phone, food being handed out in class, and classmates misbehaving.

Cell phones take up most of a students day and it does not benefit them at all. Cell phones draw students' attention by a notification, phone call, or just being on a desk. Food being handed out in class creates a ruckess by everybody wanting a snack to chew. Wrappers of candy, bags of chips, and sodas being opened creates a noise that is tempting. When a student misbehaves, teachers have the ability to write them up and let upper athorities take action. Distractions cut into the time a student has to complete any assignemnt.

Organization in life can start with school. You have a schedule to follow, you have different subjects, and you have a structure. As soon as your morning alarm goes off you start with your morning routine. First you shower and get dressed, next you brush your teeth, then you may get transported to school. At school they provide students with a shedule to follow. You take four classes a day and have eight in total that are seperated with lunch. Each subject has different learning styles and ways to solve problems. Everything is structured and not given to a point you can't sort things out.

In school learning benifits students to be organized, gives them time to complete their work, and takes away distractions. Working in school has multiple pro's for a student's future.                                  ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
C431BAD29891,"Have you ever wished that you could just dropped out of school, but can't because of how much of a necessity education is? Well todays, the dream of getting educated at home is a reality. through the power of the internet, students are able to attend classes at home. Doesn't it sound amazing to go to school without having to deal with people or even go outside? It probably does, but it may be more harmful than good. The majority of students would not benefit from at-home-classes, because it would restrict their access to resources and would make it harder for them to get the help they need.

An important set of skills, that have been slowly dewendling away, are the often neglected social skills. Yes, if students didn't have to go to school, they wouldn't have to deal with bullies, social anxiety, or small tall, but how would that help them in the much harsher adult would. I'm a shy person; It took me up to the 7th grade before I was able to make my first friend, and I still have to warm up to people before I start talking. Even though my skills are still lacking, I appreciate now how much social confiedence I gained from having access to a place full of people my age. If I took at-home-classes, my social skills would've been a lot worse than they are today. The enviorment that is provide at schools is something everyone should have to experience.

A major flaw of online education is the lack of physical reasources that are often provided in schools. How are you meant to do a science experiement without lab equipement? How are you meant to get a good workout without a gym? How are you meant to learn algebra without a calculator? Many students who would be taking at-home-classes would be taking them because of its ease of access, but it doesn't seem very easy to access the chemical needed for a chemistry experiment. Yes, they could just be provided videos of experiments and uses an online calculator for math, but most students learn better with hands-on-experiences. That solution would just be subjecting them to a less effective form of education.

At my school, we are required to take atleast one online class, and I've noticed that many of my peers do not have the self control needed to stay caught up. Even at my school we have a pacing guide and a teacher making sure we follow it, and people still manage to get behind. By taking a classes at home, you are the only person who can keep you on pace, which obviously would require a lot more restraint. It's inevitable that people will tell themselves that ""they can do it later,"" when they feel overwhelmed by work. On top of that, if students don't understand what they're learning, it wouldn't be hard for them to cheat. At-home-classes offer all kinds of temptations to get you off course, and once your off, its a lot harder to get back on track.

The majority of students would not benefit from at-home-classes, because it would restrict their access to resources and would make it harder for them to get the help they need. They wouldn't learn the social skills they needed for the real world, they would be getting a worse education without access to the equipment offered in most schools, and it would be easy for them to get behind without someone helping them. We need to focus more on improving the school system we have now, instead of making it more complicated by adding at-home-classes. Students should continue going to school, because that is what will better ready them for the rest of their life.",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
4585DE769AE9,"I don't believe the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. First of all, the research showing there is a lot of chance to know about the distance. It's hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing.

The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. It's easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car.

Additional, there are not going to take care them self when they are making online or video. They just focus what there are doing. For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade.

She try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasn't take care her self because she was focusing the video.

Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. Additional, using map is butter than making online or video. Other ways its hard to make online or video for offer the distance. Most students are not going to focus when there are making that.

In conclusion, I don't believe the students would benefits by way of online or video to offer the distance. There is other way to offer the distance from classes to home.",1,Distance learning,Independent,0.0
390C619217DB,"Although distance learning is a great option for schools to potentially use, there are reasons why its both beneficial and non-beneficial. The bad can outweigh the good, and the good can outweigh the bad. Some students can benefit, but some may not. In today's day and age students are getting increasingly lazy, and due to the continuous amount of laziness, we have an obesity epidemic, not just with teens, with most of the population. People just dont take care of themselves, and if some students got to stay home for class, it may get worse. Although, for some students, they may benefit. They can stress much less, be able to manage time better, and take care of their health effectively.

In the U.S., we have an obesity epidemic, and its only getting worse. Allowing students to attend classes from home gives them more access to unhealthy junk food (like chips and candy), and less motive to stay healthy and work out. During school, you have class changes, where you can walk, get in a little bit of exercise. You're also required to take gym at least once, in most public schools. The lunch options are also getting healthier, a good mixture of protein, carbs, fruits, and vegetables. These options and requirements may spark a change in the mindset of these students, these might push them to do better for themselves. But, if someone who is obese is allowed to take classes from home, that gives them a greater chance at furthering their obesity. They can sit around, and snack while taking their classes. They dont have to eat the necessary food groups. They aren't required to go outside and exercise. They're not getting graded on that. Yes, there may be gym class online. But who's to say that they'll be heavily monitored like in a public school setting. They could be let of the hook, not pushed as hard as public school students are pushed, not monitored, or graded for participation that was rightly earned. They could laze around all day, not trying to better themselves or at least somewhat care for themselves. They wouldn't have to strive to get a good grade in classes like gym, like in a public school.

As said before, the health of the U.S. isnt something to proudly show off, but not all of it is due to obesity. We have diabetes, heart conditions, and so many other health problems. There are also mental health conditions. These all make going to school an extra tough part of the day, its debilitating. If students were allowed to take classes from home, they would be able to manage their health better. They could take mental health days without worrying about missing too much school, and not have to go to the nurse or worry when their blood sugar is dropping or spiking. Due to them being able to eat what food they have at home, and being able to track it more effectively than in a school setting. Students would also be able to get up later, sleep in, not having to worry about looking good for their peers, or straining themselves to wake up early. They could also possibly eat healthier, more organic food than what school has. Taking home classes could enable them to better their mindset, and continue trying to eat better and more healthily. They can take their health more seriously, not be sleep deprived or nutrient deprived. The condition of their well being and mental/physical health could improve drastically.

Although we may have problems with the school system, there are some things you can't replace. There are benefits to taking home classes, but it can be non-beneficial. Yes, mental health and physical health can improve for some, but it can be worse for others. Every student is different, every student needs a different way of teaching. Whether it be to come to school, or to stay home and take home classes. Not everyone benefits from the same thing, seeing as the examples listed were contradictory for specific groups. Yes it can help health conditions, but it may be the opposite for the unhealthy.

The idea of doing classes from home is so-so, the examples are a could/couldn't situation. It may happen for some, but it may not for others. Every student knows what they need personally, but not every school is capable of doing what they need. ",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
D45516C802DF,"Ringgggg Ringggggg! *alarm clock goes off* awe jeez school again? Actually maybe not, because some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people may disagree about this idea and they also believe that school builds character among students and disciplines children or some people may actually like attending school *crickets* I don't why anyone in the world would like doing that but lets move on shall we. I actually like the concept of the no school thing it seems really beneficial. You have zero restrictions, if you are sick you can stay home and complete your online tasks, and you have time away from awful teachers. Sounds like a win win situation for everyone!

One thing I really love about this online schooling is that you have no restrictions or rules to follow. Most schools have a policy that if you have six or more unexcused absences, no matter what your grades look like you have legally failed which is really messed up. But if you take online classes you have no absences to worry about. Also you have a lot of free time. For example, in school after you finish you work you have to sit there quietly after everyone finishes their worksheet. Now if you're home alone you have no teacher hassling you for phone or no ones stressing you over work you can work at your own pace and be comfortable in your Elmo pajamas. Lastly you don't have to sit there and hold your bladder because you teacher has a ""1 pass a week rule.""

Secondly, online classes can help you stay on track if you are sick or have a severe illness. For instance, about two and a half years ago I had the flu and I was out of school for about a week or two, so I returned to school only to find out I've missed tons and tons of work. I was so behind and I didn't catch up about three weeks from then. Lastly, online could assist you if your teacher isn't the best at what they do. Most teachers do not really teach their students, they give them little instruction and then they hand out a work sheet and the students have to take the information and piece it together to figure out what to do. Like lets take Generic_Name for example, a math teacher, he doesn't really care if we cheat on our worksheet because he claims he ""taught it to us already.""

Some people may disagree about the idea of online classes. Some people may think public schools help develop character by having friends, interacting with other students, and talking to teachers. Also most parents think children need discipline in their lives which the school provides with the rules and restrictions. Another reason some people may disagree is that some people...may actually.... enjoy school...eh. Despite these reasons, I still support online schooling because it provides us free time, time away from teachers, and freedom from restrictions and rules.

I hoped I help shine some light on why online schooling is an excellents idea. It provides us free time, time away from teachers, and freedom from restrictions and rules. And I hope they bring a program like that to Generic_School very soon. *Mom yells* ""hurry up before you miss the bus!""",5,Distance learning,Independent,0.8
5ACA20C17FED,"Many schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. Some students learn better when their teacher explains the work directly to them. Distance learning would be good for students who are sick and can not attend school. This could also be good for students who get in trouble a lot. Distance learning is good for students who are sick or students who do not learn well in a classroom environment, and in some classes it could be good for students that get in a lot of trouble.

Many students learn better when their teacher explains something directly to them. I know many students who always complain that they do not understand what the teacher is teaching the class, then when the teacher comes to their desk and explains it directly to them they understand. It would be beneficial to the students who do not work well in a classroom environment with other students. These students would prefer for it to be just the teacher in the room explaining the work to them because they can concentrate more.

Distance learning could be useful for students that are sick and can not come to school. Many students get behind on their school work when they are sick and can not catch up on work when they get back to school because the teacher is giving out more work for them to do. If a sick student was using distance learning then they could complete their work at home as soon as the teacher assigned it. This would prevent students from being behind on their school work.

Distance learning could be a good and easy alternative for students who like to get in trouble a lot in school. It would benefit them because they can not start trouble with other students or mess up any school property. This way they can be away from any trouble at school and still acquire a good education. If they start to show that their behavior has changed then the school may think about putting him/her back in school.

Some people may not agree with distance learning and say that a sick student can finish their work at school or that a student who does not learn well in a classroom should pay more attention in class. However, teachers are not going to stop teaching their class for a day so that one student that was sick can catch up on their work. Students who can not concentrate in classrooms would learn more if they were signed up for distance learning than if they stayed in a classroom where they could not concentrate. This can be helpful for many students if their school participated in it.

Distance learning can be beneficial for many students who understand their work better when a teacher is teaching directly to them or for students who like to start a lot of trouble at school. Many students like when the teacher teaches the work to them individually. Sick students can use distance learning to catch up and their missed work. Troublesome students should be signed up for distance learning because they can be at home away from trouble and still learn what the teacher has been teaching in class.",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
07555937FA5D,"Distance Learning has been a major issue, schools wonder if it's a good idea to provide distance learning or not. I believe it's a wonderful idea to have schools provide distance learning, it allows students with disabilities to learn, student in hospitals with illnesses to learn too and for single parents to learn and take care of their kids as well. Disabilities can be a major obstacle to get to school.

People with physical disabilities have to do a lot more to go to school, they can't take a bus or drive themselves.

The stress of moving all the time must be tiring. Distance Learning allows students with physical disabilities to feel not stress and be in the comfort of their own homes. Students with oxygen tanks don't have to carry the oxygen tank everywhere they go and just can stay home and learn. Students with major anxiety can learn and not have to feel anxious every time they go to school and have panic attacks. In general, distance learning provides a lot of help to students with disabilities. Distance Learning can also help student in hospitals.

Not everyone in this world can go to school, students can get a serious illness/diseases and must stay at the hospital. How do these students get education usually they don't, but with distance learning they can. Distance learning allows students with cancer or other illness to get the care they need and get education at the same time. Once the student gets discharged they don't need to learn everything they missed, they can pick up where they left off with last class online. Distance learning allows everyone to get an equal opportunity to learn, even single parents.

Many single parents drop out of school to take care of their kid and get a job. Many of these single parents have to work low paying jobs due to the lack of education, distance learning allows these parents to either finish college or high school. This allows these parents to get higher paying jobs and to provide more for their kids. Single parents don't have to feel trap and have to wait to get their education. Education is needed to be successful in today's world, single parents who can't get education will feel like they can't be successful. Distance learning allows these parents to be successful in today's world.

Some may say that you don't get that real teacher student relationship online, but you still feel connected, inspired or inspire others online. Just because it's online doesn't mean you lose any sense of human interaction. Education is hard to get for people who can't go to schools or is hard to. Students can get the education they need without leaving their house or hospital. Distance learning like I said before allows an equal learning opportunity for all. ",4,Distance learning,Independent,0.6
