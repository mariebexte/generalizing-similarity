D93992A086FE,"Cars have been around for awhile and they have had a major impact on society. Many people believe that there is no problem with the frequency of cars being driven. But, there are many advantages to less car use such as improving our cities and suburbs, improving safety, and decreasing pollution.

Many have tried to make cities a little more dense and better for walking but nothing has seemed to work; therefore, they have moved on to suburbs. Now, people are trying to make suburbs better for getting around while walking instead of driving. By doing so, places such as shops will be made closer and more convienent which allows people to be able to consider walking as a better option. By having these suburbs, and soon hopefully cities, reduce the amount of cars used, the people living in these areas will be able to accomplish more in a healthier and safer way.

Safety has been an issue in almost all areas due to a variety of reasons; one being cars. People pass by ""Drive Safely"" signs or memorials on the side of the road too often. Many accidents occur because of all the cars and traffic and careless driving. By reducing the amount of cars being driven, the moment of deaths in car accidents can be reduced as well. In ""The End of Car Culture"", author Elisabeth Rosenthal states, ""Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" Recently, teenagers who are able to get their license haven't really made it a priority. This could be caused by factors such as fear of driving or just because they've figured out a way around driving. Not everyone needs a car to get around; there are plenty of other ways to safely get from point A to point B.

Another large issue cars contribute to is pollution. Pollution is in every city, every state, every country, every continent. Cars are ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..."" (Rosenthal, Elisabeth, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars""). Cars don't help with environmental issues what-so-ever. They add to the smog issues and they increase the about of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In the capital of France, for example, congestion was down sixty percent due to smog causing delivery companies to lose money since they couldn't delieve what was needed. Cars are extremely harmful to the environment and they make the issues we already have even larger. By limiting car usage, people could hopefully work on repairing the damage we have already done to the environment instead of worsening it.

Cars have impacted society ever since they were made. By reducing the amount of cars driven, cities and suburbs can be improved, better safety can be implimented, and pollution will reduce. Until then, the issues cars create will continue to get worse and by the time people see it, the problems will be too late to fix.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
A0A1B3E16EE5,"World war II was the start of development centering cars but; in the recent years the popularity as well as the traffice has gone down because of limiting car usage which have lots of advantages. Limiting the use of cars advantages are less air pollution and new communities

Initially, less car usage means less carbon emissions which leads to less air pollution. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of "" The End of Car Culture"" wrote ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the enviorment since transportation is the second largets source of America's emmisions..."". Limiting the use of cars will have a really big benefit on the enviorment by stopping more emmisions from damaging the O-zone layer. For example in Bogota, Colombia they have a day called ""Day Without Cars"" and Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman who lives ther says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" from ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" written by Andrew Selsky. People living there have seen the benefits of the limits on cars and thinks it's a really good thing for their cityand not even rain can stop people from participating says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus.

Additionally, these limititations have created new communities by building places that are very easy to get to. For example, Elisabeth Rosenthal author of ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" wrote ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away on a main street, Rather than in malls along some distant highway."" With the new approach of limithing car usage things are built closer making many things accessible to everyone. For example, Andrew Selsky the author of ""Car-free day is spinning into big hit in Bogota"" wrote ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions dramatically cut traffic; and new restraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."". With the changes of accessibility buissness owners have to come where the money is making everything more accessible and creating new things in the area. Building things closer attracts more people which means more homes being built and more families enoying the community.

Clearly, the advantages of limiting car usage is amazing because it means less air pollution and new communities. Limitations on car usage will benefit us and the world.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7FCBE68F5923,"Is there a possibillty that we can live a better life without the use of cars? Yes there is many counties have stoped the use of cars because it's cheaper. For example in VAUBAN,Germany they have given up theif cars street parking,driveways,and home garages are generally forbidden. Vauban's streets are car free except the main thorougfare of course. 70% of Vaubans's familis do not own cars, and 57% sold there cars to move there. Many people say that when they had a car there were more tense they say there much happier this way without a car.

Cars come with a responasabillaty thers so much dangrous things that can happen to you while in a car. For example all the accedentd people get in each day hundres ot thousands of people die each year for car crashes. Also people who cause the accedents like drunk driving, or texting while driving ect.. Any little thing can happen in a car that can take your life forever just with a blink of an eye. In other cases like getting pulled over and the incerance you have to pay and all the money we spent daily on gas.

While in BOGOTA,Colombia they have a no car day! It all started in  the 1990's where there was traffic jams it was 3 straight years cars been  banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this city of 7 million people. But a man named Carlos Arturo he rode a two seated bicycle with is wife other two colombians saw hin and decided to do the same. tjis becaqme big everyone stared doing this and they even smoothen out the side walks for the bikes. The streats where busy with bike traffic.

I think we  should start walking places like for example if you need to go to the store and you have one right neer your home dont get in your car walk. By doing this it will help us save gas money and get excerce. Many american are over weight because they dont get any excerce. So by not using our cars once and a while it will help us and our invierment it will stop so much palustion caused  by cars. we should take some time off our car and enjoy nature.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
FDAD27942E2C,"Many cities around the world have already learned the benifits to limiting or getting rid of car usage. A few of these cities are Vauban, Paris, Bogota. These cities experience less smog and pollution.

People in the places that have limited car uses do not seem to mind. A quote from

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal explans how giving up their car has improved their live, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"". Cars do cause alot of tension and stress from being in trafic and having to deal it bad drivers on the road. Many people are already too stressed and anything that can limit stress is good for you.

In Bogota, Colombia the city has ond day that is car-free. This day people hike, skate, or used public transportation to get where they needed to be. Violaters are fined $25. The over all goal of this day is to promote diffrent forms of transportation. Even though weather can be a factor it didnt seem to affect people.

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky states how this is true ""The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota."" This quote also shows that people are fine surviving with out cars.

Paris baned driving for diffrent cars on diffrent days because of the near-record pollution. Moday cars with even-numbered license would be fined 22-euros if they drove and the next day the rule would apply to odd-numbered licences. There were exceptions for cars that are plug-in, car pools with three or more people, and hybids. Robert duffer, the author of

Paris bans driving due to smog showes how well the ban worked in this quote 'The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to riscind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"". This is a great example of how much polution would be cut out if we stopped or limmited useing cars. Just one day with out everyone using cars and there was a diffrence in the smog amount.

Limiting car usage also will cut carbon emitions and help the enviroment. In

The End of Car Culture the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal states ""...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions..."" With a limit on cars, trucks, and other moter veicals greenhouse gas emissions will lower. America is already lowering it's car usage by it's self. People are buying fewer cars, getting fewer licenses, and driving less all together.

Over all the affect with giving up moter veicals and finding other forms of transpertation are very positive. People would have less stress, reduce in greenhouse gasses, and lower pollution.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
61346BD417B0,"Cars have long been viewed as a common method of transportation from point A to point B. However, in the world that we live in cars have become a burden and limited use would be best. Efforts to reduce car usage have shown to reduce the rate of carbon dioxide produced and smog. The elimination of car use would lead way to further development for other methods of transportation. Countries have taken the first step in banning car usage and its citizens have admitted to living nice and happier lives than they had before.

Common issues faced by car use is the production of carbon dioxide and the risk of smog. Smog is a health hazard to those with asthma, young children, and the elderly. By limiting the use of a car, carbon dioxide and smog rates would plummet dramatically. When Paris was faced with smog at near-record levels driving was banned and after a day of the driving ban smog levels were dropping already. Cars, a major contributor to carbon dioxide production, can decrease the rate of the greenhouse effect by limiting their use. Nearly 50 percent of the United State's greenhouse emissions come from the use of cars alone. By not driving your car the rate of greenhouse emissions would drastically decrease.

Besides the nice look to a car, cars are often used because there appears to be no other way to travel long distances. Other methods of transportation such as riding a bicycle, public transportation, and even walking are viable and beneficial methods of transportation. On bike you travel further than you would walking at a faster rate, Bogota has begun the develpment of 118 miles of bicycle paths in hopes of reducing traffic and carbon dioxide emmisions. A near 80 percent of appropraitions are used on highways, the rest of the 20 percent are used on other methods of transportation. By finding other methods of transportation (ie. walking, biking, public transportation) the 80 percent used on highways could be used to greatly improve other methods of transportation, like public transport.

The thought of parting from our cars is a terrifying idea, however countries around the world have taken the initiative and made these ideas law, laws that are benefiting their copuntries. In Germany an ecperimental community, Vauban, has little to no car activity. 70 percent of its families do not own a car and 57 percent sold their car to move to the community. Startingly, not only is this small community a success but many residents claim to be happier than they were when they owned a car. Columbia, like Germany banned the use of cars for one day in Bogota. Not only is everyone enthusiatic of the event but this day has led to the reduction of smog in Bogota.

The question to drive a car is a simple one. Why drive a car when you can walk, ride a bicycle, or can take the bus? By limiting our car use we'll reduce the rate of carbon dioxide emissions and smog. Other countries have tested and proven that life without a car is not only realistic but very beneficial to how one feels. With the options of other forms of transportation we should limit our use of the car. In doing so we'd be improving our lives and the rate of the greenhouse effect.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E0C57C8B7FFA,"Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors.

To begin, when we look at studies we find that when people use their cars immensely, there is a harmful effect in our atmosphere, also reffered to as The Greenhouse Effect. France has been a major component to this harmful gas, as explained by Robert Duffer in the passage

Paris bans driving due to smog

""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..."" In addition, Duffer continues to provide evidence to this claim by further emphasizing and comparing ""[Last] week Paris had 147 miocrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"" By including this simple sentence, we are fully aware of just how much harm pollution has done to the environment due to car uage in Paris. Moreover, the smog in Paris was so intense that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Although almost 4,000 drivers were fined, the smog had cleared enough by Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. This movement is also spreading to places such as Bogota, Colombia where they have a day free of cars with the exception of taxis and buses; for example, in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza explains ""It's a good opputunity to take away stress and lower air polution,"" Many ideas are being formed to show that people care about what their harmful ways have done and are looking to find solutions to minimize the pollution and undo what wrong has been done.

Buying cars over the years has become quite an expense to everyone and has become somewhat burden-like. By limiting and even canceling out the use of cars people have cut down expenses greatly. Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accomodate those who have made this decision by making public transit ""free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" according to the BBC in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog . As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently.  Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article

The End of Car Culture when she includes ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when ""Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work."" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor.

Not only are the advantages of limiting car usage subtle however they are also direct and can have immediate positive effects on people. By making sure people do not overdo the amount they utilize their cars, they become less stressed, have a healthier environment, and save money. This issue is worldwide however, the solution is becoming worldwide as well creating exceptional results and care from car drivers and people are really thinking outside of the box to make magic happen.

22AC599CAE0C,"I was very excited about my first trip to the West Coast (California) that I took last summer. It was a place Ive always fantazized over because of its variety of beauty from the surfing beaches to the skiing mountains to the north. When I first landed in LA, I expected some hustle and bustle of the city like Miami, but it was overwhelming to see the smog and traffic that polluted many peoples views of California, along with the air. Unfortunately, this is the case in many car intensive cities across the globe where limiting car usage would go a great deal farther than people actually know. The advantages of limiting car usage would allow for cleaner cities with less air pollution, and provide safety for pedestrians and even other car-users.

According to source 1 on car-free cities, Elizabeth Rosenthal states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas of the United States"" (Rosenthal, paragraph 5). This stat only presents part of the problem as the commercial and delivery industry add to that figure as well. Limiting car usage across the world is becoming more and more porular, as people finally come to realize the devastating effects of the greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere. Projects in places like France, Colombia, the United States, and other countries across the globe are making a huge effort at reducing car usage, and according to source 4 by Rosenthal, they seem to be working. "" Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by""(paragraph 29). Obviously, car usage altogether will not end, but limiting it can do a great deal in protecting the only planet sustainable for human life.

Furthermore, limiting the use of cars in areas of large pedestarian population, such as New York City, would ultimately lead to less tragic car accidents. Approximately 500 car accidents occur daily in the United States and probably upwards of 5000 across the globe. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in many societies which is unfortunate because almost all are preventable. Its when the driver is given too much power behind the wheel that their guard is let down. The rise of cellphones and texting have not helped the situation at all either. The good news is that the programs used worldwide solely for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, are also reducing car accidents. "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Duffer, paragraph 14). Also in source 3 describing Bogota's Car free day is spreading to other countries of Latin-America with the intention of reducing traffic and allowing safer passage for pedestrians.

Ultimately, the importance of limiting car-usage across the world is being seen as crucial and is starting to take off. Limiting car usage reduces air pollution which is a serious threat to humanity these days, and also diminishes car related accidents. At the end of my trip to California, I was able to see the real beauty of the nature outside the city, when I got off the highway.                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5CC4975A833D,"Nowadays, pedestrians mostly travel by automobiles. It could be a car, a bus, or even a plane. But there is always a way to get from one place to another. What if this way of traveling wasn't right for this planet? After all, vehicles can cause global warming. Which isn't a good thing, It can make alot of things go wrong. But if we know this, why do we still carry on with our daily lives to drive vehicles that is a danger to our world.

Vauban, A city in Germany, Is a place for people who dont appreciate this cause. Vauban is a ""car-free"" city which houses five thousand fivehundred and fifity-five residents. The city itself was finish being built in 2006. Basically, its a city to separate suburban life from auto use. This movement is called ""smart planning"". The stores are closer to the towns where people live in, but more like being walking distance.

Paris once had suffered for a few days because of the cause of pollution. The troops stationed there had enforced a partial law to ban driving, to clear the air of the global city. On a Monday, each motorists with even-numbered license plates were given two options. To leave their cars at home or suffer a twenty-two euro fine. This rule was also appointed to the odd-numbered plates the following day. Arond four thousand drivers were fined, and their vehicles were impounded. They say that Diesel fuel was to blame. The colder nights and warmer days had caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. France has a policy that favors diesel over gasoline.

In Bogota, Columbia, There is a program that has been set up to spread out to other countries. The program is where citizens of their own country ( Or where they currently live), decide to find other means of travel instead driving their own vehicle to work. They could hike, ride a bike, or skate to work during this ""Day Without Cars"". This is the third year in a row that they have perfomed this task, with the acception for taking buses or taxi's if needed be. The goal of this program is to promote an alternative transportation and to reduce smog. People who violate this program are fined with twenty-five dollars.

Hence, Not everyone says or thinks that taking a walk instead of driving is a bad idea. A few countries accept it and so do small towns in bigger continents, who would rather drive than ride. Overall, this is helping us out in many ways. Global warming has been getting worse in the past few days. But if everyone could quit driving their vehicles every now and then. It would lower the pollution in the air that we have caused.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
ED96E3AB5161,"The effects of greenhouse gas emission began to take their toll on the earth's atmosphere simply by its own natural output. As time has gone on though, and humans and their ways of transportation have evolved, greenhouse gas emission is becoming more of a problem. Automobiles, mainly cars, play a huge role in the production of nasty fumes and gases that become trapped in the atmosphere. For example, in Europe passenger cars make up twelve percent of total greenhouse gas emission, and in heavily congested areas such as the United States-it can skyrocket up to fifty percent!

Some nations/countries are beginning to take a new approach to battle the ""War of Greenhouse Gases"". As studies have shown that national driving levels and the amount of people purchasing cars and earning their licenses are dropping after their peak in 2005, people are more and more willing to put down the car keys and put on their running shoes. One of these places in particular is the city of Vauban and is located in Germany. It is a middle-class to upper class community and its citizens can be considered pioneers of suburbia. Vauban does not permit driving in it's limits, besides the main thoroughfare, and a few side streets. Car owners buy a space for their car for $40,000 alongside a home.

While some might argue about the practicality of not driving your car if you have one, it's shown to be extremely beneficial not only for the environment, but for people as well. When you go outside, whether you're headed somewhere or just on a casual stroll, you may reach Nirvana as you enjoy the true sounds of nature. In places where cars are permitted to drive, you might hear the sound of birds chirping outside your window, or the calm rustle of leaves rustling in the wind, but the rumbles, roars, and honks of a car are not far behind. In areas such as Vauban, the beautiful sounds of the world won't be drowned out by a greasy hunk of steel.

Besides feeling at peace, a life without a car is a healthier life! Now, when you want to go somewhere, you must rely on your own two feet. Those two feet, bicycle, skateboard, etc. will be all you need to get where you're going! Unlike many places though, everything is within walking distance for convenience and to encourage you to take these steps. Notice the physical and emotional changes in yourself once in a place with no cars-you'll feel more relaxed, less rushed, and your body will thank you.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Why is this forbidden? i just don't get it. Car owners buy there own space, for $40,000 along with there home. In Europe passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car reduced. Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new federal. So fellow citizens should help them out with there limiting car usage. they sure have a lot going on. Like in the end of car culture.

What about if it was raining how are we suppsoed to get to work or get food. we need a car to get to places. They say the rain hasn't stopped people from participating. But i think it has stopped them. Therefore we need are cars to get to where we need to be.      ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B8748AECBD72,"Limiting car usage has many advantages, from saving money, from helping save the planet. We spend tons and tons of dollars on a simple fossil fuel just so we can get around. Although, having a car may be nice, but also you may need to think about the long term consequences that are yet to come. For example, driving around while fun, is dangerous, you are facing the threats of drunk drivers, people not paying attention or something in general going wonky with your car, or how incredibly expensive cars are, you must buy the gas fill it up almost every two days, you will have to pay for any damages and also for the tune ups. Cars arent just expensive but they also do loads of damage to the environment. Cars, create fumes that are let out into the atmosphere that contributes to global warming. Sure, it may be nice to fdrive a big bubba truck with huge tires, some smoke stacks and to be able to ""roll coal"" but also think about what that does to the earth, it helps melt glaciers causing polar bears to be hot and hungry.

Driving a car may be convenient, but when something is convenient something else has to suffer. This something else would be the environent, there is less and less clean air for us to breathe, everything is getting hotter and everyone is suffering. Smog is one of the most relavent and visible issues, especially in bigger cities. Smog is a mixture of smoke, and fog, this smoke coming from vehicles and mostly factories. Going into a major city like New York City may be fun but while your there look around and notice the thick layer of smog. You are breathing all of that through out your body. While New York City may not be the smoggiest city around such as Beijing (Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, Line 14) but it is still an on going issue everywhere.

All in all, leaving your car at home and taking a bike to work instead can have many health benefits but also many environmental benifits, so next time you think about bringing your car to work, think of the polar bears and the future of the environment.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
18DCD0C5C34F,"All around the world, people are using gas-gusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""Car-Free Day"" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partial-driving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a long-term positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of green-house gases is one of the common issues troubling countries world-wide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depleation of Earth's Ozone layer. According to

Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,

""[The Smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" The city of Paris had legislated, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day"" (

Source 2

). Resulting from their legislation, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (

Source 2

). Paris, originally one of the worlds' most-polluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the odd-numbered license plates the next day. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (

Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

). A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the Car-Free Day was ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (

Source 3: Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota

). The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban; there would be no energy-crisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the beta-countries (France, Colombia, and Germany) have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on

Source 3 , in Bogota, ""... a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Rather than having a holier-than-thou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the car-free day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to

Source 3 , ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bike-sharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to

Source 4: The End of Car Culture , ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of car-sharinf programs across the nation."" Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The long-term culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to

Source 4 , ""The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (

Source 1

). Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" (

Source 1

). This modern-day industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

), it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The long-term culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and long-term culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a car-free enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6ED603E059F7,"limiting car usage would be great for all of us around the world. It would be good for us to function regurlaly without a car. It would show us how people a long time ago got to different places by waliking or public transportation. I think by all of us not using cars will make us see how grateful we are for having cars. By us not having a cars it would help with our air pollution,help us get daily excercise,and help us spend less money on technology.

Although cars are a great benefit to our lives it can harm us as well. For example in Paris they had a near record breaking smog problem due to all the cars. The people of paris thought that diesel was the problem. Paris has more air pollution than any other European capitals. In recent recorded data paris had ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.9 in london"" (paragraph 17 line 2-4). This shows that cars have a big advantage in our society today and a big part of our health as well.

Not having a car is good for us because it gives us daily excercise. By walking or riding a bike to work or school is good for our bodies. It allows us to take a breath of fresh air and enjoy nature and clear our minds. By walking to work it allows to take away stress and focus on what you are going to do that day. Not having a vehicle is good for us and makes us take advantage of life.

Lastly not having a car saves money. Being carless saves us money on gas and oil changes. If your car breaks down;thats extra money you have to spend on for car parts. If you got into a car accident you would have to pay for not only your car ,but the other persons car as well. You could save tons of money for yourself and your family by not having a vehicle. Not having a car quickly improves your health and your pockets.

This lifestyle will be healthy for all of us and shows us all we maybe missing out on. We as people rely to much on technology and put our everything into these devices. By us doing this it will improve our way of living.                                 ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E821935D8F15,"Cars come in different colors, and are what we use to transport anything. Whether it a family going on vacation, going to  work or going to school.  With all of these possible benfits and more is what we gain from cars. We don't realize how cars really have an effect in our everyday changing world. That the moment we put the car key in to turn on the car we are creating are more hazordous world for the present time and  the furture to come. By,limiting car usage in the world we can do many postive and beneficial things like in our atmosphere,  becoming a independent person without the need of a car, and to be relive as oneself.

To begin with, pollution can be reduced like never ever before in are world named history. Pollution now in days is just terrible to have. It not just make it difficult  for us to breathe but, as well it destroy the atmoshere that we need protect us from the harmful rays of the sun. The greenhouse effect can be lowered if we limit the use of cars. This can be actually proven with the following exert of the passage,"" And that experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" (Source #1) The point that I'm really trying to convey, is that we can do this all together if we limit the car usage. There should be a well and profounded effort to do so. Another example would be that if we dont limit the usage of cars we can not have a fresh and clear atmoshere. Can you imagine a day that you wake up to find, that all that was around you be nothing but a smog and prevent you to see and do anything? The car we have produce dangerous toxic that can up in are air and can be very hard for us later on. But if limit car usage, we can prevent this from happening. Not, just us but to other place in the world. This was what happen in France ,to prevent the usage for cars producin that smog they created an renforce day to prevent the use of car. Which lead to a shocking over turn of news. Like so in the following,""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France"" (Source #2) What I'm trying to inform once again is that we limit we can create a better fit living world to be in. This is one advantages that we can do as fellow citizens in our country

Which lead to me to my othe point, there is more that we have in advantage of limiting the usage of cars. It is a way of ""smart planing"" ourself as a community. We can live a more free caring world without the need of a car. Technology can play a part in the limit of of car usage. As stated in the folllowing ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" (Source #4)See this occur and happen this a will fitted advantage to us all. Another, advantage that we have in hand is the ability to relieve our stress level to a much stable level. which lead to me to my other insight of information, ""When I had a car I was alwaystense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter"" (Source #1) Being in the car makes it complicated and diifficult. This is another way for us take advantage to limit the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantegous for that we can benifit from that if we limit the use of care by lower pollution in are atmospher, creating a more benficial way for ouself without the need of a car, the relive of oneself.

15DF5443F192,"Citizens cars are good to have but all the fines and stress they are putting on us makes us not wont to buy a car. But now i see we need to have a change and just start walking and finding another way other then our cars because they are talking about fining and impounding our cars the ones (Cars) we paid full cash for.

To start off with, accroding to the article in ''Life Goes On Without Cars'', u could park at a garage but its gotta be ownship and u would have to buy space that cost $40,000, along with a home. For example, u would have to buy a house pay for that rent and also pay for the parking fee that u brought with the house. So with that being said u should just buy a house, and not own a car and just walk, ride a bike ,or take a bus to where every u got to go.

Secondly, now there saying in article ''Driving due to smog'' On Monday motorists with-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31).The same would apply to odd-numbered plated the following the day. That's not right because you brought your  car, but you could only drive it a certain day (would ever the law says). The understanding that I'm getting is you got to follow the law rules when ever that applies to the goverment people, which is understandable. But my point is I brought my car and i should be able to drive my car when ever I feel like it.

Futher more, Now they  want to have a ''Car Free Day'' In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, they say millions of Colombins hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. For example, If the people did drive on a car-free day they would face $25 fine. So if it rained and u needed to get somewhere you could't drive u would have to take a bus, walk, train, or skate. Or you would be fined.

In Closing, from the understanding that I'm getting,  I advise everyone to take the bus,walk,skate,bike,or hike just to get to where you got to be also you could just not own a car. Because either way, if u break the rules you are going to be to be fine or  they could impounded your car and thats would be a lot of mess  becasue you paid for a car but u gotta pay the fine and pay to get your car out the impounded. So EVERYONE just walk,bike,hike,skate,or take a train or bus.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
33AC59C82DE5,"Many people in the United States are becoming more and more aware of the advantages of limiting car usage. Many don't find this important or feel uncomfortable adapting new customs but it is very important to limit car usage. Limiting car usage contributes to many factors in cities and can also help the environment.

First of all, limiting car usage contributes to the way cities, towns, or suburbs are. For example; The first article ""Car-Free Cities"" shows an example of a suburb in Germany where people have given up their cars. This suburb; Vauban, Germany, has been a success and even 57 percent of the people living there have sold their cars in order to live there, while 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. A media trainer, Heidrn Walter, said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I', much happier this way,"" and it's not only her that feels this way, many otheer people in this suburb have experienced and enjoyed the no-car-feeling. Also, this article states that a low-car suburban life makes suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. This makes living there a lot more easier and comfortable.

Second, limiting car usage helps the environment. According to the first article; ""Car-Free-Cities"" says that ""Passenger cars are responcible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" and that ""emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" These two facts show how bad cars are for the environment, and not only that, but also, cars polute the air horribly. For example, in the second article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" said that ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This smog has affected a lot of cities as well and now one of the main goals people have is to promote alternative transportation due to this.

To conclude, there are many advantages of limiting car usage and and not limiting is hurting the world. Everyone should be more conciderate of their environment and limit their car usage.            ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
0E66C9CE5B7C,"Limiting car usage could have many advantages on our planet. Many cities, such as Vauban in Germany, have given up on using cars to help the world around them. ""Vauban's streets are completely car-free, except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community."" There is a movement going on called, ""smart planning"" and Vauban is just one example of a growing trend in Europe of limiting auto use. The article says that passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. It seems that the people in Europe are realzing that so much car usage is harming their environment, and they are trying to set a trend for other countries like the United States to follow to limit using cars.

How much people use their cars is very important. Polluted air is a very widespread problem in many regions of the world. Paris had days of near-record pollution, and decided to enfore a partial driving ban to try to help clear the air of the city. The article says that almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and twenty-seven had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog."" The driving ban helped clear the smog, because it reduced car emissions. Paris has more smog than many other European capitals, which is why reducing how much citizens drive their cars is a good idea.

Some cities have days that are completely car free. Bogota, Colombia is one of them. They have been having a Day Without Cars for three straight years. Cars are banned for the day and buses and taxis are the only exception. The city holds about 7 milion people, and had a large turnout. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay even said that, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders."" The Day Without Cars has even helped stores and sports center come up throughout the city. Instead of shopping centers along a highway, those stores are now in the city and easy to get to without having to use a car.

Researchers have been studying America's ways of car usage and driving. America is home to the first cars like the Model T, or ""Mustang Sally."" Vehichles have always been a huge part of culture, but it seems now that that might not be the case anymore. ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" Researchers are actually hoping that the pattern continues because it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions on the environment. Transportation is the second largest source, behind power plants, of emissions. Many changes have now happened in America, which are making using cars not as important. ""With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.."" The article says. If we could slow down the usage of cars and emission, maybe we could help the planet become a better place.

Since the percentage of car usage has gone down in America, so has the percentage of getting a license. There has been a large drop in 16-39 year olds getting a license, Mr. Sivak's research has found. Older people are also likely to retain their licenses as they age. Mr. Sivak and another man both have children of about the same age, 19 and 21, and live in busy cities where a car could be useful. Neither one of them has their licenses, even though they are interested, but they don't really see the need for one when they can use public transportation or car-pool with their friends. The article says that a study last year has also found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Whether or not this changes as these young people grow older, these decreases in driving are proving that cars might just not be as important as they used to be.

Our planet is just continuing to get worse from emissions from cars. Some countries are starting to realize this and are working hard to limit car usage and have citizens rely just on public transportation, walking, or riding a bike. Bill Ford proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial, and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve safety."" Citizens all over the world can work together to reduce car usage and better improve our planet.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5A3EB7A7A627,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. for example, passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Another example is that all around the world there are attempts to make suburbs and communitys more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less parking spaces. This is a new approach in which stores are placed a walk away or on a main street. Not like malls who usually are along some distant highway. In vauban 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here. In the united states the environmental protection acency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities like vauban.

In paris after near-record pollution they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On monday even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave there cars at home of the would have to pay $31. they did the same for the odd-numbered plates the followinf day. Almost 4,000 people were fined. One good thing though is that congestion was down 60 percent in the capital france, after 5 days of intenssifying smog. Paris typically has more smog than other european capitals. In Bogota, Colombia millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman said ""it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" He was riding a two-seat bike with his wife.

In the United States recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: has america passed peak driving? When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by Dough Short of advisor perspectives, an investment company. A sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its mobilities research and policy center, MiMi Sheller said that ""different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long term cultural shift"". She says it allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet people. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. Mr. Sivak's research has found that there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age. A study found that driving by a young age decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

As you can tell the advantages of limiting car usage are that it helps clear the air, reduce smog and take stress away. It also lowers air pollution and helps with making the greenhouse gas emissions in europe go down. Another thing is that it is a great way to promote alternative transportation. These are some on the many advantages of limiting car usage.                    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
30B80CDBD018,"A decline in the use of motor vehicles would greatly help the whole world in many unique ways. Most importantly, cars have an awful effect on the enviornment. Eliminating motor vehicles all together would remove many of the polutants effecting the eviornment. Also, removing cars has a great effect on the community as well by helping places to grow and prosper. Finally, the thought of limiting car usage is trending rapidly with the common man as well as higher ups in the government.

Cars produce up to 12% of Europe's greenhouse gases and up too 50% of America's greenhouse gas. High levels of greenhouse gas absorb heat and prevent it from leaving Earth's atmosphere causing a rise in temperature better known as global warming. Second, the carbon monoxide and other noxious chemicals that are released by vehicles can come together to form a thick smog. This somg is very bad for people's health and can contaminate land and water with toxic chemicals. In order to prevent these two things a lack of usage of cars is necesary in today's world.

Just like the enviornment, reduced car usage also can benifit your very own community. Citizens reported being ""much happier this way"" as well as being less tense after restrictions on cars were imposed. Second, a lack of car usage would caue much denser cities. In turn, buisness that were staged on highways would become local and  city centers would allow friends to live close by. Finally, in cities that imposed bans on motor vehicles parks and sports centers were not only revived but began to completely flourish.

Finally, laws about car usage are smiled upon by both pedestrians but by people in legislative positions. Fist off, European places like Switzerland and France first adopted these types of rules. As a result, events like car free day in Bogota became a big sucess with many supporters. Therefore, even president Barack Obama revealved a plan to be imposed that limits the usage of cars in America. Finally, sociological professors like Mimi Sheller have noticed people accepting and embracing the new anti car policies.

In turn, restricting car usage has nothing but good to offer the majority of cities. From helping reduce the global problem of polution. Or, helping to build bigger more tightly knit cities. The new very popular laws will be imposed in many Eurpoean countires and sonn the U.S. As a result, the positive effects will be embraced by communities for generations to come.

Some pros about not having cars are that more people are exercising and losing weight, and reducing the pollution in the air. Some even say you can get where you're going faster when not using a automobile.

Many of the problems that create this are the densely populated areas with high car usage. In Europe in 2006 there government finished construction on a town that had no garages or drive ways, the only place to park was a garage that you had to buy a spot in for $40,000 witch you payed for along with your house.

During their last year millions of people walked on their car-free day even when it rained showing that people want to make a difference and positively help their enviroment.

In some areas like Paris where pollutants are at 147 micrograms per cubic meter drastic actions had to made during its peak on smog. The city of Paris put a partial ban on driving reducing the smog by 60 percent.

Some communities like Vauban, Germany have created car free suburbs and building lifestyle around that. Instead of large suburbs like we have here in the States they have focused on making shopping within walking distance. People of Vauban have been reported to being less stressed and more happy after living in a car free community. However; this is not the most practical here efforts can be made to redesign how we live such as making super markets easier to access on an everyday basis and only buying the groceries that you need for a couple of days instead of a week or two. This trend has brought people from all over Germany to live there and has set a trend changing how other communites live there lifestyle.

Giving up cars has can build a better life for you and the planet by reducing pollution and lowering your stress but it in order for its full benefits it needs to be done as a community.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
AEA5258DB0D5,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage, for exmple, it lowers the amount of emmisons present in the atmosphere which can lead to a better planet. All around the world people have started using cars less and less because of the problems they cause, such as polution and traffic, and have started moving to a better idea of society where everyone lives in a closer area with stores and jobs within walking distance. The life of cars is ending but our life is just getting better.

Since the times of World War 2, people have had the idea of spread-out homes and private garages but with new times come new ideas, new ideas of closer centered, compact cities. These new cities would have most shops and businesses in close quarters with housing to reduce the need for automobiles and have walking as a more reliable mode of transportation as well as a small amount of public transportation to assist with the more lengthy distances between home and work. In this new approach stores are placed closer to home along walkways rather than in malls along highways in the distance. This would reduce the space needed for the shopping centers as well due to the fact that they would no longer need large parking lots for all the vehicles that were once needed to commute to and fro.

Emissions and greenhouse gases have been a problem in modern society due to the fact that almost everyone has an automobile. This has been creating a large amount of stress on the enviroment and can lead to problems in the near future. Because of these problems, many enviomental agencies have started regulating car usage to try to keep the enviroment safe. Some of the ways they are doing this include promoting ""car reduced"" communities, which rely more on public transportation serving the suburbs than personal transportation. This helps to cut down on traffic and in turn the amount of emissions produced by cars on the road. Another way to prevent this is to ban the act of driving all together. Paris has done this in the past to combat the amount of smog accumulating in their city by banning the driving of certain license plate numbers which reduced the amount of traffic and emissions.

Car free cities are also very popular. an example of this is Bogota, Columbia. They have had cars banned for the last three years, minus buses and taxis. The goal of this project was to promote alternate means of transportation and reduce smog. This has created over 118 miles in bicycle paths as well as broad smooth sidewalks. The amount has traffic has also been cut in half during rush-hour thanks to new restrictions. New retaurants and upscale shopping has also come up all around the area. The amount of smag has also been reduced significantly and air quality has made a huge jump.

Overall, the age of the  car is coming to an end, but it is making our life better and easier. Hopefully these new restrictions and ideas will help us to reduce smog, cut down on traffic and produce a better, more stress-free, lifestyle. Then, maybe we can all become ""Urban /k/ommandos"" someday. The term ""Urban /k/ommando"" is trademark of the /k/ Branch of 4Chan. org and is not to be used by any parties who do not assume the responsibilities of carrying this title.             ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

As towns such as Vauban and Paris participate in car free days, they greatly reduce the amount of pollution that would have become that day. their hard work and enthusiasm even encouraged other cities and parts of the country to join. our pollution rate is much to high for the only planet and space we can live on. increasing it daily will only hurt us and be fatal in the long run.

Death rates caused by cars is another reason to have a few days off from them. Fatalaties caused in accidents, hit and runs, and wrecks happen multiple times daily. a few days or even just one of no/reduced car usage could save the lives of many.

money costs are a large complaint in our society today, especially money involving cars. from the cost of the car itself to the dollars to per gallon used every week, nobody likes to spend that much money on their vehicle. well we wouldnt have to as often if we did have dayswhere cars were fined if used.

Three advantages of limiting car usage are less pollution,more time and healty life,and it improves safety.

To begin with cars have givin us both advantages like faster traveling time but they have also given us disadvantages. Most of us can agree that cars have caused some of the pollution that we have now. The cold nights and warm days have caused th car emissions to be traped in our atomsphere. In Paris,one of the biggest capital has a big amount of cars that nearly had a new record of pollution. Acording to

Elisabeth Rosenthal, from the new york times ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.""

Research has also found out that Paris have more smog then any other European capitals. After not using their cars the smog quickly reduce. In the capital of France congestion was 60 percent down after five-days of being unable to use their cars.

Another thing that is also giving us a more healty live and more time.

""Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"" according to Andrew Selsky, from the seattle times.

A businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""

It's a Good opportuinty to take away stress and low air pollution.""

Parks and sports centers are now starting to get bigger and appear more through the city. More people have also started using the sidewalks or get on a bicycle. Malls are now closer, leaving you able to walk to it. You can now hear the swishs of bicycles and children talking instead of the sounds of cars.

Last of all,it improves safety of many people. Since there are less cars on the street there are less chances of car crashes. Parents can know be less worried about their child being run over. Car crashes caused by drunk drivers are also less liklely to happen. People now take public transportations or car-pool with friends making it more safer.

In conclusion, car have been around for a long time. They have givin us advantages and disadvantages. There are many advantages towards limiting car usage. Three of these reasons are less pollution,more time and healty life,and it improves safety.                                ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
E4F9E557F03B,"Every day more and more people are surrounded by a toxic smog. This is caused by burning fossil fuels like gasoline, oil, and natural gasses. One of the main reasons toxic smog comes up is because of the mass amounts of vehicles on the road. Organizations and governments from around the word are trying to find a solution to our pollution problem. But when you think about it a car free world wouldnt be all that bad.

There are many pros for limiting car use. imagine breathing in the fresh air and seeing the beutiful skys above smog free, governments from around the world already see this dream and they want to make it into a reality. ""after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" said Robert Duffer author of the article Paris bans driving due to smog. Cities around the world are trying to find new ways to reduce pollution from massive cities. Its a wonderful idea especialy since Paris rivaled Beijing China possibly the most polluted place in the world.

But when we get rid of all of the cars then what will be our means of transportation new ideas have scattered across the globe. Many countries are starting to rely on trains to move their citizens from one place to another and with revolutionary technology trains are now faster than ever. How many parking lots are in your city? thats another thing without parking lots cities wil be more open and more stores and super markets will take their place. More and more countries start to relize that reducing vehicle emissions will make the quality of life in their city higher and cleaner and it apears that the ideas are taking action ""a program that's set to spread toother countries, millions of columbians hiked, biked, and skated or took buses to work during a car-free day"". said Andrew Selsky author of Car-free day spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Cities are now taking action and are helping the enviorment by starting days where no cars are allowed. this is one example of how many countries are going green and helping the enviorment.

With plenty of ways of reducing gas emissions the world will soon take a turn for the best being able to reduce pollution and make the overall populatin happy. more and more means of transportation pop up every day so just wait and you will see an impact on your comuntiy as well. in the mean time hop on you bike and go green the change starts with you.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

In the story ""

Paris bans driving due to smog""

talks about how after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It says that on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day, I think that this should happen all around the world, so the world can be a better palce to live in. Here is a fact form the stroy, "" Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had a 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London"". The 3rd stroy was about how in Bogota, Comlombia they do a car-free day, now that should be done here in the U.S.. It says that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during car-free day, that the streets of the captial city eerily devoid of traffic jams, and that the rain has not stopped people from participating.

The last stroy talks about how the car culture is coming to an end, but i really hope not and i think not. It is here ,in the U.S., the birthpalce of the Model T, a classic car that i love and i would hope so that a lot of more people do too; the home of Detroit, what i know is that they make cars up there; tha place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally"", I do not know what that is but it does sound important.

The car will enither be gone or be impovred some how, the fliying car maybe, but in till that happens, because i live in now, the car is what we have, i know that it's bad for the air, so instead of not using the car we can make it better, better for the world.

9F9A56C3517E,"Cars are magnificent machines. They allows to travel in much quicker ways than just walking or taking the bus, but have you ever thought about what these machines are doing to our environment? Although you may not think of it, cars create alot of smog, daily. ""Passenger cars are  responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the Unted States"" (source 1: paragraph 5). While this may not seem like a big deal, smog can actually kill you if too much is inhaled. So what do we do to prevent this?

Vauban, Germany, A place you've probably never heard of before. It's a place for more upscale residents. The great thing about it is that they have given up cars for good. ""70 percent of Vauban's familes do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" (source 1: paragraph 3). Paris has also decided to jump on this bandwagon, but in a way a little different than Germany's. They have accumulated so much smog that they started giving out fines for those driving on certain days in order to let the environment naturally clear out all the smog. ""On monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" (source 2: paragraph 11). Along with Paris and Germany, Columbia has created a day deticated to no driving. It is called the ""Day Without Cars"" and citizens of this area are not aloud to drive on this day(source 3: paragraph 21). This event spread throughout Columbia and is now spreading throughout the world.

So why is all this happening and how are people taking the step to prevent smog? ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" (source 4: paragraph 41). What are possible factors of this? ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van serices for getting to work."" (source 4: paragraph 35). As The End of Car Culture tells us, alot more young people are becoming less and less interested in cars due to cellphones. Also it is shown us that the denser the area is with cars, the more people have chosen to take bicycles to work or even just walk because they don't want to deal with the traffic.

Many people have taken the step to encourage a healthier environment without cars. Some banned driving for good, some created a holiday dedicated to no driving for a day, and some just stopped it for a while by handing out fines. There are many alternate ways of transportation such as walking and biking, but are you willing take the step, to give up cars, and to change you lifestyle for the better, or will you continue to hurt the environment by driving and contributing to the smog? Will you join the few that have made the change or continue following everyone else? A world without cars is a better one. One with less smog and less aggrevation. A happier place, more peaceful and relaxing. Your choice, your life, pick a side, and choose wisely.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

'In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'

,

'Paris bans driving dye to smog'

, and

'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota'

, there are many advantages that can come with the limiting of car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal mentions many of these in her article about Vauban, Germany. One woman she quoted in the third paragraph, Heidrun Walter, says ""

When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.

"" Not everyone may feel less tense after getting rid of their car, but it would definitely be a great thing. Another advatage that came with less car usage in Vauban that Rosenthal mentions in her article, is that stores started getting built about a walk away instead of in malls miles away. This is obviously an amazing point because everyone still has needs they must buy or tend to and it's much better if the places they buy the things they need are in walking distance because no one would need to use distance as an excuse to use their car.

In the fifth paragraph of Duffer's article, he makes sure to mention that car traffic was down 60% in Paris after they decided to enforce a partial ban on driving to also clear the air. If we limit car usage, their would be way less traffic, which means less time sitting in our cars aggravated about the fact that we're stuck and need to get to school or work soon or else we'll be late.

In the third article, which is written by Andrew Selsky he reports that in Bogota on their ""

car-free day

"" there was little to no traffic, and the annual event has reduced smog. In the fifth paragraph, he quoted a businessman named Carlos Arturo Plaza. Carlos says that the event is ""

a good oppurtinity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

"" The day without cars inspires you to find alternative transportation methods, which can be as simple as walking or even riding a bike which are both really healthy and great ways to get your excersise in! Selsky also notes that the day without cars has sparked the construction of more bicycle paths, bigger, nicer sidewalks and more parks and sports centers have popped up around the city. Clearly in Bogota they are taking advantage of keeping their air healthy by trying to inspire their residents to be and stay healthy as well.

To begin with, there are thousands of cars in the world and it keeps on increasing, we'll have less traffic is we start to limit car usage. This is clear in source 3, it says ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This shows that people can use other ways to transport to one play to another, they wont have to use a car and there will be no taffic any where. Therefore, its better to have no traffic involved you'll get to places faster then usaully.

Additionally, people stress alot over things and walking can help you stress less. In source 3, it says ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution."" This says this can benefit for you so yould't have to overthink things. Therefore, walking to your jobs, school, stores and any where you want to good can help you release stress.

Moreover, less teens will be getting license so there will be less car accidents.

This is clear in source 4, ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."" This means that the less teens will get inyo car accidents which means the growth population will be increasing not decreasing. Therefore, the less teens get license the less accidents occurs.

In conclusin, there are many benefits in limiting car usage. Less pollution, no more traffic, less stress, and less teens will get their license. The more we do this the more we get use to it so we wont complain about anything. I urge you to stop using your car less because it will help you in some way.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

This dramatic change has been a eye opener to many communities in different countries all over the world. It has really helped with the enviroment and brought a postive impact on communities in various ways.

To begin, the limiting of car usage has brought out a positive result in the environment. According to the excerpt from ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Due to the partial driving ban, the smog was able to be cleared sooner than later. Some may claim an agrument of cars being very useful and it helps get from destination to destination in a resonable amount of time. Although that may be reasonable, a testimomony from a businessman in Bogota explains that it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

To continue on, the limiting of car usage has also brought a positive impact many communties in different countries. This new adjustment has created a domino effect as many countries take on the challenge. In the excerpt from ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", author Andrew Selsky explains that parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.

According to the excerpt, Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"".

One citizen said ""when i had a car i was always so tense  im so much happier this way"". So clearly the the reason why the citizens enjoy not having a car was maybe because, they didnt have to worry about all the expences like gas and car insurance to take care of a car.

Another reason why its good to limit the use of cars is because of the nasty Co2  gas that come out of the of the muffler and polluts the air. Car pollution became so bad that the city of paris put a partial ban on driving to clear the the air of the city. By doing this the air pollution ""was down by 60"" witch the artical states in paragraph 14. This is a good  thing becase france has a higher pollution rate than other european citys.

BCEBC0EB9F21,"America's love of cars may soon be spiraling down. With America's car culture seemingly coming to an end, there will be more alternative ways to get to work, school, shopping districts, and etc. As the years come and go by quickly, Americans are buying less cars and obtaining fewer licenses for themselves. The advantages we can recieve by limiting our car usage is that it takes away stress, lowers air pollution, and benefits daily businesses.

First, Limiting car usage takes away stress. As businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza states:""It's a good opportunity to take away stress...""  People who no longer own a car will not have to worry as much about their car. Such as the price of gas rising, car payments, and insurance payments. These type of payments every month often put a big dent in a person's wallet. If we take up to the oppurtunity of limiting our car usage, we really won't have to worry about car payments anymore. Plus, being outside in the environment will certainly reduce stress levels almost completely, because we are interacting with others that are waliking and enjoying the the environment outside.

In addition to, taking away stress. Limiting car usage will result in lower air pollution. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" If we limit car usage, the levels of air pollution will dramatically decrease resulting in cleaner air and a healthy environment for us to live in. If we continue to use cars, we are further damaging the air that we breathe everyday and causing people to damage their lungs. Pollution often has chemicals that can harm our breathing and sometimes our lungs. As Americans it is our responsibility to take care of the earth and we are not doing so by constently using our cars.

Lastly, limiting car usage benefits daily businesses. Selsky staes: ""Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throughout the city; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up. If we rely on walking to stores, etc. that are only a block away, it will surely increase the revunue of restaurants and shopping districts. Since the stores are so close to home, we'll be more willing to enter the store and/or restaurant. Increasing businesses revunue also helps the economy, which we desperately need.

In conclusion, these advantages that we have gone over in the essay will greatly impact the future of America. Such as,  taking away stress from former car owners, lowering the air pollution so we have a cleaner air to breathe, and beneifiting our daily businesses to increase revunue and better our economy. If we all limit car usage and follow the advantages listed, it will result in a better earth for us to live in.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
8E440582BF2B,"In our world, air pollution is a huge problem. Most air pollution stems from motor vehicles. People don't usually tend to think that driving is hurting the Earth, but that is exactly what it is doing. Smog is a big issue in cities like New York and Paris. Not only is it unsafe for the environment, but it is also unhealthy for humans.

Big cities have recently started doing ""Car-Free"" days where no one is allowed to drive. If a person does drive, they will get fined. City officials are doing this in an attempt to cut back on the air pollution and smog that cars cause. In a sense, they are saving the world that we live in. In the third article, Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Another wonderful thing about limiting car use is this: It saves money. Gasoline is so expensive today. It is stressful to have to pay so much money for it. The prices constantly fluctuate and it's hard to keep up with. Yes, public transportation costs money. But it doesn't cost nearly as much as it would to fill up your whole gas tank.

A big problem in America is obesity. I think that this is partially because nobody ever needs to get up and really walk anywhere. Our car keys are at our fingertips and since we can so easily drive, we see no reason in travelling anywhere close in any other way. I believe that obesity in America would be greatly reduced if car use was limited. People would be out walking more and they would be engaging in more physical activity than ever before. It can do nothing but good for all of us.

I understand that some people label limiting car usage as ""unnatural"", but I don't think those people really consider all of the goodness in it. There are many advantages in not being so reliant on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not just the latest fad, but a new way of protecting the Earth and it's people. It is a way to keep the environment clean and functioning properly, as it should be. It is a way to make humans healthier and happier. I honestly believe that being less reliant on cars is a great thing, and I believe that it is the direction in which we need to go.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

limiting on car usage

"" seems to be a very aggravating phrase for an entire population of people who have become so dependent on it. It's a concept that we can't take in. We Americans use our cars for a personal use daily. We are so accustomed to our cars that we just use it to perform simple tasks that we could use our legs that were given to us, for free, to cross the street. When the average person says that they would like to go to the market across the street, probably about 70%, don't even think about the fact that we could just simply walk there. Cars are endarging our environment and our health. Cars create so much pollution and is a health-risk. Our cars seem to be as important as one of our limbs. Something you could not bare to live without. Now here are some of the reasons why.

To begin with, cars are polluting our atmosphere. Have you ever heard of the ""green house effect""? It's endangering our Earth, by polluting it, which is contributing to Global Warming. Cars are something we shouldn't always rely on. We have to get accustomed to the way of the pioneers. We all just need to limit the amount of times we use our cars and think, ""hmm.. do i really need to use my car right now? Can't i just use my two working legs to get to where i want to go, which is right down the block."" In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", paragraph 5; lines 6-9, the article states that, and i quote, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas of the United States."" Which is a whole lot of damage we are enflicting our own envirnment that we need to thrive on and live off. In reality, cars are overrated. We don't always need it, so we shouldn't always use it.

In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", paragraph 12; lines 1-3, it states, ""congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after 5-days of intensifying smog."" Imagine all of that pollution on this earth if we kept using our cars, which are slowly killing us.

Not only do cars endanger our environment, but it also creates a huge health-risk factor.

Cars can make us become lazy. We can use our cars so much to the point where we could  get accustomed to cars and grow tired and weary of using our legs. We may as well just live in a car. Cars could also create lots of stress. In artcile ""Car-free day is spinning a big hit in Bogota."", paragraph 5; lines 1-2, the author interviews someone and that person claims that, "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air-pollution.""

In Conclusion, we together as a whole should limit our car usage to cut back on pollution. We should all learn to be in touch with our environment and to just walk around in our clean, eco-friendly air. If we cut back, we wouldn't have to be worried about Global Warming anymore. We would all be closer, one step at a time.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

There's a revolution that stands before us in the form of a new lifestyle: Car-free living. Taking the globe by storm this global phenomenon presents us with a more efficient enviornment, a huge drop in car accident tragedies, and a more functionable lifestyle.

First and foremost, the given: a better enviornment. Air pollution is a global issue that has become very previlant in our society today. In places such as Paris, France, extremes as far as fines for those who drive around in cars are enforced as a way to fight it's overly dense smog. Also, the president of the United States, Barrack Obama, has set a goal to curb the greenhouse gas emissions in the country. When government iniative are set to such its obvious that it's becoming an issue. If everyone begins to enforce a car free lifesyle then the world will reach a tremendous turning point and will be able to preserve our planet for the future generations.

Furthermore, it is known that car accidents are a common occuring issue whether it be small or deadly. Intoxicated or sober accidents can be just as bad. There will be no more bikers or pedestrians being hit and need to hitch hike will no longer be an issue as well. If we remove cars form our lives then we get the advantage of putting our society in a more safe way to transport.

Finally, car free lving will make us a more functionable lifestyle. The need of having to go so far for simple things will no longer be an issue due to the fact that everything that would be essential would be easier and closer to assess. People would begin walking more which would very much so decrease the obesity rates in many places. Also the expanison of public transportation will mean that people are more likely to have a more direct stop near the places they go.

In sumation, living car-lessly is a life lived less carelessly. It brings a coupious amount of advantages which means that everyone will have a safer, more funcitonable, and efficient lifestyle.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
1EB2AB9D50B1,"Did you ever wonder if limiting car usage is a good idea?

Limiting car usage can be a good idea in some ways. Some ways limiting car usage could be a good idea is by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, clearing the air of pollution, saving time, conserving rescources, and improving safety.

To start off, limiting car usage can be good in many ways. For example, by limiting car usage we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. According to Source 1:

In

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , paragraph 5 says that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. That is alot. With that amount of greenhouse gas gone, the air can be cleaner.

In addition, limiting car usage can also be a good idea for clearing the air from smog and pollution. For example, in Source 2:

Paris bans driving due to smog , a law was enforced to help clear the smog and pollution. On Mondays, people with even numbered licence plates could not drive. If they decided to drive they were given a fine of 31 dollars. This ban helped clear congestion by 60 percent in the capital of France.

Thirdly, the limiting of car usage could conserve rescources. If people do not drive we could save gas and oil to use it for something other than cars. People would also save money by not having to by gas or oil.

To conclude, limiting car usage could be good in many ways. If we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clear the air of smog and pollution, or even conserve our rescources, we should limit our car usage.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
84D540E7908D,"Throughout time, pollution has been known to be a huge environmental problem. The excessive amount of individual car owners driving down streets is in no way helping this issue. Efforts to diminish the number of cars we see on our roads have been taking place in order to help the environment and therefore citizens as well.

It is no news that passenger cars are harmful to the environment. They release gases that pollute the air we breathe affecting not only us but the environment as a whole. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States (Source 1). This realization has led to the promotion of ""car-reduced"" communites by the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (Source 1). But the problem is more widespread than that. Paris has acknowledged the importance of this issue after witnessing smog that rivaled Beijing, China, known as one of the most polluted cities in the world (Source 2). Paris's solution was to enforce a driving ban in order to help clear its air. Due to this ban, congestion was down 60 percent shortly after the intensifying smog (Source 2). It is a known fact that transportation is America's second largest source of emissions, therefore, limiting passenger car usage can greatly benefit the environment as well as citizens' everyday lives.

Limiting car usage has not only proven to be helpful towards the environment but towards citizens as well. With a decrease in car usage comes new benefits not just to individual citizens but to communities. Less cars means less time in irritating traffic. Usually, car traffic and traffic jams leads to huge amounts of stress. This is because the idea of not getting to work is stressful; not getting to work means losing money. Losing money adds even more stress. But when limiting car usage, losing money is not an issue one has to think about. Carlos Arturo Plaza agrees by stating that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Source 3). Rush-hour restrictions and other efforts towards limiting car usage have cut traffic making it easier for citizens to get to their jobs (Source 4). Those who choose other forms of transportation that are less harmful to the environment have even less of a problem and appear to be much happier. Heldrun Walter states that when she had a car she was always tense but now she is much happier (Source 1). The evidence has proven that limiting car usage is benefical to not only the environment but to citizens' daily life as well.

Keeping a clean environment is something of major importance. If one does not take care of the environment there will seize to be a healthy environment in which to live in. Limiting car usage is a big step when it comes to keeping the environment free of pollution. Not only is it beneficial to the environment but it helps citizens live a much happier life lessening the causes of stress. Limiting car usage helps the air needed to breathe, the money coming into your pockets, and one's overall happiness.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
9D46E8F0C62A,"In Vauban Germany, the people in the suburbs have stopped driving. Parking or housing a car predominately prohibited and the only vehicle you'd see is the tram that take citizens from the edge of the community or to downtown Freiburg. You can own a car, but the parking space is incredibly limited, sometimes even expensive.

The residents aren't complaining. 57% of the population even had sold their car to live in Vauban, one woman even stating she felt less tense without a vehicle.

The growing trend of reducing automotive use in suburban lifestyles is a role in a movement known as ""smart planning."" Cars are often heavily populated in the suburbs, which hinders the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions, as up to 50% of greenhouse gas emissions in the US come from cars.

Many of the world is now slowly following Vauban's steps with actions like reducing the size of suburbs and and giving its residents more access to public transportation. Rather than creating distant malls along highways, stores are being placed on a main street that's a walk away.

In Paris, after dealing with a nearly record-high amount of smog, a driving ban was enforced to reduce and/or clear out the pollution. Public transit was free and the smog managed to clear enough that cars with odd-numbered plates were allowed to be put in use again.

Bogota, California also took part in a day without passenger vehicles, with only buses and taxis in commision. On Day Without Cars, 7 million people rode bikes, skated, hiked, or took a bus to their job. It's believed to help reduce pollution and reduce stress. Thanks to the day, parks and sport centers have appeared, sidewalks made smoother and broadened, rush-hour rules designed to cute traffic, and plenty of new shops and dining places within short distance.

Recents studies also appear reveal a decrease in car purchases as time passes, raising the question of America's interest in automotives and driving. As of 2013, an average person drove 9% below the peak, identical to where is was in 1995. While the price of cars is a factor taken into consideration, the decrease hopefully hints to a more permanent drop in car use.

With this comes a benificial lessen of carbon emmissions, conserve resources and improve safety. Only time will tell where it will go from here.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent

63678A1DF932,"Driving at times can be a really big issue to deal with. There are so many thing that can go wrong, a crash, then increase in insurence, you might even get your license taken away after that. When you don't drive, the world is an open book just waiting to be read. Walking or riding bikes can relieve stress and make you more fit and in shape. The gasses that come from cars are just aweful for the environment, and there would be such a largly reduced number in traffic jams if pleople would just get off the road. Once your on the road, anything can happen. It's dangerous, i sometimes even wonder if i really want a license.

When you drive there are so many traffic jams. The idea of never having to worry about traffic again is intriguing. Why worry about having to rush through traffic just to get to work on time, when instead you can simply manage your time correctly and walk at the pace you are comfortable with. Traffic jams cause accidents that put peoples lives at risk. In the article, ''Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Botoga'' by Andrew Selsky, he states, ''...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams''. The car-free day in Colombia is working to perfection to promote alternative transportation, i don't see why we dont have this in the United States.

Drivig causes stress and tension and that's never good. A stressed driver is a dangerous driver, when you're stressed you become more careless and less aware of your surroundings and that is very dangerous as a driver it leads to wreckless driving and accidents. Being without a car relieves this stress for many people. In the article, ''In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars'' by Elisabeth Rosenthal, a quote from the article states, ''When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,'' said Heidrun Walter. This shows that cars are a lot to handle and that most people just believe it is too much stress for one person to deal with.

The smog and pollution caused by all the cars that are on the road these days is another reason why it is best to stay off the road. In the article, ''Paris bans driving due to smog'' by Robert Duffer, he says, ''[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world''. The cities ban on cars on the road shows a serious concern in the saftey of the people because of all the smog that driving has caused.

Some people might argue that cars would be faster, but if you take a car you are going to be mor at risk of an accident, you're going to be polluting the air, and you'll only be stressing yourself out in the process. I strongly suggest that America does something to change our ways, because if we don't, we'll end up like Beijing and Paris with an extremly high pollution rate.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
7EC34F21069A,"As the years go by,  so does the evolution of automobiles and the effect it carries in our environment. Technology changes the way we move and interact with one another, some for the better and others for the worst. Limiting car usage will help individuals carry themselves in their environment because it will cause less pollution and less accidents.

Earth's atmosphere is slowly starting to change due to the fact that chemicals and gases are being released from your very own car. As Amercia's population increases so do the risk of the the greenhouse gases, resulting in global warmming and the lost of some habbitats. ""If the pattern persists .... it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"",(Rosenthal 34). Stopping the usage of cars in our society will help protect not only ourselves but also the lives of those with whom you share with.

Imagine lossing your loved one in a car accident and never hearing from her or him again. As Amercia's population starts to increase so those it's migration stream, resulting in manufactoring and labor cost. If more cars are being released into our living, the lives of those in which we care will soon never be seen again. Limiting the usage of cars with help keep our enviromnet/society accident free and see those familar faces which we saw as we grew up. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city, uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, soomth sidewalks, rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic, and new restuarants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"",(Selsky 28). A day without car will help the lives of many espically those around you.

When technology changes so does our ideas and perspective on our surroundings. Congestion causes stress and reduces the chance of a clear sky. Car usage changes the lives of many as well as impacts in what we care about and what we don't care about. Limiting car usage will help individuals carry themselves in their environment because it will cause less pollution and less accidents.                    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Other's are trying to stop car pollution and limet the usage of them. Cars cause alot of smog wich then goes into the air and pollutes it. This is very bad, especially for our health. Were the one that breathe this air in and if its polluted we may become sick. It is also a good stress releiver since you dont have to be stuck in trafic or having to hear the car honk all day.

In source 1 ""German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" it talk abou how the people in Vauban, Germany do not use cars. Cars are allowed but people chose too not use them. 70 percent of Vauban's families to not own a car and some have even sold there to move there. Heidrum Walter said that when she had a car she was always tense and is more happier know that she dosen't own one. Vauban may be the most city in low-car suburban other part of the world are taking this as an example and trying it out to. More and more places around the world are making stores more near by or on a main street, rather than having them in a shopping center with a highway distant.

Parin,France is the city that has the most smog out of all cities in Europe. This means that the pollution rate is higher. Thats why acording to source 2 ,Paris enforeced a partial driving ban to help clear the air in the city. Citizens were ordered to leave there vehicles at home or pay a fine of $31. But this did not stop people from using cars almost 4,000 drivers were fined after this ban was enforced. The reason Paris had for doing this is because after five days of intensive smog the congestion was down by 60 percent. By enforcing this ban Paris was able to clear out the smog in 3 days and be back to normal on Tuesday.

I know that people may not want to give up using there cars, yes is an easier way to travel and get places faster. There right, but it would be better for the world and ourself if we could reduce the usage of cars not just in our cities but all over the world. Just how in Bogoa, Columbia they have car free days. People who live there have a car free day wich mean they biked, walked or took buses to all of the destenations they had that day. Bogota had been doing this for three consecutive years and the goal is to promote alternativ etransportation and reduce smog. Some people who live there say that by doing these they relieved stress. By Bogota doing this they have parks and sports centers, uneven sidewalks have been taking away and replaced with smooth sidewalks.

In the United States more and more people are buying less cars and fewer people get there licens as the years go by. Even though americans are know for ther big love on carr ,that seems to be reducing. This is very beneficial for carbon emmissions and the environment. People like Mimi Sheller a sociology professor at Drexel University researched different resources and said that the Internet makes telecommuting possible and we don't have to drive to a friend house to see them or talk to themm we can just use technology to do that. Also the percentage of people getting there license has chaged. People are finding ways to either walk, take public transportatio, or have somone cal-pool them ,rather than diving a car themselfs.

In conclusion limiting car usage is getting bigger and bigger as the years go by. We should all be helping this to make it happen all over the world. It helps with pollution problems, its great for your health and it helps relevied stress.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

Their should definitley be a limiting of car usage because their would be less car accidents , people would be able to spend less money on cars and we would have less air pollution. Also having a car can cause a lot of stress or tension for people.

Obviously we're having a lot of problems with money in this world , if we limit car usage that would really help is us out a lot. See as it states in source one paragraph two '' A car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars , along with a home.'' With those forty thousand dollars you can do a lot to help the world . It aslo says that fifty seven percent of the people who live in a suburban area sold their cars just move where they live at now. Who needs a car when you can just walk ''stores are placed a walk away, on a main street rather than the malls along some distant highway. ''source one paragraph 6.

Pollution is destroying our world and we need to help stop it, so here's an idea lets ban driving due to smog says Paris. Their was an enforced partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Do you agree with that? well I do and here's why . Paris has more smog than other European capitals so if they don't stop the smog it's going to be horrific for their city. Source three paragraph twenty one '' the goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.'''Not having cars for one day is brilliant idea because is an improvement to the city of Bogota.

Their is a lot of disruptions an accidents going on because of cars mainly because of the traffic so if their was less cars it would be more peaceful. Usually when there's traffic you hear a lot honking and there's a lot fines for that. The fines are very expensive to pay so you're wasting a lot of money. Also when people are honking they don't realize that other people are sleeping . Everyone needs sleep , some people can't sleep through everything so all it takes is one honk and bam they're awake. Sleeping is really needed in your life imagine notgetting enough sleep because of traffic well yeah that would suck an a lot of people already go through that .

So in conclusion what I'm saying is car usage should definitly be limited at least in some countries or states. Money is a really big problem we have that needs to be solved and this is a great way. People living in a surburan area have to pay more just for extra parking places. Air pollution is very bad for the world with les cars that will stop as well.

Cars produce smog which goes up in to he air and is bassically what  created the greenhouse affect.

When people use cars they hardly dont ever think about what is actually happening while they use it, mostly whats thought about is how fast they are going or how much time they have left to get where they are going. When driving a car smog is released from the tail pipe and usually donsnt affect any on directly unless they are really close to it, but even then it is a momment of discnomfert nothing perminent. what most peoiple dont realize is that when smog is released from the car it gose directly up into our atmosphere. when there is an abundance of smog it acumulates creating a green house affect. what is needed to stop that is to stop driving ingeneral but scincde that cat be done do as paris has done and have sertain laws that prevent most people to drive on some day ""On monday motorist with even numbered license plates were to suffer a 22 euro fine then the same would apply to the odd numberd plates the next day."" this would make for people to stop driving so much ang just go for a walk to their location if it isnt too far.

Walking isnt as bad as most people would probably think it to be. Some people already do it on a normal basis. Some people could argue that the weather is to gloomy or its raining and they dont want to get wet. As the Mayor of bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped me from participating."" More states should have a day with out cars like Bogota dose and have ""The day with out cars is part of an improvement"" and just like that as Bogota has done ""parks and sports centers will bloom"", ""New restaurants and upscale shopping districs will be cropped up.""

Americans without even realizing it have stopped driving. We have bought less cars and drivers licenses as each year gose buy. Which shows that there is a little bit of care towards the sitiation happening all around the world. Usually americans were the ones to be mostly using their cars but as the article states. ""Americans love affar with their cars have began cooling down."" Even thought the cars are still being used they are used much less than before.

Most of the members of the capital seem to be in favor of the car-free day, the support for a day similar to this in other countries is rising to. The main problem for getting rid of private vehicals is that many cities cannot accomplish this kind of transportation. There are many small towns in America that do not have the ability to walk or bike across the long distances from the home to the downtown area. America depends on agriculture exports, so if we all convert to city life America wont have many exports left.

From Germany, to France, to Columbia, to the United States, everybody is trying to start drving less for a cleaner, happier world. Countries' governments everywhere are trying to get people off the roads and start biking, walking, or using public transportation instead. As the people in these countries have learned, there are many advantages to giving up drving cars, if even only for a few days rather than their entire lives.

The main advantage is a cleaner planet. Emissions that cars release play a large role in the world's air pollution. Carbon emissions create smog that makes the sky grey, damages our lungs, and harms the plants that give us clean air. Due to carbon emissions from cars, Paris once had as much smog as ""Beijjing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (Source 2). If we start driving less cars it will have really beneficial implications for the environment, especially ""... since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (Source 4). Imagine what positive effects banning cars would have on the population's and world's health.

One positive effect would be a lot less stress. Driving is a dangerous activity where you are constantly putting yourself at risk. Many people realize this and tend to be scared of driving or are constantly nervous when they drive. Rushing to drive to work on time also creates negative stress. Says German media trainer and mother, Heidrun Walter, of no longer owning a car, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Daily long commutes are also a large determining factor in someone's mood. Some people have to drive for hours a day just to get to their already stressful job and then again when they go back home. This creates for a very unhappy society. Now there are a couple of good things that come from a society that is no longer obsessed with car culture. One thing is that ""the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends"" (Source 4). This lessens the need have a car to take you to distant places. With the banning or lessening use of personal vehicles cities and towns are being rebuilt. ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1). This has encouraged healthier and cheaper modes of transportation such as walking, skating, bicycling, and public transportation such as buses.

Fewer cars and this rebuilding of cities saves you money and commute time. Just think about all those rising gas prices. You don't need to pay tolls when you walk, or get fined when you run too fast. Prices for parking spots and passing tolls are going up anyway. It's an easier and cheaper alternative to just walk or bike somewhere. Public transportation like buses and subways cost a lot less too. Studies have found that fewer people are buying cars and getting their licenses; it's for a reason.

Lastly, not only are leaders across the globe joining in on the idea of life without cars, but so are car-selling companies. ""Companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themeselves ""mobility"" companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"" (Source 4). Even Bill Ford, executive chariman of the Ford Motor Company proposed a business plan in which ""personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable."" Ford suggested becoming partners with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" (Source 4).

So next time you think about buying a new car or driving to work all buy yourself, try to rethink your actions and imagine the effect it will have on not only you, but everyone around you. Maybe you can bike to work if it's not that far, take the bus instead, carpool with some coworkers. The planet and future generations will thank you if you just limit your car usage, even a little bit at a time.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

1232E9091138,"Since the rise of suburbs nationally and globally, car culture has been an important component of our history and of the typical human experience. Every teenager anticipates the excitement and freedom of a driver's license, our country is ""the birthplace of the Model T"" and ""the home of Detroit,"" and mothers across the globe rely on SUVs and station wagons to haul their children to and from school, soccer practice, Sunday mass, and the like (Source 4). In recent years, however, there is a growing trend of limited car usage around the world as countries promote vehicle-free neighborhoods and as in nations like the USA, ""there has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year olds getting a license,"" (Source 4). This trend, while seemingly alarming in our technology-dependent universe, offers several advantages, from a better environment to healthier citizens and communities, and encouraging and promoting this pattern may just be as revolutionary for the planet as the introduction of the first car over a century ago.

From France to Colombia, first of all, governments have been encouraging limited car usage as a means to better the environment through the reduction of toxic emissions into our atmosphere - after all, ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States,"" (source 1). As debates have run rampant around the world about global warming and air pollution, several nations have taken initiative and experimented with the effects of this idea. In the district of Vauban, Germany, for instance, ""street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden,"" and as a result of expensive parking spots for those who do choose to operate their vehicles - upwards of $40,000 a pop - ""70% of Vauban's families do not own cars,"" (Source 1). Limited car usage and public transportation is alternatively being promoted in Germany and elsewhere as an attempt to live our day-to-day lives in a way that is healthier for ourselves and the planet. France is one such example - in Paris, for instance, ""one of the most polluted cities in the world,"" ""near-record pollution""  led officials to impose a driving ban to help clear the air, and almost 4,000 were ticketed with a $31 fine as a result of not following orders (Source 2). Free public transit was offered, and a result of the actions of the ruling party, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog,"" (Source 2). Likewise, Bogota, Colombia annually hosts a program known as the Day Without Cars that has attracted interest from neighboring countries and cities and provides an opportunity to ""take away stress and lower air pollution,"" according to businessman Carlos Arturo, who spent the day bicycling with his wife (source 3). Globally, limiting car usage has resulted in exciting changes for not only the environment, but, surprisingly, public health as well.

The obesity crisis and lack of healthy social interactions, secondly, both are looming global issues due the rise of supersized fast food and innovations in social media and the Internet, and this trend of limited car usage serves as an unseen, advantageous remedy by promoting healthier people and communities. Without cars, people must find alternative forms of transportation, and in Bogota, for example, during the Day Without Cars, ""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated...to work,"" and since this campaign began in the mid-1990s, it has seen ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" and has resulted in parks, sports centers, and broad sidewalks; considerably less traffic; and the emergence of ""new restaurants and upscale shopping districts,"" (Source 3). A mother of two in Vauban, Germany, Heidrun, Walter, claims that, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1). Alternative forms of transportation also allow for increased social interaction - walking with your neighbor on the way to work, your kids interacting while en route to school, or striking up a conversation with a stranger on a public bus or tram are all examples of making connections with others that do wonders for our mental and social health.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

So I think i'll help beta test this essay writing test that SCHOOL_NAME was ""randomly selected"" for, but this prompt given with these writing selections, doesn't make any sense unless you wish a dull and dry essay with just regurgitated facts from the writing selections. So, here goes something.

In the state of STATE_NAME students from 3rd grade and up are all familiar with the infamous TEST_NAME, it was what was required for so many years and what we've all gotten used to. Once I personally hit middle school, we had midterms and finals for only one year, the following year they were removed and we were given interm exams for every quater to determine how much we were absorbing in the classroom. We were graded on these fairly, (not very heavily; 3 grades at the max.)

Up until about 8th grade I had never heard of an EOC, it was first introduced to me in my U.S history class. We took a test that our teacher had formulated and we all studied for weeks. I figured this would become apart of my highschool life, and I wasn't wrong; 9th grade Geometry EOC, and a Biology EOC. It was dreadful, (since it was taken on a computer in a freezing computer lab,) but we all survived because thankfully it was only for those two classes. After those two weeks of testing for the entire school it was fun and games and preperation for the challenges that were to come in our next year of schooling; for me this would be my relaxing yet exciting sophmore year.

Sophmore year had been going just fine up until one day in my french class we were informed that this year starting as early as January we would be tested with an EOC FOR EVERY CLASS! Students were confused and a bit outraged at this new information. We asked hundreds of questions. ""What will they be on?"" ""Is the district making them?"" ""Are you serious!?"" Our teacher,(well informed on what had seemed to be everything,) knew of our fate to come; five months of overall testing occuring through our hallowed halls. We were baffled that classes like P.E, Art, Culinary, Fabrics and fibers and even Swimming would have end of course exams. What questions would they even ask on these? How long has the district been planning this? Then she told us, ""We don't know what will be on them, all we know is that this test is created by teachers sending in questions to the district. The district is literally making it up as they go.""

We asked many more questions full of confusion and rage. When she then realized they have only made one test so far, a spanish test with no level. This test would be taken by spanish speakers and spanish learners all the same. This wasn't fair! It wasn't even comprehendable! We would be taking the same test as the French AP students!

This narrative explanitory essay is about the over load of testing that will be put upon the students of LOCATION_NAME. This ""random selection"" even if it was completly random, is just one the many irritating aspects of a SCHOOL_NAME students life at school for the next couple months, but maybe even up until we graduate!

I hope someone is reading this, and I hope I helped with your writing exam.               ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F8B406E59DDD,"Cars,the thing that all teenagers want when they turn sixteen. Driving gives a sense of freedom, but it comes with a price. Diving automotives pollutes the air with greenhouse gases. Cities like Paris, Vauban, and Bogota have some serious problems with pollution. Thats why we should limit vehicle usage.

Vauban, Germany is doing it wrong, by living in a ""car-free"" envirorment. The citizens that live here forbidden to own a car, driveway, and a home garage. There is a glimpse of light to all of you that love driving or need to drive to work. In this city, if somebody wanted to own an automotive they would have to pay an additional 40,000 dollars and live at the edge of the city limit. Pollution might be serious but you should just limit the commute to work so citizens don't have to drive so much. Think about it, if you force people that have cars to live on the city limit, but they might work in the middle of the city. I don't see the solution in that.

Paris, France, the city of love, is also the leading city in Europe of smog. ""passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe."" (Rosenthal 5).Paris is not so bad in book compare to Vauban. Paris has assigned certain days for the drivers to drive. On one day, even license plates will drive and the odds with drive the following day. There are precausions that they take if a odd driver drives on an even day. The drive will be fined 22 euros (that is 31 american dollars).There is nothing wrong with this plan exept if some one with an odd license plate has an emergency, and needs to take care of it posthaste.

Smog is not a good thing at all, and won't decrease until we do some thing about it. that a 'car-free"" day and bike to where ever you need to go. This our planet and we should take car of it.    ",2,Car-free cities,Text dependent
5D934B4BED8F,"In Source One the story talks about the advanges of redusing car usage in the German areas. It states that cars produse about 12% of greenhouse gas in Europe and about 50% in major car usage areas in the United States. Also, street parking is generally forbidden on the outskirts of Freiburg. Even though Vauban's street are completly ""car-free"", except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there is only two places to park, in a large garage outside their development where a space costs $40,000, or in their own homes. Because of this, about 70% of families in Vauban don't own car(s). Along with 57% of people that sold their car so they could move to Vauban.

In Source Two, in Paris, everyone who drove a car was fined, in two days about 4000 peopole were fined? That isnt actually a alot for a whole city, which is great news. Paris uses diesel fuel instead of gasoline, and now Paris is blaming that on their air pollution. Paris usually has more smog than any other European capital.

In Source Three, Bogota, Colombia has the Day Without Cars, where only public buses and taxis are allowed to drive in the city, anyone driving a car will be fined $25. the Day Qithout Cras started in the mid-1990s, and since then 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built. Parks and sport areas have also been built, along with more restaurants and shops near streets that used to be heavy with traffic, but now leave room for people to stop and visit.

852CDF33987C,"Although you may think of your car as a necessity, there are many advantages to not being behind the wheel. Greenhouse gas emisions would decrease and promote alternative tansportaion are amoung those many.

As the majority of people learned in grade school, greenhouse gases aren't such a great thing and are even destroying the planet. Stepping away from your car could decrease the amount of these deadly gases we put into our atmosphere. in the first article Rosenthal says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmision in Europe, and up to 50 in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" If the output is really that high and we stop using cars as much imagine the impact it could have if this happened world wide. in the second article Duffer was talking about how Paris had to ban cars because the smog, an effect of greenhouse gases, was too thick. towards the end he said that a few days of the car ban reduced the amount enough to where they could lift the ban. the smog was said to rival China's, and you see that on the news constantly so if only a few days made it significantly better then why can't we try it out?

Promoting alternative transportation could help local economies rise, and lower stress levels. ""It's a good oportunity to take away stress and lower air polution"" sais a business man participating in Bogata's car-free day. Participants in these events claim that they relieve stress and most people can see why, it's very hard to avoid stressful situations when you're driving. Whether it's the guy who cut you off or a slow old lady there is always something that will grind your gears. the executive chairman of the Ford company said that ""in cities where vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable they would be able to create a network that would save time, conserve resources, lower emisions, and improve safety."" If there are other sources of transportation available, why not take advantage of them?

Lowering our usage of cars we could keep our planet in good condition by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases and promoting alternative forms of trasportation which has benifits within itself.

00E9AC98B45E,"The invention of the automobile was one of the most important inventions of all time. Everyone uses cars! They're everywhere! But what are the effects of car emissions? Are they even worth using if they cause negative effects on people and our environment? Many people are trying to cut back on driving, or even live without cars. Why are they doing this? Well, let me inform you about some of the advanrtages of limited car usage throughout the world.

In Vauban, Germany, there is a suburb where people have decided to ban cars all together. The neighborhood roads are completely car-free and even having a garage is usually not allowed. About 5500 people live in this suburb and 70% of these people do not own cars. For the other 30%, there is a parking garage that is located on the edge of the community that requires a $40,000 payment to use. This trend is growing immensely in Europe and there could quite possibly be several communites that would mirror Vauban and what it is all about. This effort to ban cars is based on the idea of reducing pollution as well as reducing stress, and many members of the community insist they live happier and less stressful lives since moving into Vauban.

Bogota, Columbia is the home to nearly 7 million people, and in Bogota there is an annual car-free day, with hopes to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. There is also hope that this idea will spread to other cities and to other countries around the world. For the people who decide not to participate in the annual car-free day, a fine of $25 would be handed out. This ""holiday"" if you will, could be revolutionary potentially and if implemented year round, could really put a dent in the ammount of pollution throughout the city. Even the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay revered the program, saying it is ""generating a revolutionary change"".

Officials in Paris, France put a partial driving ban on the city in an effort to reduce smog in the city. The ban worked like this, on Monday, drivers with even-numbered license plates would not be allowed on the road. The next day, it would be the drivers eith odd-numbered license plates that would have to leave their cars at home. Nearly 4000 people were fined due to the enforcement of this ban, for somewhere around $120,000 total. The strictness of the ban was due to the seriousness of the smog and the fact that it was intensifying. The dissapearance of the smog resulted in loosening of the ban and less negative feedback from drivers.

As you can see, these places have been limiting car usage and found at least some sort of benefit from doing so. Maybe if these restrictions or all together bans were implemented in more places, pollution in the world would be hindered.            ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D2E3A806B00D,"Whether if it's a law in a country, the source of pollution or the cause of deaths, the usage of cars have its disadvantages and have been limited. However, driving cars have its advantages when individuals limit the use of it.

Using cars to reach a destination causes pollution according to experts, who are  correct. According to paragraph 5, ""experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions tailpipies...Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Because of this there has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities safer and easier to breathe in. A city that faces these pollution problems is Paris, which made authorities to prohibit driving. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" This is the right thing to do because after this law was implemented there was less congestion. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" Pollution also has more of an impact depending on the tempertaure and day. ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layers of air to trap car emissions."" Also there are cities where using cars are near impossible, because of the laws that the governmental officials had enforced. An example of a city with these laws is Vauban, Germany. ""Street Parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban's streets are completely 'car-free.'''

However, There are advantages when individuals drive less. Owners of the public transportation have taken action. They subilminally convinced drivers to reduce pollution and dangerous accidentals by offering free transportation. ""Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday."" When this was taken into action, smog was cleared in cities. ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."" When individuals drive less they are exposed to new activities that they have never experienced when driving. People can experience activities in places such as in Bogota, Colombia. ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" The main goal for this was to advocate other transportation in order to reduce pollution. There are also other factors that can substitute the place of driving. A suggestion was made by Mimi Sheller, who is a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of the University's Policy center and Mobilities Research. She said that ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Also that ""the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangments, including the evolution of shared services for getting to work."" Bill Ford, who is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company has also suggested factors for safety and transportation. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'""

49D4BB623BE8,"Many people in todays society tend to travel by car, but there is advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can stop pollution, and puts people in general in a more active environment. So, there are many other ways of transportation.

In the article, 'Car-Free Cities' it talks a lot about the advantanges of not driving a car. For example, according to the passage ""Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occaional distant motor."" This being said, you can conclude that more people are being more active. Furthermore, the passage says ""Passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" This meaning that some places in the United states gases are half of the areas pollution.

There are many more advantages to limiting car usages, and if other people do it so will the world. For example, according to the passage ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangle square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life."" Moreover, in the passage it also says ""But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" Furthermore, ""In this new approach, store are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distance highway."" This meaning the world has a solution to solve the usage of cars. By making suburbs you will be walking distance away from your destination. This also saves so much money, if you were to drive you would have to waste gas. It is also more of a benefit for one who walks, rides their bike, or runs by giving them the benefit of exercise.

By limiting the usage of cars, bike trails, parks, and sports centers have been a big hit. For example, according to the passage, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" Moreover, ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicylce paths."" This being said, the need to make such a long bike path means that more people are joining in on the limiting usage of cars, which is a benefit for us humans, and the fresh air that we breathe. People are also becoming more active, for example according to the passage ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaces by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;"" Since the parks and sports centers have been blooming people are being more active. New side walks are being replaced so people can actually walk on them, the cut of traffic means less people are driving. In big cities, it just might be faster to get to your destination by riding a bike.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. It helps by lowering the percent of pollution, on top of that it also helps save money. By walking or riding your bike to your destination can benefit you in many ways. It also helps by making the world a better place. People seem to be happier when they see other being active, so the next time one thinks to drive a walking distance, rethink your decision.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D3D2660F2D77,"Using a motor vehicle as a source of transportation is part of everyday life and is not rare to the stereotypical American. But cities such as Paris, Bogota, and Vauban are all striving towards reducing the rate of motor vehicle usage in their areas. Advantages of limiting car usage are lower greenhouse gas rates, suburbs can become more compact and more accesible to public transportation, and people are able to live less stressful lives.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the enviornment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the enviornment but unfortunetly not for car companys. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital and is working towards a way to fix that. Paris banned driving due to the intensity and abundance of the smog in their city and had people use public transportation free of charge for about a week. Not using motor vehicles for those days really did help the situation of Paris and gave people an insight as to how life would be without cars.

Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of Vauban's family do not own cars and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there. ""Smart planning"" is a component of the movement to seperate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact enviornment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, ""Car-free day"" is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.

Dropping off your kid at daycare, then driving to work, then having to drive your child to soccer practice can be a constant and stressful cycle for most parents. Residents of suburbs that have low car usage rates claim that they are less stressful. In a suburban community with little to no motor vehicle usage, the suburb will be more compact, having more stores and buildings closer to eachother at very short distances. This makes it easier for residents to get from point A to point B quicker and more efficiently. This also allows for more walking areas with less traffic and dangerous cars to worry about.

the passage ''In German Suburb, life goes on Without Cars'' In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. a souce says ''when i had a car i was always tense, im much happier this way.'' One of the advantages of not owning a car in this community was the feeling of a more compact and accessiable way to public transportation. By not having cars if you were to walk down the street instead of hearing car motars distantly running, sources say they hear the sound of bikes and adults and even childrens chatter filling their ears. With not having cars it can make it so much easier to get social and connect with others in your area instead of being a hermit you can meet new people, make friends and even create plans which is a major benifit.

In ''Paris bands driving due to smog,'' Paris,Frace also had the same idea to get rid of cars to clear the air of their global city. This can help with allergies and getting sick which als can cause some to become less social towards others. This largely well know city's expectations where correct. Congestion went down 60% clearing the air for a better enviroment for residents. With the city having a lower air pollution and smog reduced, a benifit of not having a car is free public trasportation Monday-Friday. This saves tons of money that you could have used to pay for gas,car insurance,and any costly repairs or damage you might need to fund for.

The city Bogota, located in Columbia as well limited the usage of cars .In ''Car free Day is Spinning into a big hit in Bogota,'' Instead people biked,hiked,skated which makes you become more active,and residents took public buses as well; promoting alternitive transportation. This of course helped to reduce the smog and lowered the air pollution. Not having to worry about a car is also a benefit in which it reduces stress .Limiting car usage also cuts traffic making it quicker to get to your designated location safer which is more benificial.

The end of car culture also benifits implications for carbon emissions, again helping our living space. People feel more connceted with out driving to meet up with a group of friends because of the internet. saving time for the long boring drive,concerving resources, lowering emissions and improving safety are all so important to us now and later down the road if we limit our usage of cars.

The sitiuation got so bad that 12% percent of the passengers cars were responsible for greenhouse gas emission in Europe. And 50% percent of some car intensive areas in the united states. Many people tried to make an effort for the past two decades to make the cities denser.

Developments have started to change since world war II , David goldbreg made efforts for the transportation for america amd fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups. In New york suburbs with out spread out homes and private garages were the dreams town of the 1950's and still exert a strong appeals. Why did paris ban driving ? after days of the pollution recorded nears to high rates to a danger zone. The pollution causes motorists to leave their automobile at home or get fined 22 euro ($31),many reports were saying almost 4,000 drivers have been fine because they chose to drive their cars. The smog congestion was down to 60% percent because beijing,china was one of the biggest cities with most polluted cities in the world.

Diesel fuel was one of the worst ways to travel around with ,because it causes alot more pollution,diesel makes up to 67% percent of vehicles in france compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western europe according to reuters. The smog created a car free day , the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars in this capital ofcity of seven million. Many violaters faced a $25 fines, municipal authorities from others countries came to bogota , improvements campaign in the mid 1990's. The smog also created a 118 mile paths for most latin american city according to Mockus,the city mayor. Some sidewalks have been replaced by broad .\, smooth sidewalks, rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic.

President Obama ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled. America adjusted the population growth, the number of driven miles in the united states peaked in 2005 anmnd dropped steadily. By the many measures the decrease preceded the downturn and appear to be persisting now that will be recovered under way. Over the years driving has been decreasing because of the polluted areas in other countries. But many citizens refused to ride bike or take buses for transportation. So the causes has everyone to end of the car culture.          ",1,Car-free cities,Text dependent
DF0DE9A65987,"As time progresses, more and more young people aren't buying personal cars but instead use public transport or walk to where they need to go. Other than the youth, suburbs have found this as a great way to destress as some cities, like Bogota, Columbia, have dedicated a day to stop the use of personal cars for one day. This decline of using our own cars has a positive effect on our air and the way our youth has begun to travel.

People around the world are starting to make this transition from using their personal cars to using public transport or carpooling with friends. The youth today try to mange their schedules so they can find ways to use more and more of public transit. ""There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16 and 39 year-olds getting a license..."" (Rosenthal 38), meaning that most of the youth these days are finding it easier and, though a little more time consuming, less worrisome than buying or driving a personal car. It seems getting a license isn't taking top priority for the youth. ""In a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between  2001 and 2009..."" (Rosenthal 41).Whether the youth is going to start buying cars when they have children or not, it seems the general decline of buying automobiles for yourself isn't a boom like it used to be.

Experiments being hosted all over the world in small areas also show that using no cars is decreasing pollution and allowing us cleaner air overall. In Bogota, Columbia, a program that bans all cars for one day, and despite terrible weather for the third year, and it seems that people are loving it. And despite the threatening rain, the turn out was huge (Selsky 22).  ""...experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes...""(Rosenthal 5). Our personal cars ""are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in the United States where areas are heavily populated with car owners""(Rosenthal 5). Numbers like this would decline over time if we start using less and less cars. Maybe then we'd actually have fresh air to breath rather than the polluted air we breath now. Even in Paris, where they have ""enough smog to compete with Beijing""(Duffer 14) they banned cars for a while. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paries enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer 10). As they enforced the ban, smog started to clear up around the city, meaning that no cars can really help clear up the air we breath in daily.

As the air begins to clear up and our youth taking a stand against owning their own cars, it seems like this could be a steady decline of personal cars and more will start using public transport. It seems time is progressing to an age where young people don't feel the haste of using personal cars and instead resort to public transport.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent
852A7F32C8A5,"Its no secret that driving automobiles has alot to do with how much pollution is pumped into the air. The biggest issue with driving a car in crowded areas is the smog build up. Many countrys have taken an interest in limiting cars temporarly to decrease smog, or dedicating individual communitys to a car free area with the exception of buses and taxis.

High pollution levels is a rising epedemic that needs to be stoppped before it is out of hand or un-reversable. Many country's plan to action is limiting car usage for a certain amount of time untill the smoge is under control. It states in source two paragraph ten that ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Within the five days that this rule was enforced the smog in the city had decreased by 60 percent.

Many people tend to rely on cars in their everday life. What people need to realize is that there are other forms of transportation that is just as easy and far less toxic to the planet and to ourselfs. In source 1 paragraph 3 a woman states "" when i had a car i was always tense, im much happier this way."" It is clear that the use and want for owning and using your own car has went down emensly since 1995. People call it a cultural shift excpecially in America where cars are so heavily manufactured and bragged about.

In conclusion, cars are a huge reason why the world is so polluted. This wouldnt be such an issue if so many people didnt use cars in their everday life. Once poeple realize that they can still be perfectly content without having to drive everywhere is when this planet will make a big turn around in the way we try to protect the planet.

00944C693682,"Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons.

For starters, stress. It is no secret that morning traffic jams and 5'o'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly car-less community, claiming ""when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [She's] much happier [that] way"" (Source 1). If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say ""it's a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" (Source 3). Just one day was enough to de-stress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event ""[left] the streets of [Bogota] eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3), which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them?

Additionally, the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Source 1). This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage. If that were not enough, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (Source 4). It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even car-pooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through ""more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Source 4).

Of course, adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone's general health. Both stress and high concentrations of smog can do a toll on one's body and the reduction of cars, once again, helps to reduce this terrible down-sides to the easy transportation option. If it must be described as ""emissions ... are choking cities"" (Source 1), then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with pre-existing respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other task-oriented location that many go to with the aid of a car.

It is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have given back anything the newly car-less citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money. In Vauban, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1). This is not only much more cost-efficient, but also convienent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where ""parks and sports centers [] have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3). Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well.

Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.

hese two articles both shows reasons why we should limit car usage. I know people are going to be like, "" How am i going to get to work?"", "" How am i going to do this and that with out my car?"", but if you sit down and really think about it there are some very good reasons why us fellow citizens should limit our car usage.

On paragraph 3 source 1: In German Suburb Life Goes Without Cars, it says "" when i had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way, a media trainer and mother of two as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and he chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor"" in this quote it talks about how a mom is going green and starts walking and bicycling instead of driving every day. If you drive everyday you lose alot of money thru out the year spending on gas, car repairs etc. and you pullute the air, now a days the air that we breath is getting worse and worse by the years passed but we could fix it if we limit our car usage. With going green and limited driving you could start walking and get good excersise, our world to day not doing so good and one main reason is because of pullution and obesity. You could knock both of those out by just simply walking to the store instead od drving and losing gas. Cars are graeat dont get me wrong, they have been the a big impact om our world but it changed over the years as people started buying cars and gas prices and oil prices are going up, we should all just go green for a while.

It will help if you just stop drving one time a week, that will make a impact to our society. I dont think people shouold be fined for driving a car that they payed for and that is theirs, if you could talk well and a good persuader you could change the mind of the citizens. Hopefully the world changes and goes green a little more eery thing helps.      ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
24C584D3D271,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing the usage of cars we can lower the air pollution in our cities. If the number of cars on the road is lower than usual, then the number of traffic jams and car crashes will be decreased. Driving is a huge responsibility and worrying about protecting your life, the passengers in your cars life, and other drivers on the road's life can be very stressful at times.  Lowering the usage of cars can limit that stress.

Polloution is bad and it destroys the Earth. When we drive, our tailpipes give off greenhouse emmissions that ravage the o-zone layer of our atmoshphere. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. The congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. By reducing our car usage, we can make our world a more clean and less polluted place.

Traffic jams are annoying and frustrating. Car crashes are dangers and life altering. You can avoide both of these terrible things by limiting how often you drive your car. Everytime you sit down in that drivers seat and turn the car on, there is a chance of getting stuck in traffic or into a wreck. There is no better way to avoid this than walking, taking a bus, or biking where ever you need to go. In a program that was set to spread to other countries, millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses yesterday, leaving the streets of Bogota, Colombia free of traffic jams.

Driving can put a tremendous amount of stress on a person. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. You don't have to live with all of that stress. Just limit yout car usage and you will live a happier life.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. You can lower air pollution. Driving less reduces the chances of you getting in a traffic jam or worse, a car accident. Last but most certainly not least, driving less reduces stress.                     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
6D417F773D10,"In Columbia, Germany, and Paris they are trying to limit the usage of cars in many ways so that they can improve the air and promote alternate transportation.

By reducing car usage like they did in paris where they made people with even numbered license plates leave there cars at home then the next day did the same thing to people with odd numbered licence plates. People who dident follow this rule were fined twenty-two euro's or thirty-one dollars. About 4,000 people did not folow the rule and got fined and about 27 of them got detained due to the reaction they gave when recieving the fine. By implementing this in Paris it brought down congresion by sixty percent after five days. This is a reason why car usage should be limited.

Germany is trying to. In a city called Vauban, cars are banned. You can own a car which you can park in one of two garages the town has on the outskirts but it cost 40,000 dollars so people tend to sell there car. In the town stores are built down the main road in walking distance due to the fact that there are no cars. This town is an experimental new district, on the outskirts of freiburg, close to the french and swiss borders. The town is totaly ""Car-Free"" if you dont count the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown freiburg runs. If this town spreads around the world and othere towns and cities implement the same idea we could lower pollution and better the enviorment. If we build everything closer there will be o nead for cars so thats another reason why we should limit car usage.

In columbia they implemented a car-free day where every one took buses, road bikes and other neat things to get from place to place. This program is wanted to spread to other countries. In the third straight year of implementing this idea they banned all cars on that day except buses and taxis. The goal is to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. Violaters faced a twenty-five dollar fine. Aside from the occasinal rain storms, this idea is a good way to ""take away stress and lower air pollution."" said ny businessman Carlos Arturo plaze as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. For the first time two othere columbian cities join the event. The cites are Cali and Valledupa. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictios have dramatically ut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This is all in result of that event. Quoted from sorce 3.

As you can see there are many was to reduce air pollution and promote alternate transporation.

64C858F302EF,"Numerous amount of people would love to experince the opportunities of limiting their time with their car. There are a great amount of advantages of limiting car usage. Advantages include having a more healthy environment, decreasing stress, and reducing traffic.

The advantages of limiting car usage is helping the environment. ""Passanger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" While most of the adult population is driving cars everyday, more gas and smoke go into the air and into our environment. This causes pollution and hurts our environment. Paris has a major smog problem in their environment, up to the point where it was near-recorded. Paris had to then enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The effect of this ban was that congestion was down 60 percent and the smog cleared after a short week.  If we were able to limit our car usage, then our greenhouse gas emissions would decrease. ""In the United States, the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act."" There are numerous environmental agencies that are already starting to act to decrease the car usage in the country. We should limit our car usage because it can greatly help our environment.

If were able to limit our car usage, then it will greatly decrease our stress of driving. Many countries are trying to reduce car usage. An example is Columbia. Columbia has created a car-free day. ""Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses during car-free day, leaving the streets eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Bogota, Colombia have practiced this day for three years and many colombians have been pleased with it. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"", said businessman Carlos Plaza. Without driving, you have the time to go out, be active and get exercise. A huge effect of the car free day is that park and sport centers have been built all throughout Bogota, smoother sidewalks, and rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic. With car usage reduced, it limit people's stress on driving.

If we were able to lower the number of car usage, then our streets would be much safer and there would be less traffic. Many people use cars today and because of that most of streets are usually blocked up. If there were less cars on the streets then it would be easier and quicker to go to places. Vanban, Germany is an example of an car-free town. ""...basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls alond some distant highway."" With less cars on the streets, it can also reduce car accidents and deaths. If there were less cars on the roads, there would be less traffic and car accidents.

693C3112ED21,"Since the invention of the first automobiles, negative impacts such as greenhouse gases, and other enviromental effects have plauged the world in a very short amount of time. Some people are taking action, like in certain cities such as Vauban Germany, paris and Colombia, by taking efforts to reduce the use of cars for transportation. Ultimatly, as people begin the shift from autombile transport; certain economic, enviromental, and societal advantages will benifit the world we live in today.

In Vauban germany, residents of the town are starting to take efforts in the first of ""car-free"" societies. To most people this idea could seem unpractical, but car free living can be very benefitial, to the enviroment and daily life. For instance, people in Vauban claim that they feel very tense when they own, and have to drive a car to and from places that they have to work. The layout of these cities like vauban, are unique because they are very dense, unlike the urban and suburban towns of america. This makes walking and biking a more easy method of transportation without having the negative effects of green house gases. In Bogota Colombia, residents are also realizing the the benefits that come with no cars, in wich they have a car- free day that spawns a whole new way of life. The new methods of transportation then become centered around bikes, walking, and other methods of non poluting trasnportation. This also leads to a benefit on the economy, by having 118 miles of bicycle paths built, new walking paths, resturaunts, and shopping districts being created.

In Paris, near-records pollution caused by smog, forced city leaders to take action, banning all cars in a 2 day period; and fining all violators of this new ban. This limited congestion in the capital by 60%. Free public transit was also issued for the exception of the ban, even though almost 4000 drivers were fined and some had their cars impound; which certainly helped the number of pollutants on the streets. The smog cleared enough on monday, to where all odd numbered plates were free of the ban on tuesday. These notacable enviromental effects were so substantial in such a short amount of time, that it could spawn a whole new wave of car banning cities to help thier local enviroment. If every city was based around this ideal, it would help their local enviroment, ultimatly helping their economic industries. Globally, this would make a huge change in the world wide market and decrease greenhouse gases.

The United States is also seeing a change in the amount of people that are buying fewer cars and driving less. These kinds of trends will ultimatly benefit the society if continued, by limiting carbon emissions. Although this would hurt the car industry, it would help other parts of the economy like agriculture and ocean based fishing, by helping these ecosystems to produce more effectivly. Places like New York also have bike-sharing programs, which would have a impact on people's health too. Most people do not realize the postitive effects that daily exercise can have upon yourself. For example; if every person in New york walked to where they work every morning; new york would experiance a wave of healthy, happy, individuals. Even large car companies like ford are stating that pedestrain, bicycle, and public trasprotation save time, lower emissions and improve safety.

Overall, benifits of reducing car transportation is too great to be ignored. It is a step in the right direction that people are taking action and rising up for the greater good of their local towns and spreading awareness by these actions. Our future could go either way, we can continue on this path and do whats right for the enviroment, or neglect the earth we live on and face the consequences.                                    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
D8D0B46D3265,"Walking, jogging, or even riding a bike. All ways of transportation, right? And also, the car. Of course that'd be the intial thing most people would want rather than actually exercising to get from one point to another. However, limiting car usage would be better for our planet and for us.

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars , it has a bystander that says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter. She is a mother of two, and she has walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. So, not only is she a mother of two and basically walks everywhere, driving made her tense. And she claims to actually be happier walking rather than using a car to transport her to different areas. Another thing from this article includes this line, ""...Ad that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" So, if we were to not necessarily drive too often, we'd be doing the Earth a favor in making the world more dense.

Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog , already off the bat. Driving in Paris is basically banned, because of smog. It states, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" All the gases that are in the air due to cars and such could very well just harm us, and Earth. However, it is a good thing that Paris had banned that, because people who've tried to keep driving, has had to suffer a 22-euro fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. Other people care about our world enough to get them to stop what they're doing. Or, at least ban it for a while. But, typically, Paris has more smog than other European capitals. It says, ""[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of the particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" Now, not trying to argue with this, however, not driving for a while is something that'd be better for not just Europe, but everywhere around the world. It's a big deal, and our ozone layer could basically kill us in the end.

Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota , now, by this article, it pretty much states that trying to promoted alternative transportation and reducing smog had violaters face $25 fines. It was the third year straight they've tried to do this, but people still got caught doing it. But, it does mention, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo. He does have a point here, because it helps us in the end. Another thing it adds is, ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that begain in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the contrustion of 118 miles of bicyle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor."" So basicallt not driving is a relatively great thing for us, now, not driving for a while is not any intention, but limiting it is probably what's best.

And last but not least,

The End of Car Culture , it claims that fewer people over the years have not been getting licenses and buying cars. Which, is a good sign for us. As a world all together, we shouldn't be depending on transportation (by car, of course), to get anywhere. It's much better this way for us to do this because it's mainly how we're effecting the Earth that's the problem, well.. and obesity but it's not a huge concern. But, that's just the way it is. It goes on to say that people 19-21 and older in some cases haven't even wanted a car or even attempt to get their license. And that says something. We're changing, and that's a great thing. Of course, we still will use cars, but hopefully not as much as we used to basically.

To conclude this, other transportation other than driving, would be better for the world, and we could use something else to make it better for us. Of course we'd still use cars, but not using it as much would definitely be our goal in today's world.                              ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

""What are some advantages of limiting car usage?"" You want to know some advantages right? Well there are some advanages like losing stress,relaxing,and helping the envoriment. Bet you didnt know that! but im going to explain to you why know because your probely curious why?

Want to know an of advantage of limiting car usage? Well heres one, as said in source number 3 paragraph 24 ""Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with hus wife."" It says that when not usuing a car you can loose stress just by riding a bike because its less traffic and stuff. So when you dont use a car you can loose stress.

But thats not just the only advantage, theres more! another advantage is that it can make you relax as well because then you would be able to spend more ""family"" time and some ""you"" time because you wont have to worry about  going to places if you cant use your car. Ands thats relaxing because theres nothing better to then to be with your family having fun relaxing.

But that not it! the most advange to this topic is that your helping the envoriment! why you may ask? well like as said in source 3 paragraph 24 "" Its a good opportunity to take away lower air pollution"" thats some evidence i found because has  Carlos Arturo Plaza was riding his bike thats what he said. So he said bascilly that when you use a car your polluting the environment but when you done use a car then not polluting th environment is a advange. So therefore helping your environment is a advange to this topic, and the most important one!

So you wanted to know some advangaes tolimiting car usage? Well you got your answer. i had give 3 reasons to you have some advanages for limiting car usage. As loosing stress,relaxing,and helping the enviroment, these are some great atvanges but theres many more. I just didnt want to list more because i though i would bored you to death!

But it can also be pretty nerve wrecking knowing you have to walk everywhere you want to go. But the more walking you do, the less money your spending. Having no worries about paying for gas, car notes, tickets, etc.

Another good thing about not having a car is staying in shape. Walking around to get to where you need to go would get you more than plenty excerise. Nothing like having a nice healthy body, burning calories, and even pounds. Having nice strong and healthy heart and burning off the fat that you put on by doing nothing and being physically active by walking.

Less accidents, car jams, traffic problems, and even car polution. What parent doesn't want a cleaner air for there children to breathe? Less cars can somehow lead to an safer enviornment. Less car accidents dealing with people texting and driving, which could lead to less possiblities of death maybe.

No one wants to walk everywhere their trying to go, nothing wrong with going for a nice bike ride there. Limiting car usage can maybe differ the world, cause less problems, less worries, and the best of all. . . SAVE MORE MONEY!    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

The benefits of limiting car usage is that the evvironment will be a lot healthier. According to experts ""[Automobiles are] a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes,""(Source #1).

86A39056FB93,"Giving up a car can be difficult. But if you all knew more about cars, perhaps you all would stop using them. Or at least limiting the usage of your car. Lowering the pollution rate in the world would defenetlly be an advantage. There would br more space for other things to be built. And besides, cars are a one of the many ways people die.

Cars are so mediocre for our environment. . ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The percentage is lower in Europe due to the fact that Europeans drive less that the people in United States do. The Environmental Protection Agency are promoting ""car reduced"" communities in the United States. Beijing, China, is on eof the most polluted cities in the entire world. Many countries and cities are enforcing a partial driving ban to get rid of the air pollution. Places like France, Paris, London and even Bogota, Colombia. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlose Arturo, a businessman. Studies in  America show that as each year goes by, less and less Americansare buying or driving cars. Studies also show fewer licenses are getting distributed each year.

Driving fewer cars means that roads really aren't useful anymore. So, that leaves room for other things to be built. Things like parks, restaurants, shopping centers, and it woould be great for promoting or expanding companies. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hourrestrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

Finally, cars are one of the many ways people die. Statistics show that car crashes are more likely to happen than getting in a plane crash or any other type of collision. Especially for teens who have just got their license. Many peopole die from car crashes, just think about all the losses we could prevent from happening. Just because that person didn't mean anything to you doesn't mean they weren't loved by someone else.

In conclusion, you should see the many things we could avoid with cars. The many advantages we would have without cars. We would have less pollution, more space for other things to be built, and the lives of your loved ones. Even if you choose not to stop driving your car, at least limit the usage of it, or you coud car-pool.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent

But, cars arent that great they are actually causeing alot of damage. the pollution that is given off by cars is ridculous. most people dont relize the damage they are doing let alone the affect cars have on your life.

Frist off, cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse house emissions in europe. In some car-intensive areas in the  United states the greenhouse emissions are about 50 percent from cars! thats alot people are causeing without really knowing if we were to get the word out maybe we could change it and make the world cleaner.

Secondly, the united states environmental agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. they want to make cities and towns more compact and close together. Because in the suburbs cars play such a huge role. these places arent very compact, so people cant just walk everywhere that would take all day. but on the upside walking everywhere is good excerise so while your getting rid of pollution, your also lossing the obesity rate in the united states.

then, in Paris they have banned cars due to smog. Anyone who drove would be fined 22 euros (31 dollars). congestion in the captial france was down almost 60 percent. after a little bit of time enough smog had cleared so they could rescind the ban.

after, in Bogota, Colombia they started a car free  day were everyone took buses, biked, hiked, walked or any means of transportaion except cars to get to work. this reduces smog in that area. all of this walking and so forth also helps people relive stress.  which wil drop the crime rates.

Lastly, in the untied states gas emissions are quite high. but, are believed to go down beacuase in  a recent study , fewer people each year are buying cars or getting liscence. they say if this pattern contuines and they think it will cars will stop coming around.

Using a car to get from point A to point B is getting out of hand and unnecissary. Limiting car usage can help save money, it can also help prevent smog or other pollution, and can make humans live a healthier life style. By limiting car usage, you are changing your life style for the better.

Less car usage can play a major role in the way you live your life. One big part of your life it could change is financial issues. Without a car you wouldnt have to spend thousands of dollars on an overpriced vehical. Also you could save money from not having to buy overly priced gas, or having to fix any car issues, such as an oil leak. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog , the author states,"" Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters."" Without all of your money going down the drain, you could spend your money in a more helpful way. With the money that you don't have to spend with car trouble, someone could by a gym membership, or they could go and renovate their house the way that they have always wanted. Without spending loads of money on a car, gas, and car problems, you could spend your money on more important things such as paying of loans.

Less car usage could also help the envirnment dramtically. Because of the ussage of cars the envinment has been hugely effected. Since the envirnment has been greatly affected, so has the people. Smog has been becoming a result of the pollution that cars cause. In the passage,

Paris bans driving due to smog, they state,""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while excepltions were made for plug-in cars."" Not only is pollution affecting the envirnment, but it is also affecting the way that we live our lives, and the way that we make our livings. Without the use of cars income will increse rather than decrease. Also the smog is creating a hazard to everyone who has to work, or go to school. Without the use of cars there will be no more smog, or hazardess envinments to worry about.

Besides money, and pollution, there are other important reasons why less car usage would be ideal. A main point of less car usage would be for health. The world has grown to be lazy, and as a result obesity is becoming a huge issue. Walking to work, or to school can not only help the envirnment, but also help your immune system, and weight loss. Instead of walking, another great form of exercise that will help the envirnment is riding your bike. Using these tips there will be less obesity, and less pollution, and grrenhouse gas in the world.

Even though that driving has decreased 23% in the last 8 years, it is our duty to insure that the world will once again be a safe envirnment for everyone to live in. To insure a safe envirnment, the usage of cars must decrease. If the usage of cars does not decrease our money will. Money won't be the only problem though, obesity, and also smog will increase. To help save the Earth humans must cut back on using their cars. The results will be life changing.     ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

I think that if people walked instead of cars they would be happier and healthier.

if people didnt use cars as thier way of tranportation then there would be less pollution in the air that can make people sick, and there would be dangerous gases that cars emit.

They have done this because there tail pipe emmisions,the smoke is unhealthy to breathe,and most people cant afford a car.

The emmisions from the tail pipe that comes out of the car is cause in most passengers car is the cause for the 12% of the greenhouse gases in Europe and 50% in the U.S.A.most cities have been trying to cut back on the car use or public transportation many will still ride a bus or drive to avoid walking or bycicling. The united states EPA is sugesting to promote cars reduced communities as it is stated in the article to play a larger role in a new six-year transportation program.

C11691BE646E,"In America, cars have been an integral part of our culture; from the Model T. Ford to the Mustang cars have cemented themselves into our mindset. But currrently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowdy. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completly in certain areas in order to be more environmentally freindly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inhaled on a daily basis, can lead to lung cancer. By limiting car usage people can benefit more to the people; for example in Paris,France a partial driving ban was enforced in order to clear the air of smog after days of near-record pollution. By doing this congestion was brought down by 60 percent helping to majorly clear the air and make breathing better for people.

In Vauban, Germany residents of the area have been called suburban pioneers due to gibving up their cars. By doing this people were able to be more happy and enjoy life more. For example, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" this aids the argument that by banning or limiting car usage people are able to be much calmer and benefit more. In Bogota, Colombia during ""Car-free day"" for the first time two colombian cities joined Bogota in this unique event. there more parks and sports centers for people were placed, the sidewalk were smoothe and more business and commercial areas were opened up for people. This further shows that pweople can benfit greatly without having cars.

Throughout the world wherever cars have been limited or banned there has always been one constant, new alternative transportation. In China in order to help reduce the absurd amount of smog and air pollution, chinese citizens resorted to using bikes leading to a drop in smog levels. By limiting cars and replacing them with alternative transportation people can be much safer from more dangerous situations, such as car acsidents hurting people, keeping dunk drivers away from the steering wheel, and being able to save more money from not buying a car. Though some alternate vehicles are not fast enoguh for example bikes, this has been remedied in some areas by allowing free public transit from buses and taxi services.

Throughout all of these benfits people can benfit more greatly but that's not enough. In 2012 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford proposed a business plan in where partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation trafic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""-""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Through bright ideas like the advantages of limiting cars can be fully realized and brought to life in order to help and save more people from negative aftereffects. In America if people were to cut down on car use people could benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

F8BD33BC0C9B,"Humankind has always been fascinated with the concept of cars. Motorized vehicles that effortlessly take you from one area to another when compared to more traditional methods such as walking. Everyone wanted a car for themselves to become a part of the innovation. But as time has passed, we now realized that it was naive of us to think cars were going to revolutionize transport, as some of the more simpler ways of transport (bike riding, bus) outshined car ownership in practicality and efficiency.

Now more than ever, alternative transportation methods are being promoted heavily in order to reduce the amount of pollution in the atmosphere. A shining example of this is in Paris, France (""Paris bans driving due to smog"", source two), where the goverment took the initiative to limit the usage of vehicles to reduce the amount of smog in the city.

Paris, one of the most idolized cities in the world, was at a point where the density of smog and pollutants in the air rivaled Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. However, after the driving ban in Paris, the city saw a drastic reduction in the amount of pollutants in the air, as it dropped down from 147 micrograms of particulate matter/cubic meter. Not only that, but Paris also saw an inprovement in car traffic, dropping down to 40 percent of what it originally was five days after the ban.

With all this in mind, how does this benefit the population without looking at the pollution reduction? This can also benefit us physically and psychologically. In Bogota, Colombia, a generally congested city, filled with traffic jams and other problems; Mayor Antanas Mockus promoted alternative transportation in the ""Day Without Cars event""(Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, source 3). In an effort to encourage public transportation in the city of 7 million inhabitants, Mockus promoted an event in which the only form of motorized transportation available was taxi cabs and bus rides. This mean that the people took the opportunity to bike, walk, hike from one point to another. Subsequently, this also indirectly promoted physical fitness and a stress release for people wanting to take the chance to enjoy their day. As Carlos Plaza evidently states that it is a great way to take away stress, while on a bike ride with his wife. Colombia has also opened up new bike path, parks, and sports centers, which is all the more proof that this initiative is promoting physical fitness and psychological wellness.

One could argue that this revolution of alternative transportation could have negative consequences on car industries and other businesses that rely on personal vehicle, and they wouldn't be wrong. But this phenomenon doesn't necessarily have to hurt anyone, as these same industries can promote their time and resources on projects that also promote alternative transportation. Just as well, in recent years, the amount of people getting driver's licenses and relying on personal vehicles has seen a significant decline, such as the amount of young prople driving decreaed 23 percent from 2001 to 2009, or when a study showed the amount of miles driven by the average American peaked in 2005 and steadily declined since then (The End of Car Culture, Source 4). People started to see the efficiency of alternative transportation, and capitalized on the opportunity to make transportation more accessible to everyone. Whether its from the expanding biclycle paths in New York City, to the Bay Area Rapid Transport in San Francisco, these are just a few examples of the steadily growing list of cities promoting more accessible transportation.

So with all of this in mind, there is irrefutable evidence that the more simpler methods of alternative transportation to limit vehicular usage is more efficient and practical. As seen in Paris where the city saw a significant drop in the amount of smog the city contained. Or when Bogota where an event that banned vehicular usage promoted physical and psychological wellness. People opting for alternative transportation is the global phenomenon that benefits us in more ways than we can imagine. There''s no doubt that the older, more traditional methods of transportation out perform personal vehicles in efficiency.    ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent

To get more in depth, Vauban is an experimental upscale community where streets attempt to be car free. This city is an example of what car limitation can be capable of. Cars have gases and carbon emission that are released when put in use. This can harm our atmosphere by trapping in greenhouse emssions. Statistics from experts demonstate that in Europe passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and up to an unbelievable 50 percent in the United States alone. The efforts of car limitation can be an advantage into stopping these gases from growing in the near future.

Paris, France is a smog filled European city due to the large congestion and diesel engines. On a Monday motorists with even-numbered plates had to leave their cars at home or suffer a 31 dollar fine. Due to the restriction, congestion over the following five days was down 60 percent. Also opening up, wasthe free charge of the public transit. The restriction of cars opened up great advantages to decline the number of congestion which lowered the percentage of carbon emissions. If the population can take the limitations one period at a time the communities can experience cleaner air and healthier enviroments.

In conclusion, although cars are a covinient and easy way to get around, they can result in the harming of the enviroment and us as individuals. If we can all lower the emissions and sorts of congestions, the world and people can start to be happy knowing they're living in healthy enviroments with the inspirations of these cities such as Paris and Vauban.     ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
595AA4B43800,"HOLD ON!! Street parking, driveways and home garages have been forbidden in the new district? And if you do want to park your car in a garage you have to buy one for $40,000? What a rip off. But wait.. there is barley any space to park, like, a bus. A lot of people are happy they don't have cars. Everything is near by. The district is really small. If they go out of their house and wanted to walk to their local grocery store the store would be right across the street.

After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Some drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded due to their reaction of the fine. The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was there to blame. Diesel's made up to 67 percent of vehicles in France compaired to a 53.3 percent average.

In Bogota, Colombia cars have been banned for three years only having buses and taxis as their transportation. If they had a car, they would have recieved a $25 fine. This whole car banning thing was an event because two other cities joined and they were Cali and Valledupar. Colombia isn't that small of a city. People need transportation. I mean, yeah a lot of people mostly hike, but what if they need a car to really get somewhere, like, if it was an emergency? But after this car banning, Colombia has made an improvement. There has been construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city. Uneven, pitted, messed up sidewalks has been replaced with broad, smooth sidewalks.

Obama's goal is to save the greenhouse gas emissions. Obama has been seeing that barley anybody has been buying cars. Why? The money is rising. Cars and gas has been getting expensive. America's love with vehicles has been cooling. In 2005, car driven miles has dropped steadily. In April, 2013, the miles driven per person has dropped 9 percent to where it has been below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Now, the greenhouse has been getting better plants.

In conclusion, car bannings has made a huge improvement in countries and states. Gas is being lessed used, greenhouse has been getting better plants, people don't really need cars if they have everything near buy but in some cases they do for emergency. The driving miles on cars have decreased incredibly. In Bogota the streets, and bicylce lanes have improved. There arent anymore jacked up sidewalks. Money has been saved to make the world look like a better place.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
C2D3552811EC,"Many around the world are limiting car usage and beginning to use other sources of transportation. Cars cause polution and tension to people everywhere. If citizens begin to limit car use and walk, bike or use public transportation instead, people will be much happier and the environment will be too. Citizens of America and Europe are already trying to cut down on driving and limit the excess polution to our environment. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" (Duffer, 14).

Cars cause a great portion of polution to our environment. If citizens of countries around the world limit car usage, then the envirnment we live in will become more safe and less poluted. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive ares in the United States,"" (Rosenthal, 5). Since most cars use gasoline and diesel, they are emitting poisonous gases into the air, this could cause smog. By limiting car usage there will be a positive outcome on our envirnoment. ""It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the envirnoment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" (Rosenthal, 34).

In Bogota, Columbia, there is a day set to be car-free, which allows millions to use sources of transportation other than cars. ""Millions of  Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,"" (Selsky, 20). By walking, biking, or using public transpotation citizens around the world and even in America, can get around using a car. When driving to work, you can encounter traffic jams, or wrecks, but by using a bike or by walking, you can bypass the stress. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Rosenthal, 3).

If fellow citizens around the world limit the use of cars, then our environment will be less poluted as well as, less stressful. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" (Selsky, 24). Even young people are limiting the usage of cars. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..."" (Rosenthal, 41). Take the initiative, and decrease polution and stress by limiting the use of cars.                                                                                 ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
80031EC3D9B6,"From small town suburbs to largely populated cities, car usage can drastically affect a community. In developed worlds, personal automobiles are an increasingly popular trend, and help people go about their day to day business. Many would rather drive down the street to a grocery store of job instead of walking there even though it is common knowledge that the pollution and other harmful emissions cars create is bad for the enviroment and the people living there. The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage?

Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Both of these articles explain how limiting car usage in a city can be benificial to both the city and its residents.

In addition, the United States in partaking in this quest for less cars as well. Article ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal shows us that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" It is possible that this is partially because of the recession; many Americans could not afford cars. Also, more center cities have made the ""suburbs less appealing and has drawn the empty nesters back in"".  If this goes on, scientists believe carbon emissions could greatly reduce and this will be extremely benifical for the enviroment. According to the Mr. Sivak's research, less and less people between the age of 16-39 have been getting licenses. More studies have concluded the same results, but only time will tell in this trend will continue. No matter the reason behind it, this example also demonstrates how limited car usage is benificial.

On the other hand, some believe that less cars is NOT benificial. In source four, it claims that the lowered amount of people driving automobiles will be harmful to the profits of the car industry. To further explain, ""companies like Ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves 'mobility' companies with a broader product range beyond the personal vehicle"". This, without a doubt, is to combat the loss of sales and encourage people to continue buying their products. However, thos is pretty much all there is on the negative side of limited car usage. For the rest of the community, this doesn't affect them and is in fact quite benificial.

Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F4A3A95F16D8,"There are many advantages to limiting car usage.  A few of these examples are that it is better for the environment because it reduces greenhouse gasses and causes less polution and smog.  Another advantage is car traveling is becoming less nessasary because of citys like New York and new and improved telecommuting methods.  Also, car usage is becoming less popular, this is because of ""no car days"" and people just not bothering to get a car or a license.

To begin with, when you limit car usage, it is better for the environment because off all the greenhouse gas reduction caused by not using as many cars and other gas producing vehicles as much.  For example, in source 1, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states that "" And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes....passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"".  50 percent is a large number to be taken up by cars alone, if we can reduce car reduction, we can reduce greenhouse gasses.  Another example of why car reduction is an advantage is because of the pollution and smog areas.  You can clearly see this being stated in source 2, by Robert Duffer, ""[The smog] rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""  If Bejing, were to do what Paris did, they too could reduce smog and pollution by car reduction.  Also, in Bogota, Columbia, they have no car days, to limit the amount of smog.  However, limiting car usage to better the environment is not the only reason of why it is an advantage.

Secondly, one other advantage of car reduction is because it is becoming less nessasary to own a car.  For example, as stated in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, New York, is starting several programs to use cars less, including car-sharing, skyrocket bridge, tunnel tolls, and bike sharing programs.  In that source, it also says that when someone stops using a car, for whatever reason, they find it unnesasary to continue using cars, mostly because some citys are becoming more centralized again, and it's becoming easier to walk to stores.  However, thats not the only reason that it's being less nessasary to own a car. Another reason is because of improved telecommuting methods.  In source 4, Mimi sheller is quoted while talking about how people don't feel the need to drive to see their friend, instead they use their phone or computer to communicate.  Another reason for limiting car usage is because it is becoming less popular.

Thirdly, a lot of citys are starting to have car free days, this is shown in source 3, by Andrew Selsky.  In cities like Bogota, Cali, and Valledupar, all in Columbia, they have ""Day without cars"" this is one example of cars becoming less popular because, even though it was raining, tons of people still participated.  Another example is in source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she says that her children, both of age to get a license and living where one might want a license, still have not gotten there license because they do not think it is nessasary, and they simply stay where they can walk, or ride bikes, or take the bus, or the subway.  Mr. Sivak has shown that the number of 16 to 39 year olds that have a license has significantly reduced.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car usage including it is better for the environment, it is becoming less nessasary, and it is also becoming less popular.    ",3,Car-free cities,Text dependent
F5F56C9CD530,"The usage of motor vehicles has been on a steady decline for the last several years.  More and more people are relying on carpooling and other means of transportation. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's articles, she discusses Vauban, Germany, where cars are forbidden and how the use of cars has been on the decline.  In Robert Duffer's article, he talks about Paris' issues with pollution and the ways it has been dealt with.  In Andrew Selsky's article, he talks about a program in Colombia when citizens use other means of transportation other than cars.  The perks of limiting car usage include less pollution, less traffic congestion, and improved safety.

The main culprit of pollution issues is car usage.  In Source 2, Robert Duffer says that ""Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France...""(Duffer 16) This is because of a tax policy that has a preference to this fuel.  Diesel fuel is a lot more harmful than regular gasoline, and if many people are using this fuel pollution rates will skyrocket.  Cutting down on these fuels altogether could create a less polluted environment.  In addition, cars cause 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and 50 percent in specific places in the U.S(Rosenthal 5).  This statistic is startling, since half of the pollution problems in the U.S are associated to cars.  By using other means of transportation such as the train or even carpooling, this number can be greatly reduced to a much smaller percentage.

With more cars, more traffic congestion occurs.  A sign of this congestion is evident when Rosenthal says""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities.(Rosenthal 37)""  A lot of people are still using their own vehicles to get from point A to B, and as a result their is more money that has been given to toll bridges because of that.  The encouragement of governments to suggest car-pooling services and shared rides will decrease the revenue that comes from tolls.  If everybody shared a ride with a person from work or from somewhere else, there would be a great decrease in traffic congestion.

Furthermore, public transportation such as the BART in the San Francisco Bay area has decreased the amount of drivers on the road.  Although the rides are typically longer than driving a car from point A to B, it is a more efficient method of transportation.(Rosenthal 40)  Using these alternate methods of transportation decreases the amount of cars on the road at once.  With less cars on the road at once, there is more efficiency in getting where you need to go.

Safety is one of the most important aspects of reducing the amount of cars. In Colombia, a program promotes the use of no cars one day per year.  Many of the citizens use alternate methods of transportation such as walking and riding bikes.(Selsky 20)By promoting this, there are obviously less cars on the road and a lesser risk of people being injured by cars.  With programs that promote other modes of transportation, many lives can be saved since there would be fewer cars on the road.  Although many people require cars to get from place to place, the idea of lives being saved is something that shouldn't be ignored.  Also, technology has aided the decline in cars. Telecommunication has helped people become connected to friends and family in a way without meeting with them face to face.(Rosenthal 35) Because of this,  people dont have to travel to meet with their friends and family.  This has created a domino effect; people can communicate through social media and texting which causes less cars to be on the road to visit other people and overall causes less safety isssues.

In conclusion, cars are the focal point of many issues in our society.  They cause many safety issues such as traffic accidents,more traffic congestion which causes increases in revenue in tolls, and pollution issues.  By reducing car usage, many of these problems can disappear, and can create a safer and healthier environment.            ",5,Car-free cities,Text dependent
B3C35FE7E3B3,"In today's world, many of us see cars as a necesarry tool used to get us where we need to go in the shortest time possible. However, what many do not realize is how much restricting our usage of the personal automobile will actually help society in the long run. Decreasing our usage of the car will not only cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, but will also improve congestion and see an a boost in the economy of cities and countries around the world.

There is no doubt that cutting down on driving will greatly reduce the emission of grennhouse gases. As detailed in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, the effect of just one day of reduced driving played a signifigant impact on the amount of smog in Paris, France. The smog which covered the city of Paris rivaled that of Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. The cause of the intense fog is thought to be diesel fuel, which is the most commonly used type of automobile fuel in France. Because of this, Paris has a very high smog concentration compared to other Western European capitals. The temporary ban on driving drastically improved the conditions in Paris, and the ban was lifted after only one day. If this idea of reducing the use of automobiles spreaded to other car-dependent countries such as the U.S., there is no telling how much the impact of society on the emission of greenhouse gasses will reduce.

Additionally, the increasingly popular idea of favoring walking or biking over driving to one's destination has seemed to have a signifigant impact around the world. In the passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the capital city of Bogota, Colombia has participated in the Day Without Cars program for three straight years. This has led to an increase in the creation of bicycle paths and cut down on congestion and traffic jams normally common in the city. In addition, the uprising of parks and recreation centers has also helped to boost the city's economy. However, this program has not been restricted to Bogota, as many people from countries around the world have come to see the event. This has the potential to become an internationally now phenomena, which will greatly improve the health and well-being of the people of the world. New bicycling opprotunities will mean no longer getting in traffic jams and will reduce stress and congestion in the long run.

In conclusion, the limiting of car usage would have a profound impact on our society, not only on pollution and the envorinment, but on our personal well-being. The limiting of our dependency on cars has had a great effect on the emission of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, and smog has the potential to be removed from modern cities all together; the economy would also benefit, as fewer cars means fewer roads needing to be built and an increase of bicycle trails, parks, and shopping centers in walking distance of neighborhoods. Overall, the limiting of car usage would have a fantastic impact on society and our world as a whole.    ",4,Car-free cities,Text dependent

We are having a movement where cars aren't needed, it's a slow process were you won't see the result until you compare back then to now. This change is happening due to people living a more active life, and minimizing global warming in small ways that have big results.

Living a life were your life does not center around a car is not something you would expect to have such great results, but, it does people are genuinely happy that they aren't driving cars. Not having a car has given so much relief and less tension to people, knowing that they are active and getting from point A to point B while doing it.

We have so much pollution going on and one of the biggest causes of it is cars.

For these countries they felt that this was a great idea to stop their smog and pollution problem.

That's why right away when Luke heard that they are hiring Seagoing Cowboys, he couldn't say no. It was a opportunity of a lifetime!

As soon as Luke got hired, he was so excited to start working. He worked and worked all the time. He wanted to be the best Seagoing cowboy there has ever been. Sometimes he would work more than he was soppost to. He enjoyed taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules.

I did things I didn't know I could do. I got to see amazing places and do amazing things. Even if I didn't have anything to do with the animals, me and my fellow cowboys played lot's of games and had tournaments.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy also made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It made me realizie that I am helping lot's of people. I am helping people have food to eat. This awareness stayed with me, this led my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Some other people think it is dangerous to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I do think that sometimes it can be dangerous. That is why there are multiple people on the ship so they can help you when you get hurt, or can take over your job so you can heal.

My days as being a Seagoing Cowboy were amazing. I had lot's of fun and helped lot's of people. I hope that lot's of other people will have the same experiance that I had.          ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
DA02B96721FB,"Splash, splash, splash what do you think of that sound every night just before you go to bed. This is what the Seagiong Cowboys hear every night. Caring for animals all day on a boyt can be very hard work, but it is alway fun and intergetic work. It is the most exciting adventure you could ever do in your life time, so just try it. When I first heard about the trip it was like th emost amazing thing ever.

Never before in my life had anything seemed so great. The trip wass fantastic, just all the scenery and things you saw. You get to meet and be with other Cowboys. You learn to trust and like to be with animals. It just so I would really advise you to at least try it and see how you like it at sea for so long.

You get pulled in right away whoever you are old or young. There are games such as table-tennis tournaments,fencing, boxing, and the cowboys also play baseball and volleyball in the stalls where there aren't any animals in. You could also read, or wittle to help pass the times when you didn't have anything to do. You aso have a lot of oppertunities to do diferent jobs aound the bout.

When I was on my second round giong along with the Seagiong Cowboys I surved as a night watchman. When you get this job you have to go around every hour and check on the animsls and see if they are all right. While diong this I slipped and fell which was a scarey thing because I wa sheaded strait for the edge of the bout. Lucky me I was caught and only had a brocken rib.

You can also become a very well know person if you do oit right. I am so thankful I went to help, as I said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" I have helped so many international students and and exchange visitors for years. This trip has made my life such a bliss since I agreed to sign up for that trip to take care of the animals while they get shipped across the ocean from place to place and to time.

As I have been telling you just try to and juust see how you like it. When I came oout of high school I was working two part- time jobs and had a best freind named Don Reist. When he came up to me and askekd me if I would do it I couldn't say no. I knew this would be my only chance in a life time. So why don't you try this, or if you don't like it tey something else. Just just do what your heart tells you to do, and be happy.  ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

In this story He will tell you in his point of veiw. How he feels about the program and why he would want to join. Personally I think I would join from the sounds of it. I think he loved it and the opportunity was great because he took it and you might end out just like him.

Second , I think that you should join the program because you can go on amazing adventures. And you might travel by water day and night. I bet you can even have lots of fun in europe. And by adventures I mean going through the ocean and climbing mountains. When you travel on water you will go on boats and cross oceans.""Let us say that you can go to europe to florida to england. Yeah thats how fun it is see that's why should join.

Third, another few reasons you should join is because. You might even see whales, dolphins and fish and I know some people love to eat fish with fishing poles. And you should join because you don't know you might even make new friends. I personally love to fish because you discover new fish and if you want you can eat them. So those are the reasons for you to join this program.

In conclusion, I am trying to persuade you to join. Well I did the best I could do to persuade you. I hope you deeply consider it. It's Lots of fun and you will go places you dreamed of going. See I know some people get sea sick so I am not forcing you to go but I hope you will take the opportunity to get out and have fun everyone!",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
DFB662FD0C42,"The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great idea. There are a lot of reasons you should join I will give you some reasons. This really should make you want to sign up right after you read it.

You are helping innocent people who servived any war, because it was left in ruins. Anyboby who joined got to go around the world for free to help people. If you have some free time you could even go sight-seeing. You could just see the happiness on an innocent child or adult to lighten your day up. If you like animals you could be around them all day long.

Luke once said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acroplis in Greece was special,"" he aslo said . "" So was taking gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."" Luke got toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal while he was on his way to China.

If you go it's not like your the only person on the boat with a whole lot of animals. You can even have some of your friends sign up with you and that is even better. Just think of it like your on a boat with a lot of every people getting ready to help people. Every one else on the boat can become your friends so it's not just you and some strangers it's you a whole lot of your friends.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to travel all over Europe. I made nine trips to different countries and had extra time to tour famous sites such as the Acropolis in Greece and

I took a gondola ride through the watery streets of Venice, Italy. You'll be able to go to Italy and Greece too, but you will also be able to go to China and Panama.

The job of a Seagoing Cowboy is very safe and will most of us will likely return to our families after our war service is up or we retire. A Seagoing Cowboy also dosen't have to fight on the battle field during wars. If they are drafted, they just pay their service by doing their job like i did.

We also did many fun activities in our spare time. Us Cowboys play baseball and volleyball. We also had table-tennis tournaments, we fenced, boxed, read, and we played many other games. Not only do we do these activities, but we also liked to whittle.

One of these responsibilities is that we all took turns nightwatching. What a nightwatcher does is they have to check on the animals every hour and make hourly reports to the captain.

2AEF9CECD887,"A Seagoing Cowboy's Journey

Imagine going to many sites that many people don't normally see and having mulitple adventures around the world. It is an unforrgetable experience that you don't want to miss. You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program becasue of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and seeing the unquie sites.

First of all, having some freetime and playing some games onboard is simply a time to relax and enjoy the great experience. Many of you may say that the games don't matter. You just want to travel the world and save as much people as possible. Even though that may be true, I belive that the games benefit in many ways, like making new friends and just having some tine to relax. The cowboys and I have played baseball and volleyball in some empty holds where animals have been housed. Other things to do in your freetime could be reading, boxing, whittling, table-tennis, fencing, and so much more! It has helped me have a better time onboard.

Secondly, helping struggling individuals and families make you feel joyous inside. Some people may say that you don't want to help as many people and go enjoy the amazing sites and play games with fellow companions. And, helping people is really dangerous. But, I belive that if you do, it can make you a better person inside and out. And it doesn't just have to be people either; it can be animals too. Caring for the animals on the way to China kept me busy which was a good benefit because the trip to China took about a month. They had to be fed and watered two to three times a day. It helped me be more responsable and hard working. As for the struugling people, I helped people recover their food supplies, animals and more. The benefits were that same as those with the animals. The knowladge of helping someone or something is one of the best feelings in the world.

Lastly, touring the sites was the best thing for me to experience. Multiple people might say that they don't care about the sights and they just want to do something else. But, I believe that if I didn't see those wonderful sights, I wouldn't be determined or encouraged to finish my job as a Seagoing Cowboy. It was an unbeliveable opportunity for me and it will be for you. I was able to see Europe and China! Two things that were special to me were seeing the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. In Italy, many of the streets are water, which made my experience to Italty even more exciting. On the way to China, I also marveled at the Panama Canal and toured an excavated castle in Crete.

In conclusion, you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and finally, exploring the unquie and wonderful sights around the world. I am very grateful for the amazing opportunity and it made me more aware of people and their countire's needs. You should think about participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program today!

Well here are my reasons you would get to vist unique places and experience adventures and the excitment. This shows why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

To begin with, visting unique places has its fun of its own. When traveling many cowboys will play games to pass the time. The unique places are amazing you would go to the pacific ocean. In the text it states ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water"". The text also states But seeing the Acropolis Greece was special.""This shows unique places that the Cowboys have gone.

Second, . There is so much to explore and to the adventure were long and tiring. In the text it states that ""It took about two weeks to crosss the Alantic ocean from the easterncoast of the United States and a month to get to China"". The text also states that ""Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. The excitment with adventures comes with bravery. This shows adventures that the Cowboys have gone through.

33EE11660299,"Hi, name is Luke and I am part of the Seagoing Cowboys program. Many people don't conclude the idea of joining the program, but there are many reasons why you should join this program. I crodded the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice. At first i knew nothing about this program until my friend invited me and now, im glad he did because it was an adventure to never forget.

You get to go on adventures, and visit unique places such as Europe, China, sail across the Atlantic Ocean, and visit Greece. During these adventures you meet new people, see new cultures and how people live. You also help people around the world. When I help people in need I feel good inside knowing that im helping and making a difference in the world. Also we found that we could have fun on the ship, we played baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games that fullfilled our time.

Overall, I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy club for these reasons. You feel like a better person by helping people, you see the world and different countries, you go on adventures, and have fun while doing this by playing games and doing hobbies. Why would anyone take up this once and a life time opritunity? This adventure was very rememberful and fun so I think you should join the program and experience the remberable adventure yourself.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
FFEF92A66D05,"I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. You get to do so many amazing things. I have a lot of fun doing it myself and I think everyone else can too! I have had great new adventures in this program. I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it helps out others (including animals), you get to go new places with new people, and because it is a great opportunity.

My first reason on why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it can help out people in need.""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" That is one example that the program lets us help, not only just the people but also the animals too. I also found ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them."" That is one reason why people should join this program.

Another reason people should join this program is because you get to go new places in the world, for example I went to Greece! ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" Also another piece of evidence is ""So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy; a city with streets of water."" This is another example of why new people should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

An example is because it is a great opportunity for people. You get to do so many new things with new people. "" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger."" Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an eye opening experience for me. I also found in the text is states

""It opened the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says."" This program is a great experience and adventure. I know I couldn't pass down the opportunity once it was handed to me. The article says ""Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.""

These are just a couple reasons why I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. It can help others and animals. It is a great time you will have with people and with all the new places you can see and explore. I had fun with this program and I think a lot of otherr people can too. So once again this is why I think people should join the Seagoing Cowboys.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

First, I will talk about how becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would not only benefit you but also benefit other people in countries that had been damaged from the wars.

The main reason Luke had joined the Seagoing Cowboys program was to help other people that lived in countries that had been involved in the wars. Luke joined the program to help them recover and Luke had said ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Luke had been talking about the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Luke got to travel the world and meet new people from different places. It exposed Luke to the needs of countries and that was one thing Luke learned while being a Seagoing Cowboy. Finally, I will discuss why it would be a good idea to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy had been hard work but it also had many benefits. Luke not only helped others but learned something about other people in other countries. Luke had many benefits from joining the program such as helping other people in different countries, having a fun time with other people, and meeting new people. in conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy could benefit anybody.",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
AD0115C891C5,"I just graduated from high school , my name is Luke Bomberger.

I work two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. My best friend works with me , his name is Don Reist. I was working when Don invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Why wouldn't I say yes , I mean it's a lifetime thing so why not go? World War I I

Was over in Europe many countries wear left ruined or tone apart.

Many animals where stuck with no home or food. The animals had no one , nobody feeder them. UNRRA hired ''seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the young cows , horses , and mules

That got shipped over sea. Once Don and I heard about UNRRA we wanted to sign up , so we did. We really need more ''Seagoing Cowboys''. The amazing thing about working and helping these animals is seeing the happiness on there face.

Come join Don and I , I'm telling you it is very joyful.

You would get to travel on the boat maybe even see some

Tourist , or maybe you would be able to see the places we are going. Don and I have made some trips to Greece , castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

It would be a great , you would travel around the world seeing some amazing places , while helping animals and seeing the joy on there face. Who wouldn't want to be helping in the UNRRA.

23AA5F45C05B,"Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more of a different world then an adventure! This program helps you think of the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this fun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you off after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! Trust me. We all need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program!

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great oppertunity to help those in need to recover their food supplies. Doing this can help you be more aware of the people in need and help you know that you have been great help to them. This program hires men to take care of the horses, cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. This can make you come closer to the animals and let them know that you care very much for them!

Not only can you help, but this job does inquire some fun! You have the benifit to see and tour special landmarks and places that you have never seen before! It is quite an adventure! It is an unbelievable oppertunity to see all kinds of sites (especially on the job!).

On board, you can also find time to have fun! When you are on return trips after the animals are unloaded, you can play many games such as baseball, volleyball, and table-tennis in the empty holds where the animals stay. Fencing, reading, whittling, fun games, and boxing make some boat trips exciting!

Overall, taking part in the seagoing Cowboys program is an excilent oppertunity! It is more of a new world rather then just an site-seeing adventure! Taking part in this activity would make you feel better about helping not just your community, but citizens beyond your community, too! Helping those who need your support is quite the heroic thing to do!   ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

First of all I think you should sign up for this program because its alot of fun .Can you imagine traveling while helping others ? If you sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see all types of sights . In the passage Luke got to go to New Orleans , and Greece which shows you that you get to travel to awesome , mouth dropping sights. The passage states that Luke says ""

the cattle-boat trips were an unbelivable opportunity for a small-town boy "" which shows that this is not a waste of time . So you have alot of fun , get to see amazing sights , and its not a waste of time so why not sign up .

Second of all do you see how much help and care your giving . In the passage Luke cared for animals during the crossing , he fed them , and cleaned after them . Luke also severed as a night watchman for the animals , which means he was being on gard for the animals . Him watching over the animals effected people by them not having to worry about the animals . Luke also made hourly reports to the captain , while he was doing this he was also having fun . So Luke helped alot while having fun , why not join today .

Third of all you are doing your part . Everyone has a part to play , and everyone has to help in something . Luke stayed up late to watch animals and gave reports to the captin , Luke made his mark on the world and he didnt expect anything back , but he did get something he got to see mind blowing sights , meet new people and animals , and the satisfaction of knowing that he helped .

4122443C74C6,"I want others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is a fun experience, it helps out animals, and you get to travel to many countries and see the many sights.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways. One way is all the places that you travel to. I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.

Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways. One way is that it can keep you busy is when you are caring for the animals during crossing. They have to be fed and watered three times a day. What helped me prepare for hard work was when I would help on my Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Also I would serve as a night watchmen, which meant I had to check on the animals every night. Once I almost died doing that job one rainy night. As you can see, taking care of animals can be hard but also fun here at Seagoing Cowboys program.

My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights. I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies. Cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and have been on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, the city with streets of water. As you can see in the first paragraph, where it also shows I have been to many other places. In conlusion, you can see that traveling a one of the most fun parts of beingin the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Throughout the whole story, you can see that in the Seagoing Cowboys program, it is a fun experience, it helps animals, and you get to travel a whole lot. Those are some of the reasons that I would like others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.          ",4,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Seagoing Cowboy. He saw a lot of stuff on the boat as you can tell on paragraph 5 he said, ""Besides helping people,I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" That would be a great experince for a small town boy. I think it was a great idea to join the program because, you could tell your grandchildren about all the things you have seen and done. If his friend had not been there to tell him about it he would have been working two jobs his whole life. Luke is probably very greatful.

Luke is also the best there because he has went threw the route nine time as you see on paragraph 6. Luke point of veiw would probably tell more about what he saw during the trip and what he did. He loves to help people by this job he has helped bring all the cattle/food. Luke is very talented for having this job because you have to feed the animals about three times aday and keep them alive. You can state this information on paraghraph 6 and 7. He worked so much he got hurt and craked his ribs. He was happy to be alive. Therefore he had to stay at home to get better.

Luke's point of view would also tell how fun it was to work there and he would convince you that it is a realy good job. He was very happy to get this job beause he said, "" I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Luke created history and when he could not do the job any more people visited him all the time like students and many familys to live on all the history he made. It opened up Lukes world up when he got the job. Its also so cool how they played sports when they had free time to take the time away.

One reason people should join is because they get to see the world over. You can look at many different landmarks different while helping people at same time. I know that if you join this program you have many responsibilities, but you will have time to look around at least see the sights. Luke Bomberger, a man who joined the

Seagoing Cowboys, was able to go see many Europe and China such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, an excavated castle in Crete, and Panama Canal on his way to China.

Another reason why you should join is because you'll usually never be bored. There will always be something to do on the ship. Going back to Luke Bomberger, he stated that he fun on ship after animals were unloaded. They played baseball and volleyball in empty holds were animals used to be. They also did table-tenis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games as well.

Final reason to reason to join is you'll be helping many people who are in need. If don't know already, many people in different countries don't the items need for survival, and they need them desprately. As a Seagoing Cowboy you'll be providing them many animals that can give them those items.

Like I said, for a small town boy like me, sailing around the world is an opprotunity of a life time. There was no way I was going to turn down something like that. On my first trip I turned 18 years old and as you probably know, I would have had to join the military.

As you travel to theese far away places you also haft to take care of animals along the way.

Caring for theese animals willl sure keep you busy, but it is quite easy all you do is feed them, water them, and clean stalls. This experience is also good with connecting with people on the ship.

One can achive information that they did not know. We have seen and experience many sights of wonders, such as riding a gondola in Venice, Italy, we have toured a excavated city in Crete, and marveled the Panama Canal to China. These sights were amazing to see and experience. One should sign up so that they can do adventures that they may not be able to do in their area.

There are some down sides though. It takes a while to get to these resort, but it is worth it. It took us about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean to reach China. On our ship we have many objectives to keep ourselves busy; including: feeding our animals, night guarding, and cleaning stalls.

EDB3E229D251,"MOO! There are many animals a seagoing cowboy has to care for and deliver.

I Luke Bomberger was asked by my friend Don Reist to try out the program. Being a seagoing cowboy is a lot of fun, you can do a lot of things as one. You help people in need by giving them things they need. There are many reasons to join the seagoing cowboy program.

I started out by heading to Greece, and I turned eight-teen. I was old enough to be drafted then, but when my draft board figured out I was on a cattle boat they said to keep doing it as my draft service. When I was discharged I had made nine trips. I had went to Europe and China when I was a seagoing cowboy. I had fallen once, but I didn't go overboard. During your trips you have to care for the animals, by feeding them and giving them water.

When you're not working, you can do many things, like play games, read, and even fence. You can also see some places off the boat. When I was little I used to help out on my aunt's farm. It helped prepare me for being a seagoing cowboy. I had a lot of fun being a seagoing cowboy, because there were so many things to do.

You should be a seagoing cowboy, because you will be able to care for many animals, and you can see other countries. You can also play games to pass the time between trips. Being a seagoing cowboy would be the time of your life. You could help others while having fun yourself. It is a great program that helps others.

There are many reasons to join the program, like the ones I just mentioned. You can spend your time having fun, or you can just try it out to see if you like the program. You might end up how I started, by trying it out and end up liking it. You should join the program, because it helps people in need. In the future there might be other programs like this one.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
2BE4741F0CF6,"The problem we have at hand here is whether or not we should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. My thesis is we all should join the program and help everybody ravanged by the war. It helps a ton of people get better and it also gives you a good gut feeling that everybody loves to have. In the following text I am going to give you some of the reasons why we should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program and help other people.

My first reason we should all go into the Seagoing Cowboys program is you get the wonderful oppertunity to help other people. The people you will be helping have had there homes destroyed by war and all of their personal belongings including food, water, and any gifts they might have gotten. Think about the smiles and tears of joy when you arive at these peoples' houses bearing gifts of food and animals to keep them stocked up on food.

My second reason we should all join the Seagoing Cowboy program is you get to see all of breathtaking sights as you travel the sea on a boat. These places you will be going to will have a ton of awesome sight seeing spots on the way to enjoy with all of the other Seagoing Cowboys. Also once you drop off all of the animal you can do a lot of really fun stuff with all of your buddys. For example vollyball, baseball, and a lot lot more cool activitys and games.

In the Seagoing Cowboys program it is dangorous and I will give the other side who do not want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program that. I bet if you are saying it is dangerous and it is not worth the risk that you have never tried to help a lot of people before. When you help a lot of people you get the amazing feeling that by risking your one life you probably just saved a hundred more lives just by going on a month to two month trip from the spot you are in to the spot you are going.

In conclusion you should all join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a great oppertunity to help other people that have lost their homes and to see a lot of breathtaking sights that you would not normally get to see. It is dangorous but you can see all of the joy and relief that you are giving to the people who have suffered great loss do to the ravanging way the war has treated them. I know that if you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys that you could be the thing that people in other countries dream of coming the next day with the gift of savour for them and their familys.",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

Speaking of fun, you also have time to have fun onboard. You can play table-tennis onboard, volleyball, boxing, reading, whittling, and even more! You would mostly play these games on your way back from unloading the animals because you would have no more animals to take care of.

Many people know, and many people don't know about the Seagoing Cowboys.

In the ecxerpt, Luke was one of these.

Seagoing Cowboys are for anybody and everybody.

In this paper, there will be many details describing why Seagoing Cowboys are for everybody.

There are many details to describe the greatness of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

One detail is because if you are one of these people, than you get to take care of a bunch of poor animals.

A few of these animals are horses, young cows, and mules that are being shipped overseas.

You would also take care of people.

Some things that they would do are help their food suppliy animals and more.

Not just for the people, but for the countries that were left in the ruins.

Another detail is that you get to have a great time while you do it.

Luke for enstince, got to hang out with his other cowboys and have fun.

They would play base ball, vollyball games, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games.

They did these things to help pass some time.

The would also sometimes be able to go sight seeing.

Some people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is dangerous.

Well, there not completly wrong.

Although being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun and adventurious, it can also be dangerous.

In the ecxerpt, on Luke's second trip he had to be a watchman.

On one rainy night, he slid down the wet slippery ladder onto his back.

He shot feet first toward an opening on the ship.

Luckly, there was a small strip of metal on the edge which stopped him from ragging vigourusly into the wet and dark Atlantic Ocean!

After that he couldn't work for a couple of days because he had a few broken ribs.

Yes.

Everything in the paragrapg above is true, although, this only happens every once in a blue moon.

In the excerpt this didn't happen to any other of Luke's cowboy buddies.

So yeah it can get a little rough out there, but it only happens very rarely.

People have alot of fun joining this program and they always have a good time while they are here.

As one can see joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is for anybody and everybody.

It Is an amazing and exiting feeling once you know that your helping animals and helping people affected by World War ll.                                      ",3,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
43391E7ECDB6,"In a Cowboy who Rode the waves , the author talks about the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only does this program help victims , but it can save many cities that would soon start a war. Luke went over the Atlantic Ocean 16 times to help WW2 victims and help their community grow and rebuild their city. There are more than 1,000 victims in each world war that happens and just imagine how many animals were killed too.

One way you could join the Seagoing Cowboys would be to simply sign up for it, since Luke claims that he just signed up ,as stated in the text. You could also join the UNRRA and get the opportunity to get to choose every branch that could help victims in need. Even though Luke signed up to help the Cattle boat, he got to go sight seeing in China, Acroppolis , Venis,Italy and the Panama Canal.

Out of all of the time, Luke was on the Cattle boat , but in the text it states that he did the same things on his Aunts farm, but did not help him at sea. One day a bad storm hit and he landed by the animal pens and landed on a pice of metal , he could not work for a few days because of his broken ribs. He was happy to be alive but when the animals were shipped the crew would play lots of fun games. He had done this 9 times to and from where they were getting dropped off at. Also, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times.

After doing this job he helped get awareness of everything and why other people needed to join . He helped most victims with getting a new home and rebuilding their city. Luke enjoyed doing this job and loved playing with the crew after the animals were loaded. For Luke this was more than a job. After all he had to have a little adventure , right?

In conclusion , Luke loved his job. It was as it was all an adventure. The text states that it opened a new world to him. After that he raised more awareness. All i know is that he will , Survive !",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent

You are wondering what the Seagoing Cowboys are, right? Well it is a group of people who get together and help all over the world with taking care of animals that would would typically would would find in a barn.

What we do is they take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. It is a fun thing to do because you can be helping animals but also see all over the world and get to see cool and new stuff! Chances are you most likely haven't been to most place we go to.

I remember one time we had to ride a cattle-boat. people were alittle mad that they had to ride on a cattle-boat with a bunch of cattle. We were on a cattle-boat trip. It was pretty amazing and we also got to see Europe and China! People started to lighten up after they founf out that we were going to two wonderful places! It was the best trip we've ever been on!

Usually it takes about 2 weeks to get to the place we want to go. That's because we take a boat and sometimes we run into some bad weather, but if you just relax an denjoy it it will go by super, super fast! The bad weather can be bad that is why we have to take as much protection as we can! So, if you do join the Seagoing Cowboys make sure you have the right gear and you dress for the weather. Sometime it can be very cold when we are on the boat and then it can be SUPER hot when we get to our destination. Just make sure that you are always perpared and never not perpared!

If you get sea sick or homesick easy then it is not a good idea to join! If you get sick when we are there then you can't go home you have to stay with us at all times! So, it might be a good idea to bring stuff tha helps you feel better. It might be smart to bring medicine with you so you do not have too buy it somewhere else where it is expensive.

This would also be a fun and creative program because you get to do cool thing like watch dolphins and fish and all of the other sea creatures swim.

Seagoing Cowboys help animals, mostly horses, donkeys, cows, and mules, that are being shipped overseas to avoid harm get to their destination. Are you thinking that you maight like being part of this program? Here are some other good things about being a Seagoing Cowboy.

As I said before, you can help animals that are in danger and get to know them. This gives you a good feeling of helpfulness and compassion. I love to save lives, especially if they're animals'. I also liked to be freinds with them. Even though there are many other people on the boat with you, the creatures all have their own personalities, and this makes them fun to hang out with.

Another good thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see the world. I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and an excavated castle in Crete. I have been to Europe, China, and Italy. You can go to all of these places, see these sights, and more if you join their program.

Fianlly, there are so many people on the boat with you that it is impossible not to make a friend and have fun almost every day. I have made ample new companions. There are also many games played on the ship. They include baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, reading, boxing, and whittling. As you can probably tell, these are all exciting to do with your buddies.

Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.

Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant he could be drafted for the army. His draft amnagement company had learned he was in the seagoing cowboys, and they told him to keep doing what he was doing, because it was a form of help.

Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.

This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 he could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard he was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,""he says.

I also took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city filled with water and finally I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marvleled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Some other reasons are that you get to sleep in a boat you don't do that very often. Finally on return trips after the animals have been unloaded you play games. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals were. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

But being one is more gratefull for me than an adventure. It opened up the whole world to me. ""I am gratefull for this oppurtunity"" I say ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

But being a Seagoing cowboy has some dangers. This is during World War Two so enemy soldiers could be roaming around. Or also when i was on the boat. I was a watchman.

A6103F6D2AA5,"Here are some reasons people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You get to move cattle,travel places,help people.

Traveling would be fun and here are some reasons why. Places, you could go to asia and see their art, or Europe and meet the people. Food, you could try exotic things like goat or fresh Polish sausge. People, you could meet new people and hang out with your new best german buddy eating goat.

Moving cattle would be fun ecpecially if you grew up doing it just like Luke did. You could get smarter by doing this you would know how much of what to give a horse or a cow for feed, and you would know how to clean a stall. If you ever retired you could go into cattle from this experience.

If you did this you could have the experience of traveling and cattle but the best one would be knowing you helped all those people stay alive milk and meat from the cows meat from the goat. everyone would love you for giving them food and milk to eat and drink to keep them alive.

In conclusion those are the reasons why people should become Seagoing Cowboys. It would benefit you and those people who need food and water.",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
FE40A50DF994,"My name is Luke Bomberger, and I just got back from an amazing trip from being a Seagoing Cowboy.

I got to help animals recover from World War ll, and this trip was an amazing, and beautiful adventure. This program is hard work, and I know that some people aren't interested in helping animals, or working hard.

But, this is a really good program that I want to tell you about.

Maybe by the end of this article you will be convinced to join this program with me.

What did I have to do on this trip you ask? I had to help animals recover from World War ll.

This was a fun job, because even though this was hard work the animals are fun to play around with. If you don't take this job those animals won't have any body to take care or play around with them.

I know some of you don't really care for animals, but what's better: watching you favorite Tv show or helping poor animals recover from World War ll ?

The animals are a great part of this experience, but do you want to know what I really loved about this trip? I adored all of the tourist attractions on my way to China, and the great experience this was.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable for a small-town boy like me.

Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

I loved the gondola ride in Venice Italy, it was beautiful to see the streets of water.

When I toured that excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China, it was amazingly beautiful.

I was bored with my high school job, so I took this job.

I was not bored anymore.

This job is a great job for someone who loves adventures, sand a hard working job.

I sure hope that this essay has convined you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because my arm sure is getting tired from all this writting.

Like I said in the first paragragh, work might not be for some people, or some people might not like animals.

But I am telling you this program is worth the work, with the amazing places you see, and sailing on a boat while taking care of animals.

Hopefully, you will join the Seagoing Cowboys program with me, and if you do this program it will open up the world to you, and you will be writting the next essay to someone.  ",2,"""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""",Text dependent
9.21E+13,"I think that you should particpate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because their are new things you could learn. Also joining the Seagoing Cowboys program changed my life.

You should join the program if you like going to new places or if you like trying new things. If you love going to new places then this is the program for you because you will get to see a lot of knew places you haven't been before. I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured excavated castles in Crete and marveled at the Panama canal on my way to China, But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Or if you don't like exploring places you haven't been don't worry because there are plenty of other things for you to do there like for instance when we leave the animals and are on are way back we play tons of games. Also you get to meet knew people there, so you would end up makeing tons of friends. Also a lot of times when people participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program they end up tying new things they would't normally try or that they haven't tried. Also joining the program helps build you into a better person because you're helping out with the animals. Another thing is that the cattle trips were amazing for a small-town boy like me. When you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you will learn to take care of animals. If you're a bit affraid of animals don't worry they won't bite, well they might bite, but only if you make them really mad. It takes alot to make them mad though, so you will be okay and you won't need to worry about anything.

Some people might just say it is a useless way to spend your time, but I disagree because a lot of good things could come from it. Like you could make a lot of new friends there or you and your friends could join the program together to spend more time with each other. who wouldn't want to spend time with there friends playing games like table-tennis tournaments, fencing, and boxing. Or you could just read to pass time if you really wanted to. If you joined the Seagoing Cowboys program I think you would have a lot of fun. If you can't sleep or you like sleeping late you could be the nightwatcher. A nightwatcher is a person who watches over the animals.

I'm greatful that I had the opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it changed my life for the better, if my friend Don hadn't invited me to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat then I wouldn't had signed up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I am so grateful that he took me with him to Europe.

If you get the opportunity to join the Seagoing Cowboys, I think that you should join the program. It really is a oppotunity of a lifetime, so you should say yes and step out of your comfort zone if you don't like things like that. You know it is good to try new things. If you do decide to join the Seagoing Cowboys program I hope you have a good time.

2D21E920F1B0,"I entered a program before called the seagoing cowboys how it all started though was because of my friend don reist. I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

I got to travel a lot to. So here is why I am asking you to join the program just like I did.

I know you probaby won't do it but I am just going to try my best to convince you so the first reason is since the (UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.) That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters. Another reason you should join is because you get to travel all kinds of places in the world ( Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the acroplis in Greece was special"". he says)which he is actually me. One more reason why is because (luke/I also found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass time.)

So there are 3 reasons that I wrote out of why you should be a seagoing cowboy and if your a girl I suppose you could be a seagoing cowgirl. Now I am not forcing you to but just convincing you and I hope that convinced you because all of it is really true.

I suggest u people too come out and help us out with the people who lost all of there resourses from World War ll. So if everyone come out to help us with these people we cn change there lives and our lives by helping them. Also I wouldnt be doing this with out Don he got me into all this and i just couldnt say no, and we have been doing this for a couple of months and we love it!

We can all help out by being a Seagoing Cowboy and when we are done with these events we have alot of extra time so we can visit places around where evever we are! For an example I toured an excavated castle in Crete and i view at the panama Canal on my way to China! So not all of what we do is boring we do alot of worthy things and fun things.

He had a good life and even better when his freind Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Right when they started to leave to europe world war 2 ended. They had arrived August 14 the day the pacific war ended.

Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece that means he could of maybe joined military. Luke said it took about 2 weeks to travel across the Atlantic Ocean. It took a month to travel to china from united states. There lucky because they had 335 horses on the cargo ship with enough food and hay.

Luke had to take care of all the horses it was his job. It was no big deal though when he was a little kid his aunt made him work on her farm to be prepared. Just in case he did work in a farm in future and look he is taking care of animals. On Luke's second trip he was a night watchman. All he had to do was check on the animals every single hour.

Luke loved being a Seagoing cowboy it was more than he ever wanted. He had some scary moments but you have to face some fear. He was very scared when he almost fell off a cargo ship but a metal peice saved his life.

You can help people that have these problems by bringing them food, water, building materials, and other items that they need for daily living. Helping someone always feels fantastic beause you know that you did the right thing.

Being over sea for so long with other people would mean that you would most likely end up being friends. With everybody being friends you would be able to have so much fun.

So, would anyone join me along my adventure across the oceans, seas, and rivers of the mysterious earth?

Scientists and astronomers are finding various ways to either put a human on the planet or send another spacecraft over to sit in the air longer than a couple of hours like the past ones that were sent.

First venus has a lot of flaws and conditions where humans wouldn't be able to outstand. In the text it states, ""On the planet's surface, tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit..."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus) No human would be able to outstand that burning tempature without some type of aircraft or special suit. Also in the text it states, "" and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus) You would just crush if you were placed on this planet. These condition are way more extreme than anything us humans have encountered.

Second, even though scientists and astronomers know how dangerous venus is and how terrible their conditions are, they are fascinated and want to learn way more about it. They believe venus is the most Earth like planet in our solar system. In the text it states. ""Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.""

The text also states, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.""

They strengthen their claim by describing the climate and dangers, differences in technology made to suvive it's conditions, and alternatives to exploring Venus.

The author of the passage first describes Venus. They describe how it's different from Earth and how that provides a challenge to NASA. The author brings in the atmospheric differences (such as what it's made of and the pressure), temperatures, geological, and weather differences. NASA has to take all of these into mind and adapt to it so they can explore the planet safely.

Since Venus is so different from Earth, NASA has to make vehicles that'll withstand the atmosphere and pressure of it.

The author explains how that could be a problem as well, seeing as how the blimp couldn't reach the ground to collect anything for NASA to study when they get back.

The author understands that NASA is working on alternatives to get closer to the surface of Venus so they can study it more.

That detail gives us insight on how close NASA is to safel exploring the suface of the sister planet.

Exploring the surface of Venus has become a big focus for NASA. The author wants to give us insight of how challenging and dangerous it is, but also how they're working on making it possible with different pieces of equipment that's stable eough for the atmosphere of Venus.

F2739E865E43,"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how fascinating Venus truly is and how there are ways of getting around the hazards involved. The author goes into detail about how Venus is so fascinating because it is our Earth's ""twin"". Although there are numerous safety hazards for the space travelers, NASA has developed many theories on how to get around it. With this he is able to support his view that studying Venus up close would be benefitial despite the dangers at hand.

Venus is one of the closest planets to resemble Earth in the entire solar system. The author states, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size..."" This is the author's way of introducing the idea that other planets in our solar system could have been able to harbor some form of life at some point. The author also states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author uses these excerpts in order to explain to the reader why there is such a fascination with studying Venus and why he supports it.

Venus has its fair share of deadly hazards including erupting volcanos, atomic pressure beyond what any human can stand, intense heat and many more serious hazards. The author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way...Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author includes this to show that although Venus has it's dangers there are ways to get around them, he does this in order to support ,or convince the reader, that studying Venus would be more important than the possible dangers.

In conclusion, the author supported his belief that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers excellently. The author explains that Venus could have once been exactly like Earth and even now Venus is the closest to resembling Earth. He explained that there are indeed many safety hazards but with NASA working on ways around these hazards, the trip would be worth it, even if it's just from a bird's-eye view.

877F6174E222,"The author uses connotations by suggesting that venus is a worthy pursuit is studying but the dangers that it has is that it's the hottest planet in the solar system and went through the greenhouse effect while is was being created. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets around it. The temperatures on average is around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has more powerful earthquakes,erupting volcanoes and frequent lightning strikes.

It says that NASA is working on approaches for getting to venus. Like for example,simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested through a chamber. A vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the ground but the surface would still be hot at around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Venus can sometimes be a good planetary visit. The planet has rocky sediments on its surface such as valleys,mountains and craters.

A phone or a tablet being exposed to acid could be heat capable to melting just imagine what that would be like. By comparing it with a system that uses mechanical parts the system can be made to be more resistant from pressure and heat resources. Many researchers cannot take gas or rock from a distance.

Also in paragrpah two it says that Venus and Earth are ""twin"". They say that planet Venus has the closest planet to Earth, but the density and size are some what close. It also say's that the speed of orbiting around the sun is close to Mars, and also Venus. Yet also Venus is very close to us that the humans have tried to send spacecraft to land on Venus numerous times. And yet each time was a fail since it only survived for a few hours.

Also in paragraph three it says that the atmosphere is very thick in Venus. That it has a 97 percent of carbon dioxide that covers Venus. Also the temperature is very extreme which is why we cannot live in Venus, even though Mercury is closest to the sun Venus is much hotter than Mercury.

Another reason is that Venus has a high pressure and also heat which states in paragraph three. Venusian geology says that Venus has erupting volcanoes, and very powerful erathquakes, it also has frequent lightning strikes that hits on the land.

Also in paragraph four it says Venus was probably coverd in largely oceans which can also supported the various forms of life. Yet also Venus does have some features of Earth, Venus has rocky sediment which includes valleys,mountains,and also craters. Also scientist say that to visit Venus it will take a long time frames of space travel, and also if you want to return form Venus it will be very hard.

Another reason on why Venus can be dangerous to study is that humans are having an idea on sending humans to Venus. Scientist are coming up with a solution have them float above the fray and not land. They are coming up with ideas of having a blimp like vehicle just hovering about 30 or more miles above the landscape. They may have a vehicle hovering over Venus so it could avoid the ground conditions for just staying off ground. The surface on Venus is around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure is close to the sea level on Earth which says on paragraph five.

552A6E7456E8,"Nothing like chilling in an 800 degree oven and having pressure thats 90 times greater than that on earth while studying a planet. Thats what it would be like to study Venus on its surface. But scientists want to some how find a way to study it, Safely. There are three big things that the author writes about in this article that may be a safe alternative or possobility to study Venus like floating above the atmosphere of venus, using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide, or using something called mechanical computers.

First things first the author talks about hovering above Venus's atmosphere to avoid all of the most of the dangers. High heat, crazy high pressure levels, Ect. The author of the article says, "" Just as our Jet airplances travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid all the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This is a safe alternative to landing on the surface because it takes away the problems that they have been having all together. But the problem he has with this is that the only things they can do to study it is observe they can't take samples of rock, gasses, or anything else. But it will get them a basic view of the planet nothing much more.

Another thing that the author stated may work is using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This will help because because of the type of material. The author states within the article, "" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" This is why it could help because it lasted three weeks where regular things couldn't even last 3 hours on venus without getting comepletly abliterated. So if they where made out of the silicon carbide they would be able to get it on Venus get samples of gasses, rock, and anything else they could find then get out of there before it gets destroyed hopefully.

The last thing that the author talked about that could work is using old technology called mechanical computers. The devises where envisioned in the 1800 and helped out in world war II. But the author says, "" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all."" This would help because of the fact they could get it on Venus and not have to worry about the electrical boards of the vehicle frying. Because there will be no Electric envoleved in the process. If they made it out of a heavy duty metal or maybe even silicon carbide it may allow it to work on Venus and get samples of gasses, rock, and anything else on the surface of venus.

The three big things that may allow the exploration of Venus to be a possability are floating above the atmosphere of venus, using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide, or using something called mechanical computers. These ideas could help visually see the planet close up, Get on the planet safely, and move around the planet and get samples of evidence. This would help out NASA in the great race of space with all the things that they could discover from the planet of Venus. So while we are sitting here on earth one day there may be a man in a comepletly different situation of being in extreme heat and pressure.

What he does not talk about well is the why. Why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Here is a part of the artical where the author talks about why it would be cool to study Venus. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,""(paragraph 4). The author mentions humans being facinated with Venus and how the planet was once Earth-like. This information does help us see how it would be cool to visit Venus and it tells us some information about Venus. On the other hand the author doesn't give a solid reason for why studying Venus is worth it and despite the risks. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,""(paragraph 8). The author does not tell us what the insight is that will be gained from exploring the planet. Also what does human curiosity leading us into other endeavors have to do with how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Their reason and support for studying Venus is weak. The author trys to use their own opinion to convince the readers that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The author aslo doesn't give a sound explanation as to how the danger of heat can be overcome for enabling the trip to be successful. ""Some simplified eclectronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions,""(paragraph 7). The author explains that there is a material that can survive on Venus for a little while. A problem to this could be that the metal might actually not work on Venus because since no one has ever been ther how would they know exactly what it is going to be like. That is why they are going there in the first place to explore Venus. They could have totally messed up on the calculations of surviving on the planet and it might be a failure. The pros of this mission are far less important than the cons to this mission. If they succed then they can say they know what on Venus and can gain some information. If they fail then people can die, a load of money is gone because of the time, energy, and resorces put into the exploration are gone.

The author does not support his idea well that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They only give a few reasons why the trip would be worthy. They use their own opinions as facts trying to pursuade the readers to agree with their ideas. They also don't fully explain how they can by pass the dangers involved with this exploration study on Venus.

32A121824D02,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet itself is dangerous. Venus is the same as the Earth, I mean it is reffered to as Earth's ""twin"", but there both the same only because of the density and size. Both planets do have the same shape and density, but planet Earth is much more safer than Venus.

Venus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. For example, in the text it says,"" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" It's impossible for somoene to even live on Venus because of it's own atmosphere.

Exploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it. People tried to study about the planet, people have tried to explore, but in the end, it ends up failing. For example, in the text it states, "" since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" This is explaining how bad the planet really is.

No spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus. The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself. For example, in the text it explains,"" the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees.

Venus is a dangerous place cause of the atmosphere, environment, and study of the planet.

There are many good reasons why NASA doesn't go to Venus. One is the atmosphere, Venus's atmosphere is ""almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide"" that goes complely around the planet. The most challening part is in Venus's atmosphere once you past the carbon dioxide is the ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid.""

Hot days are the best right, well on Venus the average temperatures are ""over 800 degress Fahreneit."" ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.""

Venus was most likely the planet to be very much like Earth a very long time ago, but even today Venus has some features that are the same as Earth's. For example, in paragraph 4, the text states,""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment an includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus may not completely be like Earth, but it has vey similar features. Scientist already know about some of these features, but there are probably a lot more similarities between the two planets.

Traveling to Venus would be very challenging and even possibly life risking, but scientists are sure there is a way.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the debate of the exploration of Venus is exposed for discussion. The article brings up many contriversal topics discussing whether or not Venus is worth exploring. Though most of the article talks about the dangers and overall negativities Venus has to offer when it comes of exploring it, the author takes this information and turns it into postives. The author demonstrates that although Venus is dangerous and almost impossible to explore, attempting to do just that willl be well worth it in the long run. Due to this, the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

In the article, the author first brings up the fact that Venus has a very toxic and dangerous atmosphere. They go on to say that because of this, the conditions in Venus are far to extreme for any human to survive in. Then, the author even posses the question of: Why are scientists trying to explore Venus more if it's so inhospitable? The author uses this question to transition into how they support the exploration of Venus, by saying how despite the inhospitable environment, Venus has many Earth-like qualities which intrigues many astronomers. In the article the author states, ""... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This shows that learning more about Venus could potentially be a great advantage to Earth since it's the most similar planet to Earth in the entire solar system.

A second problem the author states about exploring Venus is that every attempt to explore the planet has failed. One reason being is how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft to survive for more than a couple of hours on Venus's surface. In the article the author states, ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" The author contradicts this later in the article by explaining the technological advacements that NASA has accomplished to help prevent having another failed mission to Venus. The author states, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This demonstrates how even though Venus is about impossible to explore, technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet's surface.

Throughout the article, the author demonstrates that the postives of exploring Venus outweigh the negatives by giving strong evidence as to why the positives eliminate the problems when it comes to exploring Venus's surface. Although there are many major issues with exploring Venus, the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems. Not only does the author do this, but they show how Earth can discover and learn many valuable things about Venus that can help in the long run. So through very strong evidence about the positve that was able to outweigh the negative, the author was able to support the idea of studying Venus very well.  ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author says there are valleys, mountains, and craters. I think it would be nice if they could think of a way to explore venus but i dont know if that will happen because we might not be advanced enough.

The way that people can study venus is to stay above the surface in a blimp, they could build space crafts and rovers out of the strongest material on Earth, and they could also make a submarine like vehicle that is strong enough to with stand the heat and the preasure.

The fact that Venus is a planet that is close to us should make it easy to go to. It is not easy because of the preasure and the heat. A way to get around these issues is to make a blimp that will stay above the surface of the world so then it only gets part of the preasure and heat. Then they can try to get evidence and samples from the surface of the planet to bring back with them to study on earth.

They could get the strongest material on Earth and use it to make space crafts and rovers that will with stand the full heat and preasure. Then the rover could collect samples of gases and rocks. It could also get photographs and videos of what the surface looks like. It could then take everything back to Earth and then humans could study the diffrent samples it collected.

They could make a submarine like vehicle that can withstand the preasure. If they do that then they can collect the samples and figure out if Venus had life on it before. They could find out if Venus could become a new home for humans if it is needed. Then the submarine could send all of the evidence back and then we can study all the evidence we need to study to learn more about Venus.

In Counclusion, they need to make a vehicle out of the strongest material to send down to the suface of Venus and try to collect samples. Then the vechile will come back to Earth with the diffrent materials and then humans would get to work on studying the samples.             ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

In paragraph 2 it says that Venus is considered Earth's ""twin"". They say that because they are simlar in shape and size. The one of the differences they have is speed. In paragraph 2 it also states that, ""because Venus is sometimes right around the corner - in space terms - humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""

In paragrap 3 it says that, Venus has a thick atmoshpere of almost 97 persent and the layers are considered blankets. The clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The temperatures range up to 800 degrees fahrenhiet. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to. The pressure from that would crush a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest partof the ocean.

9B173EBFB406,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despit the dangers it persents, because he or she feels very strongly that there is more to Venus then we think. Many people think that Venus is a star because of the nickname it was given ""Evening Star,"" but it is really a planet. Venus is the second planet from the sun. From a distance we are safe but is has been one of the most challenging planets to examine closly.

The author thinks that Venus is worth learning more about because it is the most earth like panet in the solar system. It has shown signs of various forms of life, oceans, valleys, mountains, and craters. With these shocking findings many scientists will be wanting ti find out more avout the dangrous planet. Venus is an extreamly hard planet to acess safely. The atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and it coveres the entire planet of venus. The more challenging part of landin gon Venus id the cloud that are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. when you get to the actual part of the planet the temperatures avrage of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atnosphere is 90 tmes greater then on earth. To get there safely the only way would to hover about 30 miles over the planet.

Although studying Venus is a dangrous activity there are other soultions to getting there safely. Many scientists are working on finding a way to make the machines last long enough fo us to gather information and samples. Finding a soultion that will work for in the harsh ennviroment that Venus brings is going to be very diffcult. The scientists are going to have to extra hard to get something that can stand the conditons. The idea of studying such a dangerous planet can be a little unsettling, you have to know all the things that could go wrong and how to prevent them and you also have to be prepared for everything. The author thinks that studying venus is a good idea even though is is dangerous because he or she knows that there is more to it then we can see. For all we know there could be forms of life on there. Studying Venus will do good for the people working at NASA and all the other who study our solar system because it will bing in more information about things that have happend and why some things happen on earth today.

The article states that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imigination and innovation."" This quote from the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" sums up the whole point in which we should not let the diffculties get in our way of discovering more and more. Scientist want to explore and learn more about Venus not because they just want to but because it has value. Learning more about Venus will likely lead us to many more good things. Even though venus is a dangrous place to explore and study its worth a chance, there are so many good things that can come out of it.

The next thing is that the author said that Venus is the closest planet to the earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too. The next thing that the author puts in the paraghragh is that venus go around the sun in diffrent speeds then the earth. I think we should explore venus because venus might have the material that earth has not the second thing is that venus might have new creature that we never seen before that can with stand the conditions that venus has. The third thing is that venus never ben explord before so we might see thing we might not have seen on earth. The next thing I want to say is that we can use venus as a waypoint for space ships to go back and refule and get things to explore new planets but the conditons on that planet IN the paragragh it said that venus has sulfuric acid in the air is 90 time denst as the atmaspher on the earth.

3984A246E82F,"The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I think this for multiple reasons. Yes NASA may have a possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus which could allow scientists to float above the fray, but you don't know for sure if it would work or if you would make it back alive. Why take the chance? I know I wouldn't.

In the atricle the author states ""Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This would mean that you couldn't really experiment anything you find there and it would be pointless to even go to Venus. To be able to study Venus like they want they would need evidence and samples of different objects from there. The article also states ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standards forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This would mean that you would need to stay so far away and even when being that far the pictures or videos you would want to take could not be done. Also with additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface makes the chances more slim to surving on Venus for even a few short hours.

In conclusion, I would not say studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is the second planet from our sun which is why it's proved to be a very challenging place to examine more closely. Especially since no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. Trying to go to Venus would be pointless and not worth it. Not only are clouds in Venus challenging which are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, but a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

I beleive the author supports his idea that studying Venus would be a good idea very well. Although Venus is uninhabitable and dangerous for humans the author shares many solid facts that throughly support his claim. For example the author states in paragraph 4 that ""it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" The author also shares that Venus may have once supported forms of life. I beleive these two facts alone could spark interest in the reader and get him/her to want to know more about whats on Venus. In paragraph 4 the author also states that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. I beleive this fact supports the authors claim very well. Not only does the author provide facts that sparks the readers interests he also provides logical ways and evidence of how scientists can get humans to Venus. In paragraph 5 the author says ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" meaning NASA might be able to create a vehicle that can float above all the dangers of Venus.

I think the author has some valid details that support his claim, and it's enough to want to take a chance and know about our neighboring planet, Venus. I will be discussing the following, simplified electronics and mechanical computers to support the author's claim.

The author states that, ""NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus."" One of these approaches are the simplified electronics that were tested in a chamber that is supposed to simulate Venus' chaotic surface, and lasted for three weeks. Another approach is mechanical computers which, ""were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."" This device does not require electronics and they ""make calculations by using gears and levers."" Any regular, modern computer if exposed to acid or heat are capable of melting, as well as cell phones and tablets. This shows that devices that use mechanical parts can tend to be more resistant to such pressure, heat, and other forces.

I have concluded that though it is risky and dangerous to study Venus, I think it's worth knowing about it and it's contents. It's a great challenge for us humans but that is what makes it worth knowing about. What if Venus excedes our expectations and we find something that could possibly be life impacting?

Also,Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safety far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Mny researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough on Venus. An example that supports this is ""Therefore,scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

An explanation of the evidence of why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because,Venus is the hottest planet and it is difficult to understand the different despites of many risks. Also when simplified electronics that is made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and has lasted over for three weeks. An example that supports this is ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example,some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". One way Venus can not be worthy of despite of the dangers is by looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and can make calculations by using gears,levers,and do not require electronics at all. Also if you use a phone or tablet to acis or heat capable of melting tin,then those systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces. An example is ""Modern computers are enormously powerful,flexible,and quick,but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"".

Some ideas that show that Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the dangers when it is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth. also Venus is referred to Earth's twin. An example is ""These differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner"". Also,each previous mission was unmanned,and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. It also explains that the spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Long ago,Venus was covered largely wih oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth.

The scientiest have to study the planet so the people don't die or get hurt while on the planet of Venus. They would have to study the tempereture, air pressure, and the amount of carbon dioxide. In paregraph one it says ""Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actully a planet"". The planet is very hot with . the tempereture being around 800 degrees also 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus.

Venus air pressure is 90 times greater than what the experience on our own planet. In paragraph 3 it says ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"". Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system. Spaceships can't land on the planet for more than a few hours therefore they are trying to make some electronics made of silicon carbide.

The scientest are trying to test the silicon carbide electronic so that it can last on the planet of Venus for more than a couple of hours. In paragragh 7 it says""The silicon carbide electronic has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". There are older technology that are called mechanical computers. The device were first envisioned in 1800s. They also have played and important role in the 1940s during the World War II as a result the planet Venus is a dangerous place to study for humans to land on.

People would like to know about Venus, danger of it, and the testing for the spaceshuttles to land on. Venus is the second planet away for the sun and the first closets to the earth. The planet is dangerous for the spaceshuttles to land on because it is so hot and the air pressure is bad. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

If we're learning so much about the dangers of Venus then why even begin to consider to approach it in any way. Why not push it to the back of the line and continue to study Mars, a place where you can actually step foot on it's surface. Although Venus is shown to be extremley dangerous and risk taking, scientists can't seem to let it slip through the cracks.

Venus is made of about 97% carbon dioxide, has an atmosheric pressure of 90 times greater than Earth, and is considered dangerous but has yet proved to be worthy of studying. The author states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus has also been hypothesized that years ago it was likely that Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have even supported many different kinds of life. So despite the challenges the author sumarizes that because it resembles so closely to Earth it wouldn't make sence not to study it and try to rehinder all of the information they can from Venus.

So even though there are several factors that take play in the study of Venus it doesn't seem by the authors statements that they're stopping anytime soon. They will continue to advance their technology until they are able to explore it to the fullest.                  ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
505539572A50,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author does a good job of portraying how Venus is worth being studied despite its dangers. They talk about the different dangers in studying Venus, and they also talk about why it is so interesting and why it would be worth studying further.

The author shows this through the text because they clearly state why Venus is considered so dangerous and also why it is so interesting. For example, in paragprah 3, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide...clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid...temperatures average over 800 degress fahrenheit...atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" These are some examples of the dangers that are presented when trying to study Venus. Despite the dangers, Venus would be worth looking into because it provides new information and a greater knowledge of what environments are like on other planets, for example, in paragraph 4, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These are some examples of why we should look more into Venus because it has similar features to Earth and it is interesting to figure out why or how they are similar. The author proves their point by explaining that these dangers could potentially be worked around. In paragraph 7, ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons."" This is showing that while Venus may be very dangerous to observe, there are advanced technologies out there that can lower the risk that comes with studying this planet. As the author stated in paragraph 8, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagaination and innovation."" What the author is trying to get across in this line, is that we should not limit ourselves or limit how much we can know or see solely based on something being too dangerous, when there are innovations out there to make it possible.

These are some of the examples of how the author demonstrates his ideas on why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it presents. The author did a good job presenting his ideas, as shown in the text and examples provided.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
7BA86A61E948,"Is studying venus a worthy pursuit ? Venus is a worthy stuying pursuit because it has many challenges but it may have been earth like. In the beginning it talks about the plant being hard to examine up close and venus havingthe hottest surface. the middle talks about Venus once being a Earth like planet and the idea from NASA and machines that will let scientists float above the venus landscape. The end talks about silicone carbide being tested over Venus's surface.

Venus is a challenging place to examine because it is really close to the sun which makes it hard to examine. According to paragraph 1 it says "" While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vanatage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" Venus is a hard planet to examine because of how close it is to the sun. None of the spacecraft's have survived the landing to Venus so no spaceships have went to Venus since. According to paragraph 2 it says "" Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" A spaceship has not went down on Venus because ofthe fails with the space creaft's.

Venus is way hotter than the temperatures is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth . According to paragraph 3 it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun."" Even though Mercury is closer to the sun Venus is so hot because of all the erupting valcanoes, earth strikes, and lightning strikes that may land on Venus's surface. Astronomers believe that Venus was once similar to Earth because of its features. Paragraph 4 says ""today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valley's mountains, and craters."" The Astronomers think since Venus looks similar to Earth because of the rocky, mountains, and valley's type of features.

Some people may think studying Venus isn't a worthy persuit because of how dangerous it could be for astronomers to examine it. People also may think coming up with devices to make scientists float over the surface is putting them in a position of getting hurt due to all the fails that have happened.

In conclusion studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it will make people more curious about the planet and it will also allow scientists to learn more about the planet and get a better insight up close of the planet rather than far away.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explains that venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system and that humans want to explore it?! He mentions that that Venus is earths old twin. Keep in mind humans have never set foot on Venus or even taken a shuttle there, the only thing that has ever come close to Venus is a Shuttle with no one in it.

Old twins? The author states,""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Later in the article he mentions how people suspect that Venus used to just like Earth,""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"".

The author mentions how scientist are trying to come up with ways to explore Venus seeing how its to hot for humans to get close to the ground. One way scientist have come up with ways to explore Venus is having humans go in a shuttle and stay up in the sky where its about 600 degrees colder and use light to try and shine through Venus's atmosphere and getting a view of it from way up in the sky but still not being able to set foot on it to collect samples.

second scientists are also finding a way to make these probes and pods to withstand venus the planet. simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface. it has lasted three weeks in simulation.

lastly they are also looking into an old technology that has more withstand to that stuff and its called mechanical computors. they were created in the 1900 and was used in world war 2 they had no electronics it was just gears and wires and levers. but they do the job they can withstand a high pressure of heat and other forces.

The adventures to other planets are great but venus being the planet closest to the earth but each previous mission was unmanned and for a good reason since no spacecraft survived the landing for no more than a few hours. The differences in speed mean sometimes venus is right around the corner but sometimes venus is closer to mars and and it can be close to the earth as well.

These conditions venus have are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth;such the enviorment venus has.97% of carbon dioxide blankets a thick atmosphere of venus even more challenging the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature averages at 800 degrees Farenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90x greater than what the earth achieves.

The temperature and pressure in Venus's enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of the ocean would liquefy all metals and minerals. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Just as our jet airplanes travel at a high altitude to fly over many storms a vehucle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At 30+miles above the surface temparatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth.

This planet has the most Earth-like features in the Milky Way which makes it attract scientists. There are so many valuable reasons why the exploration of this planet is a good idea.

On the contrary, the most difficult part of the mission is Venus' atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide takes up 97 percent of the atmoshere; also the clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds.

If that does not damage a spacecraft, the pressure that is 90 times greater than Earth will. The temperatures there way over exceed the temperatures on Earth; the temperature there averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

The fact of Venus being the second planet from the sun makes it a lot more dangerous for a human to be there.

Scientifics explain that Venus has the hottes surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. People ask ""Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"", well Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, it means that Venus was the most similiar of the 8 planets in the solar system that looks more similar to the Earth, they belief that really long time ago Venus was covered with oceans and it could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters, which is another idea that makes the author think about know more about Venus.

Now The National Aeronautics and Space

Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The NASA has some projects in mind to do one of them is to send mechanical computers to Venus to take pictures and videos that way they can have a better idea of how Venus looks like. They are trying to use the same mechanical computers that they use during World War II, because mechanical parts can be made more resistant to preassure,heat, and other forces, it means that the NASA plans to send an electronic device to Venus just to see the place and star planning a visit, the would adap the device that way it could resist the different factor that are fount on Venus.

Venus has value , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.   ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
151F9011BF04,"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. The author supports this claim by stating that the insight to be gained is significant and by offering methods for obtaining these insights despite the danger that is readily appearant.

Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment. Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.

NASA is one organization that has been developing particularly interesting ideas about how to further study Venus. They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.

According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point. Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.

The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmostphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet.""

CCD30CE1E903,"In the article ""The Challenge of Eploring Venus"" it talks about the second planet from our sun (Venus) often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". Becuase Venus is sometimes very close to Earth, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on the planet. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it represents. Considering that no spaceship survived the landing for more than a few hours, it explains how dangerous it could be to explore it.

However, the author still seems to think that Venus is worth studying. Even though Venus is so inhospitable, the author claims that scientists still discuss further visits to its surface. Reason being is becuase Venus may have been once like Earth at one point. The Author states that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth. Even until this day Venus still has some features that are similar to Earth.

Venus has familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. It even sometimes can be our nearest option for a planetary visit which is crucial considering the long time frames of space travel the author states. The NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has a possible solution for sending humans to study Venus after three decades. It would allow scientists to float above the fray and avoid the unfreindly ground conditons. Instead of the temperature being 800, it would be lowered to 170 if they used a blimp-like vehicle that would hover 30 or more miles over Venus. This would make Venus's conditions a little more bearable.

Putting this idea to action wouldn't provide enough insight of Venus and its conditions. Scientists couldn't even take sampls of rock, gas, or anything else if they did it that way. Therefore, the author claims that scientists are working on a new idea to get up close and personal to Venus, despite the risks.

Furthermore, the Author supports in many different ways how pursuing venus is worth the dangers. He provides examples of how sicentists are working to make something that would allow astronomers to visit and explore Venus, how they are fascinated by the planet, and how Venus has value not only becuase of the insight to be gained but also becuase of human curiousity will most likely lead us into many intimidating endevors and that dangers and doubts should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

Venus is a worthy pursuit because you can discover so much and the story states that the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craterse. In the story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus it talks about what the planet Venus and it gives information about Venus,and also if the author would explore it. In the story Venus is the second planet from the sun while Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth,it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Earth,Venus,and Mars,our other planetary neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in spped mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Becasue Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent mumerous spacecraft to lan d on this cloud-draped world.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

First, Venus is set up with similar distancing as Earth it's sometimes often referred to as ""Earth's twin"".

Also the passage says in paragraph 6 ""Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else."" The passage says that because if NASA is going to have them floating above the premises they wont be able to conduct experiments because, they won't be able to take anything. Also because if just floating above the premises is 170 degrees Fahrenheit then when you get further down it'll be hotter so that means that if they try to grab a rock it could burn through gloves and possibly leave them with serious burns.

But NASA is working on other approaches because in pargraph 7 the passage says ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The author says in paragraph 8 "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

In paragraph 2 it shows that they have tried numerous times to send little spacecrafts to Venus but they have only been there for a few hours which is dangerous because if a spacecraft only stays there for a few hours imagine how long a human could stay there without over heating or coming back with serious health issues.

The author says in paragraph 2 ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.""But there are numerous factors to why Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study as they explain it in third paragraph.

In pargraph 3 the passage says ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus' atmosphere."" Which makes it a whole lot dangerous for humans to travel there to conduct experiments. But thats why they haven't sent anything there since three decades because they wanna make sure no one gets hurt. ",1,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
B131205A86C4,"In ""The Challege of Exploring Venus,"" the author says that further study of the planet Venus would be a worthy pursuit for humanity. Closer examination of Venus presents many dangers, but despite this, the author still believes that learning more about Venus would be worth while. The author supports his belief by explaining some of the curiosities that draw humans to Venus--such as the posibilty of having had life previously--, by comparing Venus to our home planet of Earth, and by exploring some of the ideas for how Venus could be explored.

In order to convince the reader that further exploration of Venus is worth the risk, the author peaks the reader's interest with ideas about the planet. The author knows that the idea of life existing outside of Earth is common thought for most people, so he tosses out the possiblity of Venus having previously supported life. He states that Venus was likely covered in oceans previously and, ""could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Life on other planets has fascinated people for generations, and the author decides to use this to try and convince the reader that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its presents.

The author continues to explain the reasons to further explore Venus, which he begins to aid with facts. The author describes how close Venus is to Earth, relatively speaking. He says that at times Venus is the closest planet to Earth. The author also decsribes the similarities that Venus has to Earth, including size, density, and surface. This author uses facts that support his claim to try and convince the reader of his idea, which works well in this case.

Like any good argument, the author highlights some counter arguments, and then gives possible solutions. For example, the author explains the harsh conditions of Venus such as high temperature and high atmospheric pressure. The author even tells the reader that, ""no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."" All of these seem like deal breakers, but the author does a good job of countering these points with solutions. The author describes ideas from NASA, such as a ""blimp-like vehicle"" that would float about thirty miles above the surface of Venus and avoid many of the harshest conition. He also disusses the use of electronics made of silicon carbide that would be better equipped to handle the intense conditions of Venus. The author looks at flaws in his idea, and finds solutions to them.

The author of this article believes that while studying Venus poses some challenges and dangers, but that it would be worth it. He explains why people are interested in Venus, and why it is a task that can be accomplished. He looks at counter points to his idea, and finds ways around them. This author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is worth the dangers it presents.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
EE9531CFE76D,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author explains why it would be a good idea to explore our neighboring planet of Venus. Despite all of the possible problems that can easily arise, the author claims it is a worthy pursuit. From evaluating the article personally, I believe the author supported his argument very well with even being able to counterargue many counterclaims by stating different innovations and different ideas that can make travelling to the ""Evening Star"" a reality.

The author claims it is important to study Venus due to it's striking similarities to Earth. The author states in paragraph 4 that scientists believe that Venus was once the most similar planet to Earth, once believed to probably be covered in oceans and probably even supported life. Even today, it is speculated that Venus has many land masses like ours such as mountains, valleys, and craters. The author also states in paragraph 4 that Venus can easily be our nearest option for a planetary visit considering how close it is.

Although, the horrible conditions of the planet have not allowed any human made spacecrafts to land on Venus for more than a few hours before being either torn apart or simply returning. However, after this claim from paragraph 5, the author uses support from NASA to state how humans could still visit the planet, however, will have to only hover over it about 30 miles into the atmosphere to avoid getting into serious danger. The author claims that although these still are not perfect conditions, they will be suitable for humans to survive in. The author then goes on to compell the arguement that they would not be able to collect any samples or even photo or videograpghy due to it being dangerous or ineffective. He therefore states in paragraph 6 that if scientists are seeking to conduct a thorough mission, that they need to get up close and personal with the planet.

The author also states in paragraph 6 as well how many scientists take Venus as a challenge and are actually coming up with different innovations in order to tackle Venus' tough environment with a surface that can reach up to 800°F and the immense 90 times greater pressure than Earth. These technologies include mechanical parts like found in the first computer had in order to be more resistant to heat and pressure being made from silicon carbide, which when tested in a chamber that simulated Venus conditions, survived a staggering 3 weeks.

Later, in paragraph 8, the author states that being presented a challenge to get to Venus has value. ""Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors,"" the author states in paragraph 8. The author claims that if we are able to tackle an astonashing feat such as Venus who is our neighboring planet, then we have unlocked the key to tackling many greater challenges.

In conclusion, I believe the author supports his claims very well due to him being able to understand the dangers of the challenge. However, the author then was able to find different supporting facts and innovations that can make a trip to Venus by man possible and seem more appealing nevertheless.

A615D47180DF,"The author uses many details from the article to support his claim that Venus is worthy pursuit desipte the dangers it presents by telling the reader how dangerous Venes is. For example the author tells us about some details about the temperatures, like how it would be around 170 fahenheit there. The air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. These details he gives us about the conditions Venus has are far to exterme, but the author says it survivable for humans.

A second, detail that the author gives use is about NASA trying to collect samples of rocks so they can study. But most of the robots they send to Venus get destroyed because of the choas that happens there. Another project that they did was that they used technology called mechanical computers. These mechanical conputers are are powerful, flexible, and quick but the are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions.

A third detial, that the author gave us information about the text was that not even a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. The author also goes on to say how the more challenging the place is the more they examine more closely. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. The Earth and Venus aslo orbits the sun in different times so its harder to vist it.

In Conclustion, Venus is very hard to get to because of it condtions there but it is survivable for humans. NASA has tried many times to get on Venus but they have failed many times. So i think the autor supports his claim really well with the detail he gives us. ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
A8BA15606564,"Venus is a place that all scientists these days are completely interested in. The reason why they are so into Venus is because first off, how Venus is called ""Our Sister Planet"" which means that Venus has some similar living conditions as Earth does. For example, Venus was origionally filled with mostly oceans that could've supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet according to the article used to or still has familiar features such as Valleys, mountains, and even living/moving creatures. Which makes Venus sound like it was origionally Earth, but you'd be worng there, because Venus has extreme weather conditions such as temperature getting up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, or the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more greater than what we experience on Earth. This is my story.

Venus is an interesting planet that scientists have been studying for generations on generations. With the information I gave from the article above would bafle any person in the world. A claim that I'm about to tell you will support the author of this article's idea that we should look more into Venus. For example, the information I gave above in the intro are some reasons why we should look into it more. Another reason why scientists should look at Venus more is, because even though it had all of those similar living conditions as Earth has, there's some drastic conditions that'll still make it non-livable. Some things that'll make a difference is Venus' weather conditions, Temperature is at an average of 800 degrees Fehrenheit. Another is because the air pressure would be at the same amount Earths Ocean's are at, which is not livable at all. And another example is that Venus has extreme thunder/ lightning and rainstorms which frequently hit the ground and would cause a lot of fires.

My final thoughts on this topic is we should study Venus because even though the thing I'm going to give as an example is not on the article. We should study Venus a lot more because, Venus used to or still does have some of the same living conditions, but when the planet has storms or has other negative issues, the planet Venus can get extremely violent naturally. And their weather conditions compared to ours on Earth are drastic, and make our hurricanes or other form of a storm that we think is terrible and powerful (which they are), will make us and Earth feel incredibly weak.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest studying venus is a worthy pursuit.

In the passage the author explains how we could adapt if people were to go there ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" The author also states ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" Not only mechanical parts and machines, alot of things could be made for people to be able to adapt to Venus.

D0ECE9485463,"In the article, the author implies the idea that studying Venus is a worthy endeavor despite its many dangers. By using examples, descriptive details, and more, the author supports this claim very well.

The authors does many things in this article to show the relevant danger that the planet Venus presents. They did this by using factual information at the beginning of the article. For example, in paragraph 3, the author states that ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". This example show the evident danger that Venus holds. Another example of the author showing the dangers of Venus is the author states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". This being another example of how the author shows the dangers of Venus.

Though, on the other hand, the author also gives the idea that Venus is worth exploring despite all of its dangers. One example being when the author says, ""astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Eath-like planet in our solar system"". This shows that the author believes that Venus is a worthy planet to be explored despite the danger it holds.

Another example of how the author supports theri claim is that they used factual information in the article. An example of this is in paragraph 5,where the author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". This is one of the many factual statements throughout the article that shows the support of the author's claim.

The author also says this statement at the end of the article saying, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovation"". This shows that the author also believes that Venus is worth exploring because they give their own opinion about the future expeditions of man and how they should forever expand exploration.

5FBFB86A1E8E,"Thre has been no spacecraft to ever land there more than a couple hours. That means it would be immpossible for any human or any living thing to even enter its thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. This explains why the author is explaining why the pursuit is dangerous, A long time ago the autor stes that Venus probaly had a ocean like earth and many other forms of life as well, and Just because it can be really dangerous to try to even visit Venus that does not mean we will not try.

The author suggests that studdying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers it presents and it could be immpossible. The author states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" (para.3). This explains the accertion because it would kill us as soon as we enterted in the atmosphere. So that would mean that it would be very dangerous to pursuit Venus.

A long time ago Venus was just like Earth. The autor states that ""Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (Para 4). This explains that Earth wasjust like Earth a long time ago because it was covered largely with oceans. Another reason it was just like Earth was it could have supported many other forms of life as well.

Just because it's really dangerous to pursuit Venus that doesn't mean we are going to stop trying to send people to Venus. The National Aeroand Space Administration (NASA) has stated that NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"" (para 5). NASA explained that it would be really dangerous to pursuit Venusbut they have ways around it. They said they would go 30 miles above the surface so they would not harm the people.

The author states that it would be dangerous or impossible. But that does not mean we won't have some brave people that are willing to try. NASA is working on a plan that could make this pursuit possible. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
3CEF69F60CAF,"Venus, along with Mars are the closest planets to Earth, they also at one point or another might have been similar to our planet. Yet, we have explored Mars much more than we have Venus. Venus has left us mind-boggled on how to study it with it's dangerous conditions, such as the thick acid rain, the average temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Though the exploation is worth these risks for we can explore a planet that scienctists believe could have been once similar our own. Nasa has developed many ideas and solutions to hopefully find new ways to study one of the closest planets to us.

The first way that NASA has created to help us observe Venus is a blimp-like plane to fly over Venus. This idea of the vehicle is stated in paragraph 5, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly gorund conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Also later on in this paragraph where it states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" Now these conditions would most defintely be harsh, but would be capable of living through, escpecially astronauts who are/would be trained for these conditions. This would at least give us an above look of Venus and be able to study some of it's physical features.

The problem that NASA would now have is figuring out a way to study up close and on the surface of Venus. They have a solution for this issue as well in the form of old World War 2 computers, the solution to this problem is explained in paragraph 7 as it says,""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers..."" Also further on in the paragraph it reads,"" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" And even later in paragraph seven it states, ""By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."" These older computers would be able to be dropped down onto the surface of Venus and take samples of the terrain and it's geological features allowing NASA and it's scientists to study the information gather and create better models to study more of Venus and understand the planet.

Another way NASA is thinking to study Venus on it's surface is simple electronics, the ideas and princples of these machines are stated in the beginning of paragraph where it states, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The simplified electronics would be used the same way as the mechancial computers, in which to study the terrain of Venus and collect data from Venus and to send it back to NASA allowing them to study the data.

Venus is a very interesting planet with many disadvantages and conflicts like the difficulty of being able to study the planet's terrain or even to be able to observe the planet in a hover-like state from above. If the challenges that NASA faces can be solved with solutions stated above, then Venus could be a very worhty pursuit, so that we may discover the secrets of one of the closest planets to us.

AD61576E5147,"The the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author argues that humans should continue our attempts to land in the planet. Despite describing the dangers of the daunting task, the author provides several thought provoking arguments to support his/her claim.

One argument is that Venus is the most viable option for a planetary visit from the human race. Venus is almost identical in density and size compared to Earth, and may have had extremely similar enviroments and biomes long ago. Today, we can still recognize land shapes such as mountains, valleys, and what might have been oceans long ago. This provides evidence that Venus may have supported many life forms in the past, and could very well do the same again. If Humans can find a way to survive on the planet, we could possible have a second Earth,

The author also lists several innovations that would assist humans in teh examinationa nd exploration of Venus. One is a blimp-like station that would float approximately 30 miles above Venus' surface. Doing this would allow scientists to avoid the treacherous ground conditions and storms. Being above the storms would also give scientists and almost infonite amount of solar energy, and though conditions would be extreemly hot, there would be no danger of radiation.

Modified technology could also be created to function of Venus' harsh terrain. Instead of using the fragile electronic tablets and computers of today, scientists could use a machine that was used in WW2, known as the mechanical computer. The mechanical computer used gears and levers to make calculations, and didn't require any electricity. This machine could be easily modified to widthstand dangerous conditions. Other simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a simulated venus atmosphere and lasted several weeks in the conditions.

With careful planning and a new approach, humans could have a chance of getting onto Venus. the author claims that after stepping up to this challenge, the human race would be prepared for more dangerous endeavors.

The fact that all previous attempts to land spacecraft on Venus, well, didn't work, designing a machine that is able to withstand the harsh conditions that Venus presents is pretty challenging, but

NASA claims it can be done. They say having a vehicle floating abouve the chaos that is Venus' atmosphere would be feasable. we'd also have to take a step back in the technology department. Mechanical computers, which were a huge help in WWll, don't require electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations.

9C88FA75BF98,"Have you ever travled to another planet? If not here are some points and tips on ""The challenge of exploring Venus."" First the planet Venus is much earth-like. It can cover large lands with oceans. Venus can support various forms of life such as moutains,craters,valleys etc... Still to this day Venus still has earth like features.

Next, NASA has come up with some helpful things to help people traveling up to Venus. NASA's possible soultion for the condtions is to try and make it to where they can allow scientists to float above the surface. They say that the solar power would be plentiful and would not exceed earth levels. NASA is also doing stuff with the machines like innovations that allows people to know the knowledge of Venus.

Then, The sudies for Venus are pretty neat. The text states that,""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the cahos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Scientist also say that they think the modern computres are powerful and quick to use for studies like this. It can be resistant to the heat etc.

Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. It has a lot of value to them. They want this research and all to go good because of the human curiosity. The travlers should not be limited by dangers and doubts on exploring venus. So, looking forward to exploring Venus?       ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
B8A1DB607D3B,"Could Earth end up turning out like Venus? NASA has sent many spacecrafts to Venus trying to figure out what it is like under the atmosphere. Although it may seem like a waste of time to send stuff there, studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers because it can teach us more about our solar system, it can possibly be a replacement planet, and if we find out that it was like Earth we could try and fix Earth before it happens again.

Studying the planet Venus would help us better understand the rest of our solar system. The taxt says ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus (Paragraph 3)."" It also states ""and the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet (Paragraph 3)."" We haven't seen anything like this, which is why we need to study it.

Venus could possibly be a replacement planet for Earth. We just need to find out how we could make it a liveable planet incase the Earth just keeps getting worse and worse. It states ""Often referred to as Eath's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size (Paragraph 2)."" The text also states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth (Paragraph 4)."" These mean that at one point we couldv'e lived on Venus since it was so much like Earth.

If we were to keep studying Venus and we find lots out about it then we could see if Earth would eventually turn out like that. As stated ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth (Paragraph 4)."" Another point is that ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth...such as valleys, mountains, and craters (Paragraph 4)."" This says that Earth and Venus look a lot alike and they could be ""twin"" planets which also means that the Earth could end up one day being just like Venus.

We need to study more about Venus to help out ourselves and the Earth, so we don't end up like Venus. They either need to send ships to research Venus to help Earth or having to find another planet for our future generations to live on. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
EB3398FD0FF5,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states that exploring Venus would be an immense challenge to overcome due to all of the extremely harsh conditions. Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star,"" is an extremely dangerous planet to explore. Even though scientists are aware of these difficult factors, people like the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" still think that being informed about this bright point of light is worth it.

According to astronomers, Venus may have at one point been the planet with the most Earth-like features. Venus is said to now have a ""surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These characteristics are one of the reasons as to why the author states that Venus is a pursuit worth risking many things for. Another reason is because in paragraph 4, the author states ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" Although these are all fair reasons to want to visit Venus once again, astronomers have to keep in mind all of the negative characteristics that will set their exploration behind. All astronomers and explorers are well aware of all of the challenging conditions such as the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater in Venus than the pressure in Earth. These are not the only challenging conditions; another dangerous feature is that temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit in Venus's surface.

Consequently, the author states in paragraph six that there are now many scienstist searching for technology that will be able to stand the harsh conditions in Venus: ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" In the previous paragraph, the author informs the readers about an idea that NASA has thought of. The plan for sending people to study Venus would not give the necessary information to be properly informed of this volatile planet. All of these obstacles are not enough to calm human's desire of knowledge about unearthly topics. In paragraph eight, the author says that all of the challenges are not enough to mellow down our curiosity enough to quit studying Venus.

In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
B382F142AD2D,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" I disagree with the authors claim strongly. One of the reasons I diagree with this claim is because in the passage it says""Each previous mission was unamnned ,and for a good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. This tells me as a reader that why should we take such a big risk on losing so much money on a mission if we can barely survive on the surface for a few hours. Also the clouds on venus are made out of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The surface tempature on venus averages 800 degrees Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric preasure on venus is 90 times greater then what humans experience on earth. This tells me as a reader that trying to explore venus would be a great challenge and would have a lot of consequences to it.

The idea of Nasa of having a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the roiling Venusian landscape is basically pointless. The humans that would live on these vehicles would have to live through harsh conditions but they can survive. Why would you put someones life in danger and have them suffer for a planet that we cannot live..Even if we did this mission we wouldnt be able to take photographs and videography since the atmosphere is so thick. In The passage also says""More importantly,researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas,or anything else from a distance"". This means that we wouldnt be able to take anything off the planet and all the mission would be good for is sightseeing.

In conclusion I disagree with the author and his claim saying that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. The reason i say this is because exploring venus has to many risks and it could cost lives of humans. In my point of view humans are priceless and they should not risk their lives on a planet that is not habitable. Also even if the mission was sucessful we would not gather many samples on venus due to the fact that the atmosphere is so thick and the conditions on venus is unhabitable. I personally believe that maybe in the future we should have a mission to venus ,but right now knowing all the risks that exploring venus has, that we should work on the technology more and make sure that in the future exploring venus and learning more about it will be possible in the future.

D376F0C62410,"Venus containes many mysteries to the human race, because of ourl lack of intel and capability to acces information. The rare and extreame conditions found in Venus are no were near those of Earth; meaning it doesn't have the capasity to sustain human life. The article ""The Change of Exploring Venus"" indicated these dangers, and the lack of equipt technology with the ability to servive in Venus' atmospher. Many scientist find studing Venus worthy, despite the dangers. The author does a pore good supporing this idea, becasue the main focus of the article was the negative side of studying Venus.

One of the article main points was the difficulty of human acces to Venus. ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Demenstarating, the danger and almost none existing survival late of a human being. "" The condidtions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth..."" indicating the incopasity of human to rome Venus. These two quotes from the articel indicates the articles focus on the non survivable atmosper and conditions on Venus, this controdiction the idea of Venus being worth sudying.

The next point he articel cfocused on was the technology available and its capasity on Venus. ""For example, some simplified elecronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Indicating, that techoology can not support Venus consitions for long, despite its advancemnts. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, fexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" Therefore, this demonstrates how Venus atmospher and condition is dangeres even to our most modern technology. Refuring to the incapability to substain the copasity to keep humans alive for long after reaching Venus atmospher.

Finally, the article never indicated why the study of Venus was important. The first four paragraphes focus on the the conditionds of Venus and what would be found in it. These paragraphes give no indication of how Venus affect the Eather or those living in it. most of what remains of the article focuses on the posible advancemnets and ideas or techological difficulities. These things also have no impact on the importance of studing Venus, rather creat another reason not to. These detail, though their purpose is to inflorme and inspire a desire to study Venus only creates a sence of uneasines and un-worthiness.

In conclution the articles main focus was on the opsticles being faced in order to safely study Venus. Leading to the lack of evidence or reasons why it is worth studying considering the dangers.    ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
A0D8BDC24F96,"I believe the author supports his claim that studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers it presents by stating ways it could benefit the human race. I see the author use many examples of how exploring Venus will help the human race now and in the future. I think the author really believes that exploring Venus is a worthy cause.

The author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is one of his many reasons why we should explore Venus, because in the future it could possibly be our new home. The author also states that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various types of life."" This is yet another example the author presents to show why Venus is so worthwhile. So one of the main reasons the author believes Venus is a worthy cause despite its dangers, is because in the future it could possibly be our new home.

The author also states that

""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author means if we can get past the challenges of Venus it will allow us to face other challenges in the future. The author tells us that we should ""not be limited by dangers and doubts,"" and that we should explore into the ""very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author wants Venus to just be a stepping stone in our long journey of challenges. The author wants it to be something we overcome and get past so we can explore and learn new things.

Even with the many dangers the auhtor stated we can all see exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit. Dangers such as: 800 degree weather, the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than Earths, and the sulfuric acid clouds are some of the many challenges preventing us from exploring Venus close up. To overcome these the author hints at a need for stronger materials and a way to survive the temperatures and pressures in such an environment . But the author has hope that we will figure all of this out. The author even states that a material called silicon carbide has been tested in conditions such as Venus's and have shown to last up to three weeks. He also states that we are thinking of using old mechanical computers to send to Venus because they can be made more durable. So the authors hope for exploring Venus close up may be made into a reality.

So in conclusion the authors support of his belief that studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers it presents are strong and have many benefits. The author believes it will benfit us now and in future endeavors. There are many promising technologies being developed for this specific reason. There may be hope for exploring Venus afterall.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

He goes on about things being made or planned to counter rack the dangers of Venus showing he has intrest in it. He also seems to know a bunch of unccomon facts about Venus. Lletting the reader know he went to the trouble of learning about what he's talking about.

In paragraph 8 it states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" That quote shows that he wants to study Venus even though there's danger, he thinks overcoming those challenges will better humanity. Still on paragraph 8 the text says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This statement shows that no doubt or possible dangers should stop or limit us from exploring. This shows that he thinks we need those challenges to meet the limit of our imagination and innovation.

The author shows evidence that Venus holds some information of the history of our solar system and of itself. Like in paragraph 4 the text states "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" That states that other forms of life could've exsited before us, also that Venus was once like us. Also this line ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" supports that Venus still has some things in common with us. ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" this statement shows that Venus is also our most convient planet because of space travel.

The author does support studying Venus, by listing his opinions in the last paragraph, which would be paragraph 8. He also talkes about it's importance in the future and present in other paragraphs especially paragraph 4. He also list somethings that can evolve into the soultion we need to study Venus in paragraphs 5-7.

EDA297550E87,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" wants others to believe that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. The author supoorted his supported his ideas in very well ways that I will explain to you now.

He believes that people should study it because they are making more ways for us to get knowledge about it, he also describes how interesting Venus is, and because you gain insight of the planet itself.

NASA is working on a solution for humans to study Venus in a new way. As stated in the article ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rooling Venusian landscape.""(Paragraph 5). He's saying they are trying to create a vehicle that will let them study mars from above instead of landing on the planet. This supports his idea because this solution that they're creating is, ""survivable for humans"" (paragraph 5).

He describes many features, interesting feautres about Venus. In the article it states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit,"" (paragraph 3). This a true fact that might spark the interests of humans to study Venus a bit more. Also he states that "" Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" (paragraph 4). Who wouldn't want to study a planet that could've possibly had life exsistence since it was so Earth-like.

Studying Venus is a huge challenge. It has proved that in many ways but that's another reason why the author encourages us to study it. He feels as stated in the article, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" (paragraph 8). Meaning that we should not limit our studies because of danger. His opinion is that we should keep studying, ""to meet the vey edges of our imagination"", (paragraph 8). We shouldn't have to imagine things that we have opportunities to see it real life.

In conclusion, he made very good points that support his ideas. Maybe one day these ideas will inspire someone to actually study Venus and face the challenges that comes with it. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
DE03BAA4291D,"Everyone knows that a teenagers emotion can change very fast .Some people know that If in a bad mood it can affect how us students do our work. I think its not a terrible idea to have facial recongition to access our emotions.

First, I think using technology to access our emotions is a smart idea. Teachers often pick on the students who dont seem to be paying attention to what he or she is saying but what if that kid that they call on is just having a bad day? well with this technology they can tell if their students are sad or mad or even surprised .

To continue, I also see why people would argue why it is not a good idea. Maybe the technology will glitch and cause error. People also might say that the technology is reading enough of our emotions, and should include more emotions to read. Maybe it doesnt read some important ones like disgust or surprised. I would like to argue that even though it may not be able to read all of our emotions yet that they might be able to come up with ways to read more of our emotions in the future.

Secondly, I think it would be a greater and easier way for teachers and classmates to come in touch with their students and be able to support them when they are in need. I also think if schools began to use them less students would be bullied because knowing everyone else can read the bullies emotions will not help the bully and he will begin to stop and realize what he is doing to himself and his peers. I think using this technology will help with bettering our world.

to continue, I think people would disagree with me becsuse our world has a lot of problems with technology and should try and reduce how much technology is being used nowadays. Everyone uses technology to communicate with each other and now letting technology tell us everyones emotions can cause a lot of damage to our new world. It would take away our sempathy and empathy we have for people as we communicate with them about how they feel and using technology to tell us how someone feels is taking away the point of even talking about it because everyone already knows.

Lastly , I think getting this technology will help better our schools and help better our technology. Many things could go wrong with technology but with schools helping and participating giving the creator feedback on how it is working and what needs to be better about it. I think if enough schools participate in getting this technology we will come into better understanding with technology and each other.

If a student is feeling down you would really notice by their participation in the classroom and their facial expression if the student is into anything but if not why is it so important to just look real quick on the software of how the students emotional expression is? This new software thing is really cool and interesting in some way because its great how someone is able to create technology software to see how someone really feels when they are taking a picture if their "" happy, sad,angry,exhausted"" that's very interesting to find out,but i only think its not really a big of a deal to even to study it on students. So I strongly disagree to this option. I also would like to add I think it would be interesting for students to use as an essay in class for like a history class to do a project like this for any assignment because its very interesting to see examples as Mona Lisa really felt the day they took these photographs that made the picture so famous:how did they really feel.

The human emotion is very hard to understand, but once you do your life can become a whole lot easier.

First I think that the technology is valuable because expressions are one of the keys of understand ourselves and each other. In the artical is states, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" I think expressions are a way to become a sentiant being to.

Teachers can take this information and use it to better their classrooms. They can make their lessons more interactive and fun. The software would allow for more labs to be performed in science classes. It might inspire students to go into science fields if they enjoy the F.A.C.S.

The technology could help teachers recognize struggling students. Many students will not say that they need help, even if they do. Teachers may be able to help brighten a student's day, so they do not spend the rest being sad. This could help prevent school ""accidents"" and keep the school's environment ""happier.""

8202209A4062,"This article is going to change the world toady as we know. If we allow our computers to identify human emotions, its a whole new way to look at life. People will be able to get what the want when they want because their computer will know when they are happy or mad at something. For instance, if you are online shopping and your face seems disgusted by a bright yellow shirt, the computer will see your expression and change the shirt to a blue one. By having that change be done for you, people will instantly become happier and have what they want right in front of them.

In my opinion, this new use of technolgy could be very helpful for many people. In the essay, it states the percent of emotions that the painting of Mona Lisa is. No one could ever be that spot on, so with the Facial Action Coding System, we now have the precise percents of what Mona Lisa's emotions are. By having these percents, we now have a blast to the past to think about what Leonardo da Vinci was thinking while painting this portrait. Maybe the reason she was mostly happy is because he was a genuinely happy person. It opens up a whole new door to what we can study and research. Since no one from back then is still alive today, this is our way of finding out not only what he was doing, but better yet what he was thinking! There is not a single machine that can do that today, so having this device would be a game changer.

Although the Facial Action Coding System would be an amazing new technology to have, many people could disagree with the system. Since having this system means that something, or even someone, is always watching you, people could feel that it is an invasion of personal space. They would alwasy feel like someone is there, even though no one is. It could lead to mental problems, such as thinking you are not alone and that people are watching your every move. Because of this, the system could be a bad call and lead to a bigger failure then they hoped. Today we are already facing problems with hackers hacking into our webcams and recording what we do without knowing it. This system is doing the exact same thing, but without the trouble of hacking.

Emotions should not be calculated because it is an invasion of personal feelings, inner thoughts, and emotional expressions.

People have personal feelings that they dont want shared with everyone. In the article the author introduces a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that allows computers to recognize human emotions. However, this is a complete invasion of personal feelings because everybody has the right to a closed mind. The author has also said that, ""...you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Sometimes that's not always the case because people have inner thoughts as well tht they hide.

Another reason why emotions should not be calculated is because people have inner thoughts that they dont want shared as well. Through paragraph 5 it shows how people can see what other people are thinking based on their facial experessions, but that is not always true because some people hide their inner thoughts for the sake of others opinions and feelings. Inner thoughts should stay inner thoughts until the person thinking them is ready to share how they feel. The passage explains how most communication is non verbal, inlcluding emotional commmunication. Furthermore, this proves that if people cannot see certain emotions someone portrays to them than that someone doesnt want those emotions to be shown because it isnt that hard to pick certain emotions out by the way one is looking at you.

Lastly, people's emotions should not be calculated becasue it exposes their emotional expression. This article shows that people have a lot of expression and it can be determined with this Facial Coding machinery. People sometimes express emotions only to help another persons inner feelings. Using what the author has told about this system, for somebody to take a computer and actually go in your head to see what your actually feelings could not only expose yor emotional expression, but hurt someone else's feelings as well.

In this article they share about the Facial Acting Coding System. They ask us if we agree with it or not. My answer would be yes, I think there is nothing wrong with it. My personal opinon is it is actually kind of cool. This can really help people out knowing others emotions.

The reason I think there isn't anything wrong with this is because I dont see its harming anything. When I said it could help people I was refering to when they said that it can show when someone is bored and that the teacher could try to make it less boring. If I was a teacher or I wondered hiow someone is I9 would want to use this.

Another reason this is helpful is that it can detect when someone is feeling down or mad or something else. When someone sees what it detected they can see if the student needs someone to talk to or help. When a teacher uses this and they see that the student is bored and not focus they could try to make it fun or do something at the moment and make the focus and awake.

This system can be compareded to peoples thoughts on what some are feeling. There are some people that can almost do the same as this. But this system can do it pretty fast and tell yus exactly everything. They say when you do this you move your muscles and whatever ones you usae can make you happy. Which I think is cool and smart.

In conclusion I totally agree with this. Almost everything I put is my feeling on this Facial Action Coding System. Overall I can say it can really help some people out and that it is very smart.

""The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery, most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication"". Sometimes muscle clues might be wrong because sometimes people might not be able to indicate a genuine smile and a forced one but facial action coding system would be able to detect when students are happy and when they are lying.

1D549C77CB16,"There are mny factors that influence using technology to read emotions in the classroom. The technoogy can influence certain lessons based on given understanding. Facial expression evaluated by these computers could help teachers. This kind of technology could benefit the future as well. Lesson planning, teacher help, and futue technology are three factors that contribute to using emotional expressions for the classroom.

Facial exression are a elling sign of the current state of emotion a person is in. These emotionas are universal for people to understand, such as a smile representing a good mood of a friend. Now computers are able to tell emtions based of facial muscles, which has led to innovations in the classroom environment. For example, if a student is working on a homework assignment and gives off a look of confusion, the computer can tell that the student is struggling to understand whatthe question or problem is asking or how to solve the problem. This new technology could benefit the student in that the lesson could be mdified to help the comprehension of the learner.

This technology could help teachers ina sense that they have easier communication with their students. Since teachers have to teach a multitude of students, it can be difficult for the teacher to see who is struggling with the material presented, Most communicaton between people is done through that of emtional communication rather than verbal. From that this formof technology can help teachers know who comprehends themaerial, who is confused by the directions or the material, or those who simply do not understand the content. Using this facial expression technology can be of beneficiary to those in educaion.

Emotion technology can be of benefit to not only the school evironmwnt but also can open new doors for the future. Even though the algorithm is not compatible with a normal PC at home, this technology could benefit in the future for new innovations such as helping a students interest levels for at home assignments. The only slight flaw that could go against this facial software is that computers cannot detect genuine emotion. Such as a person hiding certain emotions that are not shown on a facial expression. However more advancement and developments of this technology in the future could benefit many people in different circumstances.

Many factors of Facial Action Coding System can help benefit students in a classroom. Three factors significantly hold value to the influence of this software. Students can be able to have customized lessons to maximize learning in that subject based of assinments completed on the emotiion recognizing software. Teachers will be able to communicate better with students in helping undrestand the content and what needs to be focused on more. Future softwares can be made from this intial technology that can recognize students understanding and comprehension of the material from at home assignments on possiby a PC. Overall, the ability to recognize emotions of students from muscle movements of the face is a great advanncemet for the classroom enviroment, and once more developments are made, man students will benfit in being able to understand the material beter.

It sometimes can be use for just certain things and if that person gives you permission to look at the Site, then yeah it can be used to determine how they are feeling. Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology but some other people may also think that is just as same as other technology. For example, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This means that this technology mostly works only when your smile like it said on the text. Yeah it may be awesome to other people but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling.

What this can prove is that the process of expression recognization requires no harm to the face or person and is created by the studies of not only technological professionals, but also psychological preoffesionals as well.

B3A71739C324,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think using the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read students' emotional expressions in a classroom. I think this because if a student is bored or tired, you can tell just by their face on how they feel. Also, this new technology system could help humans learn how to use their muscles in order to make them smile again. In the next two paragraphs, I will explain using eveidence from this article on how this is true.

Using the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System shows how you feel just by the look on your face. In paragraph 5 it states ""In face, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look her on face... Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions... His new computer software update stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This statement from the text is saying how humans show emotions just by their face. This detail states how using the new technology shows us more on how a person is feeling.

The new technology called the Facial Action Coding System also shows humans on how to learn to move their facial muscles. In paragraph 9 it states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help you produce them... Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" This is stating that if you use your facial muscles, you can actually start to feel slightly happy. This detail explains how using your facial expressions can actually make you feel slightly happy.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" this new technology the Facial Action Coding System is valuable with students in a classroom. We can tell by students' faces on how they feel, but the new technology helps us figure out their emotions even more. The technology is a very good use if you want to figure out someone's emotions. This can also help students realize what they actually feel and start moving their facial muscles to make them feel slightly happy again. The more you move your facial muscles the slightly happier you will get!                  ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

70954F3B8FBC,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" talks about a software that has been developed to percieve the emotions of others. This software determined that the Mona Lisa is 83 penrcent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.

For sure is an interesting project, because sometimes we want to know how other people is feeling, but, this improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of the others as it is said on this article?

Dr. Huang explain how the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, but I think every human has different expressions, or they can hide them pretty well. For example: in a movie you can have a great actor. This actor can make perfect facial expression, as he was really feeling the situation; being truly sad, happy, scared etc. but he is an actor, and this feelings that he is showing for a specific situation on the movie, are not real. Those problems are not happening in his real life.

This actor can hide his emotions, and this software that can predict your emotions won't know that. So I think it's impossible know how people is feeling with just a software that works just by facial expression, because human feelings are more complex that this, and that's why whe have to study human behavior, or how their brains work with different feelings as love. Because humans are more complex than just an expression that you can hide.

In conclusion, sometimes, when people let you see their feelings, this program can work to show you the percents of your facial expression, but is not an accuracy way to do it because behind the human behavior there are more things to think about it if we are talking about feelings, and this may not be always the correct answer to the feelings of a person.

0EFC10AF9D22,"The use of technology to read the emotional exppressions of students in a classroom is valuablefor many reasons. Emotions are a strange thing, and not evryone is going undertsatnd you just based off of your looks. There is something called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that classifies our six basic emotions which are happiness, suprise, anger, disqust,fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and they rely on the muscles in the face to expose it all. All of this came from the relaization that no one knows exactly the expression on the painting ""The Mona Lisa""'s face.

Some have observed the face so much, they can just tell how you're feeling.

Like, in fact if someone close to me were feeling some type of way, I would be able to tell based off of their face expression unless it's ""just their face"".

Not everyone is the same because ""most human contact and/or communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication"" which is stated from the text. Technology has helped alot though in this, especially researchers, psychologists and most likely scientists.

In conclusion, The Mona Lisa painting face expression isn't unknown anylonger. A group of researchers, scientists and whoever else may it be got together to solve this mystery whether it be with a computer, or looking through books. And maybe through this I could pay more attention to face expressions since it's that easy. ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

Also many kids may think that its a bad idea but trying different things in the classroom could help many kids out. And the teachers would love that. But even if its not good the teacher wouldn't have to keep using it. In the artcle the author says, ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calcuate"" emotions - like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to espress how we feel?"" (D'Alto 2). Here the author makes a good point. Could this really would? How is it possible? Is it helpful? And there are many more quetions that I'm sure people have about it. But trying something new and seeing if technology like this could really be valuable is wroth trying out. Also this would be a good thing becasue kids would learn about art. The Mona Lisa is very famous and many people know about it. And learning more about it would be great thing for the kids in the classroom. I can see why many people wouldn't like it in thier classroom though. Maybe the teacher doesn't like art. Or maybe they don't know that much about art. But even if that's the reason for not trying this out I believe it would be good for the kids and they would learn something new and different. And that can be very imporant in the classroom and for the childen. At the end of the artile the author stats, ""By the way, did making a happy face in the experiment also mkae you feel slightly happy?"" (D'Alto 9).

9EAD1B4831C7,"Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face's, depending on how the person look with no smile, no anger, and no saddness. The emotional communication is nonverbal, showing the more emotion there is though our face's. Smile' are all differnet depending if it's a real one or a forced one. Faces don't lie, Smiling isn't being truthful they said. Willing to put on a face, it usually works most of the time, but not only to expresses emotion, it's tells us how they are feeling today or what they are going though.

When actors fake a smile or a frown they don't feel it really, they just make the face to prove or hide what they are feeling or showing. They act the show and give what's on the paper and have the same movement that we humans have to use when we express how we feel.

We have six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and there is sadness. They associated with each of our characteristics movements of the facial muscules. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" We have some software tracks on these facial movement that our brain follows, it can find out you're mix emotion and expression by you're neutral face. This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness. This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute, but not what they are feeling right after or before.

What I'm tryig to say is that our computers are blind and won't see what's really happening, our faces can lie to computers but not to people who know's what they been though and can see in other human their self. You got to see it deep into their eyes and smile if they are really happy or just really sad within their ife.

if a students is learning math on there computer and they are having trouble understanding what they are doing. The computer will see that they need help and it will most likely pull up a easyer way to solve the problems.

5C7BD98F4B35,"Using this techlonogy of Facial Action Coding System would be very useful and valuable to be used in a classroom.

There's are several of reasons why It's a good idea to use this genuis technique in class.

To start off It's pretty incrible that a computer can see what emotion you are feeling. Why not use it? It'll come in pretty handy. Let's just say that a student In the class is never doing their work. They're constantly distracted and they don't show any effort. The computer can tell us what emotion the student is feeling so then that way It'll not only be helpful for the teacher to know what's going on but it'll also be helpful to the student so that the teacher helps the student not to struggle so much.

It can also help with students that are confused and aren't sure how they are feeling or mayeb they feel a lot of things at once which is very confusing a computer than can show what your feeling is a good tool. It can help you firgure out what your feeling In cas you don't know how you feel.

Same with teachers. Students can firgure out what their teacher is feeling that way they can avoid getting into trouble. If they see a teachers angry they wouldn't wanna make them more mad.

As in for students. With this cool technology it can help students find out what's going on in case they have a friend who they're worried about and they're not so sure what's going on with their friend. Well this computer can quickly help you figure out what's going on with them. Im sure your friend would really appriciate that you help them out even if it seems like they don't.

These are the reasons I think that using this computer that show what emotions you've got is simply very helpful to both students and teachers. It's a smart way in not only showing how you feel but also producing them. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
9FCF0C8C83C3,"After reading the passage I came to the conclusion that some ways I think it's not valueble . FACS would be a smart tool for case workers or counslers . Some case workers deal with people who have emotion diseases such as post dramaic stress diseases in that nature . I feel like the creator could've made the tool for more serious reason, not that the emotion FACS was pointless but who would want to just find out their emotion and they can already feel it or going through it.

I feel like people would want to find out things more important like , whats going with that person , is the person feeling sick , is the person healthy . FACS could been about how's the day going to go , whats the weather going to be like . I feel like FACS is all hype in some way because it's basic , like yay we can see how we feel right?

They took all this time and objects figure how someones doing or feelings , instead of how we're living . Anyone can figure out someone's emotion expresses by their body language , their tone , how their speaking , when their speaking and etc. Often people may not want to speak on how they feel , alot of times teens want to keep their problems and emotions to them selves. Students are diffrent from adults, and also handle emotions diffrently.

FACS would be valueble if they come with conclusions to that person emotion at the time , plenty of ways technology can do things. If the FACS were a solution to a person with a bad day it would be valueble. Due to the fact their making this like it's a cool invention when FACS is exposing peoples feelings and then wat after that? I feel like the FACS should be upgraded and do more with it .

The use of this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a great way to see if someone is happy. It can possibly help others to see the person in front of them and what their emotions are or what that person is 'trying to hide'

It's all about muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (the muscles that begin at the cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth.

The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around the eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being thruthful.

Making a fake smile can also help produce a real one. Practicing with putting a pencil across your mouth works the same muscles as when a person is smiling for real.

8459600E47B0,"Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to bad until there comes a day where you want no one knowing how you're feeling. In the article, the author explains what this technology can do. So far, the article does a job identifying your emotional expressions, ""according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I am against the value of using this technology to read students thoughts or feelings. There are days when you want your own thougths and feelings kept to yourself, privacy, and as well as being able to learn something new everyday.

There come days when you don't want peope knowing how you're feeling and for some odd technology to just assume your feelings is just not adding up to me. The article shows a picture of the young Mona Lisa sort of smiling. Yes, she doesnt seem to happy, but is she? Only she knows. I dont agree with the computer system judging her feelings. ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfull, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto 1). To me, she looks like she's being forced to smile but like I said, only she knew her feelings while the picture was being taken. I don't believe that should be a thing, no one should be told how they are feeling. If we as humans dont really have a reason to judge, why should technology be able to.

Along with that, the article talks about ""a classroom computer could recogize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (D'Alto 1). Recognizing it could allow teachers to change their lessons, due to students being bored. How come? Daily there are students who complain about how boring a class is. No one forces them to come. Students come to school to learn, we don't expect to have fun. If a technology were to let teachers know when students were bored they'd be changing subjects seconds, by seconds. Students in that case, would be happy to act bored just for the sake of it. Less learning would accure if it were for the technology to detect kids who don't care about school who are constantly ""bored"". No one said school is fun, but neither should a technology detecting students feelings should get in the way of learning.

In the meantime, we have trouble understanding people. To allow a technology to have the power to easily understand thoughts, feelings of us humans is just critical. Allowing a technology to determine your friend's feelings is overrated according to my calculations. ""Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisly enough to convey specific emotions"" (D'Alto 1). I don't believe something so ordinary could barge in and make us feel disturbed knowing not someone but something knows the way we're feeling.

Therfore, I am against this value of using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions. I believe there are different types of people in this world. There are days where you don't want to share your feelings to people, so why technology. If we are willing to share our thoughts, we will. Not have something so unusal do that job for us.                                                ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

Also the teacher can understand what's going on with his or her students in the classroom to see if they are struggling or if they get on how to do the work. I think math teachers would really would like to have this because, they would be able to tell if the students are lying to them on if they get it or if they don't get it. So the teacher would be able to help the students more that are struggling with the work.

23C916766386,"I think that this type of technology could be very helpful but it could also be very scary if it isn't used properly. But, if it is only used for classroom use I think it could be very effective. There are plenty of ways this new technology could help schools help students learn better. Especially, if it could help kids learn the best way they can.

Face recognition is also used in the new IPhone X and there are already a whole bunch of new conspiracy theories about it. I think that is because humans have never seen this kind of technology used before, which can lead us to overthink and come up with crazy ideas in our heads because we don't fully understand this new technology. I feel as though Facial Action Coding System would get the same reaction at first which could probably affect schooling in general. Parents might hear negative stuff about this new technology and send their kids to different schools or start home schooling them, which would not be very good for the school's image. Of course, the talk would die down at some point but people might still be reluctant at first.

On the other hand, I think once all the suspicions do die down it would be a tremendous help to the school. As the passage was saying, that it could recognize if the student is getting bored it could change the way the lesson is being taught. I think this would help because everyone learns in a different way. It also was talking about if the student was confused and I was thinking maybe they could even just re-word how the lesson is explaining the material.

But, I do think the ad thing could be kind of annoying. Yes, it might help somewhat, but I, as do many other people, don't really like ads to begin with. Especially if they just pop up out of nowhere and onto my screen. It could help promote more things but I don't think that most people that are on the recieving end of these ads would be very fond of the idea.

In conclusion, I think that this technology could be very helpful ,maybe even cool, if used correctly and with a lot of testing and patience. You're gonna need patience because of all the theories I talked about because no one knows how long that could last. But, nevertheless, I think that it would be entirely worth it.

In the conclusion, now you know why the Facial Action Coding is valuable. It can tell different action of emotion of a student in class. You can tell if students are hiding there emotions. It was developed to improve accuracy in perceving the emotions of others such as students.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
DBF4A7FBD000,"Using the Facial Actrion Decoding System in the classroom would be valuable. There are many benifits to using this program in classrooms. Many students do not enjoy the time they send in school, so this could be a revolutionary approach to changing the way the American school system works.

One of the reasons the decoding system would help students is that it could help inhance student's grades. Because thecomputeris actively trying to bring the student's mood up, it could hep them to fully enjoy the information they are given. If the computer is constantly trying to inhace emotions, liking the material will cause the student to enjoy learning more. If a student truely enjoys what they are learning, they will work harder to do well in a class.

Another reason the decoding system would be benifitial to classrooms isbecause it could help students understand the concepts better. Not liking classroom material results in students not fully understanding the material and not wanting to pay attention. They soon become easily sidetrack and loose sight of remembering the information later on. Knowing that they enjoy the concepts will help with the understanding of the material. As stated in the text, "" A classroom computer could recongnise when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and also states, "" Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Some might argue that a human instructor may be able to do just as well relaying information as the computer, but most of the time a teacher must give the material to the class as a whole, and can'tfocus soley on individual emotions of the student, and if every student is enjoying the lesson.

The last reason why the coding system would be benifitial is because it could help with teenage mood swings and depression. teens seem to be less happy when they are confused and overwhelmed by schoolwork, and helping to adjust the material based of their moods could help increase their level of happiness. Helping to improve their happiness during school hours might in turn help them to be more happy overall.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom for many reasons. It can help to inhance grades, help students understand concepts better, and help with the teenage moodwings. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

Theres many ways that if the teacher is aware she/he can might can help out that student. Theres a saying that states ""you cannot read a persons mind"" which is true but you can sense there emotions by the look on their face sometimes . The Facial Action Coding can help you read fully what this person is feeling.

For examples The Facail Coding System can tell if you're faking your smile to keep from showing how you really feel teachers wouldnt know how you feel unless you tell them whats going on with you. Using the coding system can tell the teacher your emtions that way they can deal with it and move forward in your learning. Not only just a happy and sad emotion the system can consist but when the teacher is teaching the lesson she can tell if the students get in by the expression on their face the sensor can tell weather or not the student is fustrated or confused on what the he/she is teaching. The teacher can get a percentage of the students emotions about the lesson if teacher gets the results and they show simlar patterns of confusion among the she can revist the lesson . In paragraph 6 it states when the compture predicts how the student is feeling it can ""modify the lesson "" I believe that it'll help the student learn the lesson like everybody else is in their own way because everybody has different levels of learning

In conclusion I believe that ther Facail dectection can be very helpful in the classroom setting. It can help teachers learn and create lesson for everybody to get a better understanding in what they are teaching. The analaysis can also help everybody to come more aware and understand facial expression.   ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

Using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Since it can let you know when someone is lieing, or needs help from the teacher when its afraid to ask, also when someone has worries about something.

""The Facial Action Coding System enables comuters to identify human emotions."" This system can be very useful for school class rooms since it can detect when someone is lieing. Because the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; with all 44 major mucles in the model move like human mucles.

That ""classify the six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, fear, and sadness, which then assosiats with each characteristic movement of the facial muscles.""

Or it can let you know when it needs help and he/she is a afraid to ask. Its like when you look at someone and see that they are sad or happy. It can detect an espression like that. ""Now imagine a computer that knows when your having trouble.""

By helping the kid or person it could keep tjat person from makig bad decisons. It could help out long term for those students. It could also help a teacher find out how to teach a specific subject the way thsts most beneficial to students. The computer reading emotions could help with that by letting the teacher know a kid is confused about something. A lot of time kids or people in generall don't like to ask for help about some things because it can be imbarrasing or they are just independent people but if they need help and dont ask the system could pick that up and inform the teacher.

D4517AB595DB,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he defines how the new Facial Action Coding System allows technology to this day determine emotions of humans. The author uses the famous painting of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci as an example of emotion(s) the computer can detect. However, the new technology is a valuable advantage because it can express all emotions one could feel that could create a positive impact for greater educational opportunites in the future.

The 3-D model of the Facial Action Coding System is described to have a human-like appearance with joints like the human muscle. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individulas often show varying degrees of expression""(Huang). The future of technology is rapidly changing and adapting to become smarter and more like a human mind set. Like humans, the computer can detect if someone may be feeling one way through facial expressions. For example, ""We humans perform this same impressive 'caculation' everyday. For instance, you could probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Logically, if a close friend claim to say they might feel one way but you might feel they aren't expressing themselves like that. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions...Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of 'Da Vinci Code'!"" From the evidence of Da Vinci's studies of human anatomy, the ""code"" could be used on the FACS to determine a facial expression. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

The use of FACS can be a valuable source in the future to involve computers in communication. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that too."" From a scientific and professional point of view, Dr. Huang indicates that computers should be involved with emotions. It is valuable to say that technology to read emotional expressions of students in classrooms is indeed an advantage that can greatly impact their learning envoirnments. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" From this quote, it is foreshadowing that future education is likely to be involved of more computer activity. The medical and political field could receive a positive impact from this as well. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery.""

Overall, the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is indeed a valuable statement and can be used in further educational, political, and medical positive opportunites.   ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
42814ED28C18,"I think I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I do not think it is a good idea to use this on humans without their consent. Technology is important but I still do not think this is a good idea.

Using this on humans isn't a good thing. If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it. How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy. What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.

Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor but how far would it modify it. Also if this became a thing would it take the place of teachers. If so than that would be a bad thing. So many people would lose their jobs. It says that it would be able to tell if I am confused which is a good thing. That way I wouldn't have to ask the teacher to come help me. They would just know and come help me, but I still think it is a bad idea.

I'm just not sure that it is a good idea to have something that reads emotion. I feel like some things that are better off covered up will be uncovered. Technology will consume our world if we are not careful.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

They are predicting that this technology will be able to tell wheter or not a kid is confused or bored class. This could be good because the teacher might be willing to make up new and improved lessons intsead of the same boring old thing.

The reason I am against the Facial Action Coding System is becuase not everyone should be able to know what I am feeling. My facial expressions might show that I am upset over something so drastic but, its really i didn't get any pasta for dinner last night. Your expressions can read into to much. Then what, what are you suppose to when you find out everyone in your class either bored or upset you cant talk to everyone about their emotions not most people would want to open up, Which is understandable because you didnt come to school to have your teacher read your facial expression and start to anaylze everything about you.

Although I am glad we are able to make so much new technology and such high technology like FACS. It is not right to use the technology on students everytime they come into a classroom.

BAC14C5693CD,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author is describing a new technology, one that enables computers to identify human emotions. This could be valuable in the classroom for both a student and a teacher. Many teachers can find a hard time to deal with students because of things that could be going on at home. Teachers can find it hard to also help students if they don't know how they are feeling. Facial Action Coding system can help those teachers understand what a student is feeling.

For example, Sarah has a lot of family issues going on at home. She comes to school, doesn't feel like doing her work and her teacher want's to help her but doesn't know how to approach her. This technology can help the teacher get a better understanding on what Sarah is feeling and even ask her why she feels that certain emotion. This can build up a good relationship between a student and a teacher. A lot of students don't have good relationships with teachers because some teachers could say the wrong thing which leads to the student not wanting to say anything.

In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states that ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this also could a help a teacher to know what type of assignments or projects that she/he could give to the class so the students wouldnt be bored or confused. This could also give insight to the teacher on what she/he feels like they should do better in there lectures or what their teaching to the class.

In my personal expierence, I knew a lot of teachers who didn't know how to approach me because they either didn't know what to say or how to say the right thing. If my teachers had this type of technology built into the school computers and could see through their computer how student's and myself were feeling. I would have a much better relationship with most of my teachers because they would have known what I'm feeling, whether i'm feeling sad or angry.

In my conclusion, the Facial Acting Coding System would be valuable of students in a classroom because it could both help students and a teacher to be able to build a strong, trusting relationship and also giving insight to one another. This could help thousands of teachers worldwide on how they could help there students and also have a understanding on what they could change or learn in their classroom from a students facial expression.

DD69640C3EA7,"According to the article there has been a new technology invented called the Facial Action Coding System. The new technology was made to be able to reconzie a facial expression od how someone is feeling. My prompt is to explain weather this new piece of technology would be useful in a classroom, and i think that it coyuld be useful in a classroom. I believe that i would keep many fights from happening because would be abe to stop it befor it happens even though the technology dosnt tell what your thinking it could extress your emothions and someone could just atlk to you about what going on before it was the go any farther. Also i think it would be a good idea to use ina classromm setting because wha if a studen thereats to be a school shooter and as a techer you jus let those words go over your head and a studen be serious that tehnology will determant the student emotions and i think you wouuld be able to base the feelings on their actions they said the would take. This would save student teachers etc from bring weapons into a school setting to protect themselves.

Also this would be a goood idea because in school some studen are just to shy to raise their hand in class to ask a question they would ofect express being confused through facial expressions and the teacher would be able to tell their confused, it would seperate the confused ones from the ones who understand. It also could work out well for the students you could be able to see how your teacher is feeling. Half the times some student just go to class not ac ting like a student but alos not knowing how their teacher is feeling, and I think if more people knew they would be more conciderent.

1A9C565E8DC7,"The technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable because there it can show when someone is getting bored in a class. There are plenty of reasons for why to use this technology. One reason could be that it will detect when a student is bored or is becoming confused. Another reason that it should be used is that it would help inprove the lesson or what is being taught. Also most human communication is non verbal, so then the computers need to understand that.

One example on why the technology should used is how it will be able to detect when someone feels a certain way in a class or a lesson. The text states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""(D'Alto). This would help students and teachers because from the students prespective the teacher would know how he/she felt. A way that this would help teachers would be that it would give the teachers some feedback so that maybe if their student is bored to make their lesson a little energetic. Then the students and the teachers may have more understanding of eachother.

Another reason that would make this technology valuable would be that it would help improve a lesson for the students when needed. The text states, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto). This is refering to the last point. So if a student is bored, the computer would recognize the problem and change the lesson for the student so they could be more enthusiastic about the lesson. For example if a student is borred about learning about geography, and the student is bored then the computer could change up their lesson by watching a movie that follows what the person is learning about.

Also another reason for using the technology in a classroom about how a lot of human communication is not even talking to someone it is more body language than anything. The text says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication""(D'Alto). This means that not everything is about just talking to someone but there is also a lot that goes on with their body, facial expressios, the list goes on. For example a person can a have a converstion with someone and not even mean what they are saying, and the computers would be able to tell using their facial expressions and body language.

Whether a person think that this new technology is completely useless or not, this could help for students to learn more, and have interest in learning. This could help students by actually learning and doing better in school, because they would be able to fully understand each concept. For example if a student is confused with something and the teacher doesn't notice it the computer will, and it will change the lesson so that the student can get a grasp of the subject. maybe this new technology shouldn't be introduced into a classroom, but it would be of much help.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

How is the data going to be of use in science? The students can express their feelings, but what are the researchers going to do with this information. This technology should be used, but not in the classroom.

If we do end up using the system to detect emotions where will the data go. It will help the video game industry with the evidence from paragraph 6 ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" Why only put this into a classroom put it into the robots we are building today so they seem more human-like, so they can become more advanced than a ordinary robot.

946C874A9CCD,"The science of emotion recognition is complex and is becoming exponentially more complex the further a topic is being disscused. In the realm of arguing weather the use of emotional recognition technology should be used in a classroom can be a very difficult tquestion. On one side, you can say it may invade privacy, but on the other hand, it could help teachers see if students are understanding the topic. The question still lies on which one is more important for both the student and the teacher. In my opinion, this technology should be implemented into classrooms internationally because it will help students learn more effectivley, but also it will enhance the teachers teaching ability when they know where they're students are going array.

This technology could be very benificial for students across the globe. The ability for a piece of technology to understand your emotions could come in handy. There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally. This technology will be very valuable for the students for both their enjoyment throughout school becuase of the reduced stress, and their improvents in acedemic grades.

This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. Thius could be very valuable to create a strong teacher studnent realtionship where the teacher is able to understant the smallest change in emotion to when they're confused or if they understamd it. This relationship could improving the learning environment and how comfortable a student with their students and peers. This technology could help teachers in both big and small schools. In big lecture halls, it may seem to be difficult for a professor to understand the emotions of all the students sitting before them, they might not even be able to see everyone because some may sit further away. With this new technology, teachers could be notified when some students become confused and then revisit a topic. Small classrooms could benifit greatly to this as well. Althought they are in a closer proximity then in lecture halls, they still will have the issue of not understanding the emotions which could lead to confusion. In smaller classrooms the teacher could know what they're doing wrong and be able to fix this easily without having to disturb the students. They can evaluate the emotions throughout the lesson and then later, they can change their lesson plans to adapt to the confusion of the students. This is again, a very valuable piece of technology that could help the teachers grow in their profession.

Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant. This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever.

It would allow for the students to be put back on track if they are distracted or bored. It would also aide the teachers by giving them feedback that they might've never recieved before. Lastly, as a domino effect, it would help the entire world because we would be making the education system for our future a lot better.

Firstly, if we had facial recognition technology in the classrooms, it would allow for our students to recieve a better education. For example, a student is in class one day and a teacher is giving a lecture that they are just not interested in or don't quite understand so that student's mind begins to wander because they are bored. With the facial recognition, that student would be detected as distracted, bored, or even confused so the teacher can make adjustments to the learning space and/or the way that the material is being taught. This technology would help the students who would normally be confused and too shy to say anything, recieve help and better understand what they are having issues with.

Secondly, this facial recognition technology would be very helpful to teachers who would work with it. They would be getting direct feedback from the class without them even having to say anything. If the class is confused, the teacher can work around the confusion and readjust. This would ensure that students achieve the most information possible and would, therefore, make our teachers and the education system a lot better.

Lastly, I believe that the entire world could benefit from this technological advancement. Our world is changing and adavancing technologically very quickly and we have to be able to keep up. As the world gets smarter, we must get smarter with it. Better technology in the classroom means better learning which means even better, smarter pupils. Any technological advancement that makes our future doctors, surgeons, lawyers, etc. smarter then, I believe, must be put into use right away. We would be securing our future as a nation.

64FD220F0DF7,"Emotions are a vital part of human life. Although they are sometimes overlooked or seem to not be present simply by looking at someone's face, they are used every day. The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" introduces information regarding a technology which is able to detect the most common emotions. While this invention is widely seen as incredible, if not revolutionary, the Facial Action Coding System's presence is not valuable in classrooms.

The Facial Action Coding System does not have much value when it comes to using this technology to read students' emotinal expressions. The technology itself, while advanced in certain ways, is not that much more effective than a teacher's or students's abiltiy to distinguish feelings. The author, in his article presenting the many positives of this technology, addresses the idea that the system is able, from a 3D model it has built, to analyze the msucles of the face, matching their activity to certain basic emotions. The technology's ability to recognize emotions based on facial features and human behavior is something that humans have been doing automatically for centuries. The specific muscle structure is not necessary to determining one's feelings, as their use show noticeable changes on the face and are visible to the naked eye. Although this might be quicker, the technology would not have much value for classroom situations, as teachers could easily, while paying more attention to their students, notice the same details, identify changes in emotion, and alter their ways of teaching accordingly. Overall, the human's ability to identify basic emotional expressions would render this technology rather unvaluable in classrooms.

Similarly, the purely scientific origin of the Facial Action Coding System decreases the value this technological innovation would have for students in a classroom. While it might be successful in identifying the emotions of students, the Facial Action Coding System relies purely on the muscle behavior and structure, as mentioned in the article, meaning that no other factors would be taken into consideration. Many factors other than emotion, such as fatigue, can alter a student's appearance or behavior. The coding system would most likely, as a result of these underlying factors, as well as the very limited amount of emotions it can perceive, make the technolgy unvaluable when comes times to read student's emotional expressions. The generalization of emotions detected would produce false or unaccurate results, rendering the program useless in classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System, due to its computerized nature and lack of human perception, would not be a valuable addition to classrooms.

The lack of privacy this new technology brings makes the invention unvaluable. While some may think this to be a good way to improve student's lives throughout the school day, this facial recognition would raise many questions and controversy regarding student privacy. As the author states in the article, the Facial Action Coding System could be implemented in computers with the purpose of regulating ads and personalizing them to someone's preferences, likes, and dislikes. This is not only unnecessary, but would mean having a constant stream of visual information regarding students being sorted and analyzed. If this were implemented in classrooms, a number of parents and students alike would find this to be an intrusion of privacy, resulting in complaints, debates and overall unnecessary problems added to the education system. While this innovation might be somewhat useful or bring more attention to student's feelings, the excessive problems and controversy it would create makes the student emotional expression detector technology unvaluable and not a good addition to school.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The technology, although it could properly analyze the muscles and facial structure of students in classrooms, could easily be matched by a teacher, does not take in all possible factors, and would conjure up many questions regarding privacy in schools. While this program would have little to no value in classes, it could provide help to investigative work. Emotions are extremely versatile and human expressions, although they share some similarities, widely vary based off of each person and circumstance.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
AB31DD5907FA,"This new technology to allow us to read students emotional expressions is brilliant. Reasons being is it allows students to show their true emotion regardless if they act happy, or sad. This will more likely have less kids hide their emotion and can truly be worked on. It can be the difference between life or death. To prove that this technology can be used in advance, most of us know the famous picture of the Mona Lisa. Using this advance system most people will say she is just happy and smiling, 'but she's actually 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry'. Obviously we have more then one feeling but this is an prime example of showing this can work on other people and pictures from years ago and still show their full emotions, most people can claim to be happy a lot and be completley devasted. This will be the future to help towards others and will soon help for the greater good.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
D941FABC82E0,"New technologies are always interesting and beneficial towards any aspect of life. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) measures your facial muscles to calculate your emotions. Because there are characteristic movements of muscles when expressing different emotions, the FACS can recogonize the muscle movement and record the emotion. This newly discovered technology has great potential to be useful in several areas, such as understanding facial expressions, animating facial emotions, and commercial use. However, the use of FACS technology is not valuable in the classroom.

First, the FACS's ability to read emotions is not useful in the classroom. It can tell when students are bored, or when students are unhappy with the teaching method, but it cannot change the students' emotions immediately. The best it can do is notify the instructor to change their lesson, as stated in the passage. This itself is not a huge benefit, and is not valuable enough to justify the use of the FACS technology in every classroom.

Secondly, the FACS is very recent, advanced, and expensive. As stated in the passage, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (D'Alto, 7). If a home PC cannot run the FACS program because of its complexity, how would an impoverished school be able to provide this technology to every classroom? The cost of this technology to be placed in every classroom is a waste of money and time. Instead of being used in classrooms, this technology could play an important role in the study of art, such as Mona Lisa, or the creation of expressive virtual faces to be put in use for video surgery or virtual reality. The very limited benefits the FACS brings in the classroom does not outweigh the cost and effort of providing it.

In short, the FACS is a newly designed program that has potential to be applied in many different fields of study, but is not practical for the classroom. The ability to read students' emotions is both unimportant and eerily disturbing. The FACS has many benefits, such as recognizing emotions in art and creating virtual expressive faces, but none of these can be applied to the classroom.

FE9AB60822CA,"Having a computer that can tell what you are feeling can and can't be a good thing. Like you could be sad or depressed and not want anyone to know but they computer does. It can send information to people and you didn't want those people knowing how you are feeling. This can cause problems in a family because it may tell them something they didn't want to know.

First off some people would rather keep to themselves because sometimes showing their real self can hurt others. You can always fake being happy or fake being interested in something that you aren't, but the computer can figure out how you are really feeling and let people know that you aren't interested in the thing they are talking about or happy that someone is talking to you. It can ruin everything between people. The article states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to.

This is my opinion on being able to have a computer analyze how you are feeling. I think it would be a bad idea and it would be better off to let people keep their feelings to themselves. Computers being able to tell your feelings is a bad idea and shouldn't come to life. We should keep it the same as it is now, where people can be themselves and not worry about people getting scared or hurt by their true selves. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
CA73ECEE3BD0,"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System and gives, among other things, reasons why it could be useful in a classroom as a tool. The author states that the computer could be used to, "". . .modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" when a student gets bored or confused. I believe that it could be useful in student studies. However as we do not yet have fully automated school lessons, the Facial Action Coding System would be unused in most cases.

The information from this new coming technology is used to impersonate a human counterpart, therefore the information would be already in use by the human teacher already in a classroom. The computer does what teachers all over already do everyday and every class period. The expressions from students is already being used by the teacher to change lessons when they become noneffective. With teachers already doing that the information becomes useless for the teacher already has the skills to do so themselves.

The artical states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" If Huang, creator of the computer program, could creat a more home friendly version of the softwear it could improve the uses of such technology. For students who use an online school, this information could be much more useful. Online schools do not have the face to face connection that brick and mortar schools do, therefore the computer lessons could use the facial expressions to drasticly improve their lesson plans. They could scan the face of the student and see to what type of lessons the student responds better to and use that type of teaching more often.

In conclusion, in my opinion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is of limited value. With the use of human teachers the information given from the Facial Action Coding System is redundent. The softwear has many uses in marketing and online schooling, but the technology is of little value when the teacher is capable of reading the same emotions and putting them to the same use. The Facial Action Coding System has many places it would be valuable in, the classroom is not one of them.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
D2E41252A109,"The Facial Acting Coding System could allow you to express yourself without meaning to. It would be such a helpful thing for students, it could allow them to become smarter or even allow them to get a bad feelng out by letting someone know they are upset or stressed.

The Facial Acting Coding System would allow a student who was confused or bored to get extra help. As is stated in paragraph 6 of they are confused or bored it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor to help them understand. This would allow someone who was quiet and shy that is to afraid to ask for the extra help in class to get the help. They would be able to do so without speaking up in front of everyone and geting embarassed, they could just simply sit there and pay attention allowing the Facial acting coding system to see it.

The Facial Action Coding System would also allow someone who is very upset to get help without having to be straightforward and walk up to someone and ask. It could recognize you are upset as stated in paragraph 3 and it could alert someone that you nee help. You could then have them come to you instead of you having to start the conversation with them and theyd already know you were upset and needed to talk to someone.

It would also be able to find what you are interested in and help you find stuff you like and possibly what you want to do. As stated in paragraph 6 the computer can play an ad and it can see if you like it by the response you have suchas smiling it will play more ads that are like that one or if you frown it can avoid ones like that and play something the complete opposite until it finds what you like. This would also allow you to find people who are similar to you that like the same stuff allowing you to become friends and get closer tothe friends you already had.

The Facial Action Coding System would be a very valuable tool for in the classroom. It would allow students to learn to there greatest ability because it will be able to effectivily modify the lesson when one is confused. It would allow the higher members know if a student was also having trouble and needed talked to. Yes the Facial Action Coding System would be of good use in the classroom.

D2F937C1BF96,"In my personal opinion I would say that the technology to read other people emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not a good valuable. The Facial Action Coding System wouldn't be a good valuable because why would school bother buying the Facial Action Coding Sysytem for their student just to check if they happy or not. Instead of buying Facial Action coding System they should buy school material,books or even online websites for kids to learn,because kids really wouldn't like a computer checking them out if they are happy or sad.

Students wouldnt like to go to school knowing that almost everyday that there going to check their emotions. Everyday there are people that go to school sad,depressed,happy, and exited and those people dont wat to tell other people how they feel like. Even if those people try to fake smile theey wouldn't get away without it because in the article it say's ""In a false smile,the mouth is streched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. So this means that it can detect a fake smile because of our face muscle called orbicularis pars palpabraeus.

Even though it's kinda a cool invention but it shouldn't be for students or schools because sometime students want to fix here emotion by themselve or sometimes they don't want anyone to see that person emotion. My own opinion the Facial Acting Coding System should be used in places like in therapy or somewhere just related to behavior but it wouldn't be a good value in a school.

I would say i am on both sides. i say that because i think it could be a good thing but i also think there would be sone bad things with that too. One reason why it would be good is to see if the person is just not happy at all then you could talk to them and see whats going on with them. So you can see if you can fix it. Another reason why i think its a good thing is because it tell the peron your doing it to and you how there expressions are. I also fill like this could be a good thing because if the person is going threw a hard point in their life then this would be good. The reson why this could be good is because then you could help them out before they do anything to them self. another thing that this would be good for is if you r going to go do something and the other person has a expression on there face you cant tell how they feel about it then yoiu can use this technology to see if it bothers them or not. There was a claim in the story that they figured how the person felt before doing something.

Now, there is some reasons i think this could be bad. I think it could be bad because the parents of the kid or the kid himself may not like you doing this sort of thing on him. This is why im kinda on both sides because if they wont done to them I could understand that so thats why i think its fine to not do it if you don't want to. They might not want you to because they might just not want you to know about some of there personal life.

192587AF5D13,"This idea i think is very usefull for teachers now, its bad enough we cant understand a persons mood. It is bad because someone could be sad or angry but the person wont say anything to get it out of his or her system. If we had this system it would be great to know wether a student is okay, fine or depressed. The fact that we already know six characterisitc movements means that we can probably find more. The six basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.

The bad things about the emotion detecting system is that it could mess up some how and it would tell the teacher that this kid is sad but he is happy. The machine could be really expensive and schools wouldnt even be interested in buying these systems. The system could probably pick up other emotions that are not propriate and the kid would feel embarrased. Why would a teacher really want this system anyways.

DA61A6F47A15,"I don't agree with using this technology to read students emotional expression. I think it wouldnt be a machines business to know how your feeling because some people like muself sometimes dont want to know how you really feel. For example. if I was feeling down one day about my dog passing away, and my little sisters want me to take them to the park. Im gonna stay as positive and happy as possible so it doesnt ruin their day. I would take them to the park making it seem like im happy, then eventually be happy myself after the fun we have. I wouldnt want some machine telling me or other people my emotions because thats my business.

Our emotions belong to us only and we choose for people or other things to know how we feel when we want to.

I am not the only one who sometimes hides the way they feel for a bit. We all know if you try to stay positive and have a good day that you will get over no matter what the situation is bringing you down. If you stay positive and happy, then it will all go away eventually instead of expressing how you feel and staying depressed or crying all day.

It seems like this technology can be useful or pretty cool to use on histroical people. Like who wouldnt want to know how Abe Lincon felt when he took his picture to be on the dollar bill. That would interest me by alot. Only because that is history and its very intersting, but using it everyday of your life can be really annoying and show less privacy. It is a good way to cheer people up like if a friend was feeling down and didnt want to tell you how he or she felt at the moment. That is understandable, but like i explained all you have to do is asume that they are feeling down and cheer them up the best you can and carry on with the day. Eventually they will be back to they're old self again.

Knowing how someone feels right off the top can be annoying for some people like myself. It can cause others like myself to feel very uncomfortable and not wanting to express how they feel because some machine does it for you. Maybe some people want to express how he or she felt a few days after they felt down or depressed. I highly disagree with thus technology being used in our everyday lives to see how we feel, although it would be very nice and interesting to use this technolgy on histroical pictures like the famous Mona Lisa or how President Abe Lincon felt on the dollar bill photo.

4FFC4DB08B42,"I claim this technology because when it scans somebody face it can tell us the percentage of out facial expressions. For an example Mona Lisa demonstrates that is really surprising to bring a simlie to your face while the computer shows you based on much percentage of happiness you have right now. Another example is that the facial technology had a lot of different movements that can track your facial face movements. Because it all about the muscles in your facial face. They even indicate the difference between a genuine simlie and a force one. You can imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad or angry or even fear. For example, if you simlie when a web ad is on your screen a very similar ad will pop up again. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Based on how you act.

Having this new technology would be a better fit with the people because when is feeling down and the other person don't know on how they feel they always use the facial technology to show the percentages of how down they really are.

It's also important to be able to recognize facial expressions and the different types of muscle movements. This new type of technology can also be used to improve school systems. The Facial Action Coding System is of value to use on reading students' emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System can regonize how a student may be feeling. This could be beneficial for teachers and councilors because then they could help the student with any emotional problems they may be having. The technology, ""can even identify mixed emotions"". Mixed emotions can show a mix of happiness and sadness at the same time because people's emotions aren't always clear, and people can appear as something they are not. Facial expressions for each and every emotion are diverse.

Recognizing facial expressions and different muscle movements can help determine how someone is feeling. Instead of, ""we humans perform(ing) this same impressive ""calculation"""", we humans can use a more reliable source. The Facial Action Coding System can, ""handle the complex algorithms used to decode"". It can, ""indicate the difference between a geniune smile and a forced one.""

If, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", then a teacher or staff member can better help that student or excite the class. Or, ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". The learning process can be made more entertaining and enriching to students.

Having technology to read students' emotional expressions in school is vauble.

When you are in school do you ever feel bored? We all do sometimes that is just how things work. Now do you think that if our computers could tell if we were bored that it would make the lesson any more exciting. The lessons that we are taugh are mostly given to the teachers or the teachers make it. If our computers think that we are bored of the lesson it wants to change that. How does that happen? The teahcer would have to make more than one lesson to teach the class. There are also things that are just completely boring at school there can not be a way to make them any better.

Then there is also one or two good things about it like if it were able to detecte if someone were not feeling very good about themselves. They might need help but not come out and say it, this technology could help with that. If you put this in a school you would just get a lot of stressed out faces that have to much homework to do while still trying to have a life.

This technology can help prevent more teenagers/children committing suicide. This is especially important because everyday teenagers commit suicide due to the fact that they are getting bullied at school, feeling sad, have depression issues, and have suicidal thoughts or actions. The technology can help prevent this because it detects if a person or student is sad, happy, depressed, mad, or having suicidal thoughts. Everyday parents and everyone in this world lose their children/teenagers from suicide. If students all around the United States of America stopped bullying each other we wouldn't have so many teens committing suicide every year.

The more people get used to this the better because then the people that made these computers will begin to make more of them because people will begin to want to buy more of them. There can also be disadvantages to this because some people will begin to not make communication with other people they will just think it's okay to talk to a computer. I still feel like this is a great piece of technology but they should adjust it so that people won't just want to be with a computer all day.

F6F766C1BDD2,"Do i believe use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuble?

no because a friend can tell when your sad,sometimes the computer can be wrong,and some people look like they are angry but are actually happy.

Technology is not valuabe for studnets expressions in classroms because a friend would know if you are down or happy or depressed the computer can't see tears on the inside they also don't know your life. An example is""a kid who is bi-polar they could be happy the one second,then boom anry the next second"". You mean to tell me a computer can't tell if your'e angry one second then happy another second? Another example could be sometimes you just don't know if that person is sad,happy,angry and sometimes the kid doesn't wangt to talk about his or her emotions"". i believe this can prove that the computer doesn't know if the kid is happy or sad,but the friend will!

The use of technology can't read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom becaue the computer is not always correct about everything. An example is ""a game like NBA 2k18 they can scan your face,but it doesn't look just like you"". Another big example is ""the computer isn't always the right answer just like the internet the answer doesn't always come out right so the computer won't get your emotional feelings right.""

Another reason the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom isn't valuable because a lid could look angry but is actually happy. an example is ""sometimes i look angry but tkats just my normal face,so the computer would say i'm angry when i'm really happy"". Another examle is ""a kid could have a dissorder on his or her expression so once again the internet is wrong"". this proves that the computer cannot read the emotional expressions of students in class.

As i stated in the text all those examples prove that my eviedence prves that using computers to express whether the use of technology reads the students emotional expressions. they can't because the computer doesn't know if the kid is happy or, mad, a friend can tell when they are mad,and sometimes the internet is wrong.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

With this advanced technology students will just keep changing if there smiling, if their mad, sad, glad, etc. and checking if the technology can actually do its job. Teachers would probably be doing the same and would not be focused on teaching instead focused on a laptop or computer that can read emotions. Emotions are shown everywhere whether your sad or happy anyone can tell by the way your acting or the way you look. We dont need technology to tell us how we feel or how were supposed to feel. What if the technology tells you a wrong emotion, like what if your happy but it says your mad. Then that'll be the people that made it mad. If we could actually have technology that does that like when a add pops up and you get mad then another one pops up and your happy then another one could pop up and it could be innapropiate.

Using this technology properly is the safest way to do it, but. I believe that using in a classroom full of students can be a disaster, i am a student myself. It's why i perfer not to be emotionally monitered throught these computer, most likley because alot of things happen putside of school that teachers arn't aware of. So using that type of technology on students, the'yre emothion would constanly be changing due to being around drama in and out of school. Another reason this would not help the students is because they need to learn how dectect these emotions themselves, and so do the teachers. Using this type of technology can help our courts determine wether a criminal is guilty or innocent. We could use this in way to get people out of danger, such Zologist. they feed and tame animal to be less aggressive, if this computer can detect emotion, then it can help avoid attacks from wild animals. This technology is impressive and can be used in different forms to make things better around us, they can make life easier and get us farther in future. being able to make computers that can detect emotion, can make a robot detect when its being theatened, can see when criminals are up to somthing. technology like this can help us get farther then the planets we know now. I my opinion on this is, i can agree it is an amazing invetion, and can be used an a lot of good, and bad ways its just the way people see on using it. we can both beleive that it should be used to get are nation farther then it already is, but lets not let are own technology controls us.

It would help so many people that are depressed and need help but afrad ask for it. And when people get help with their emotions they become more stable then they were before.

Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile. You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile. When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori. But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth. The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.

This is way i think we should use this technology in the futer. It could help with so many things. People could get the help they need.

I see it everyday at in the world .Like for explain when someone die and they go to a furel you got to look cool or happy ,but on the inside your heart broken and never be the same . And you take a picture on a computer and it would say you are happen but you really not because computer don't know emontional they just know knowledge .

I mean don't get me wrong it a good tool it see people emotional . But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things .We dont need computer to see people emotional we can tell by the way a person talk . If that person sound like he or she got a additon (come back) that mean that person is in a bad mood and don't want to talk at that time . A computer wouldn't even know he or she in a good mood or not by the way they talk. Another good reason why it's not valuable.

Does computer even have emotional?

I don't think so but they can't tell people emotinal . Compuer don't know what true happence or sadness mean they just tell us whatever they programer put inside them. True happness is something you don't feel its just there . Sadness is somthing thats doesn't feel good something that hurts on the inside.

So yea computer really can't read people expressions just from the face .

I think the use of this in a classroom is going to workout great for the students and the teachers. If you have the Face Action Coding System in the classroom the teachers can scan the faces of there students will the teacher is teaching them a lesson. After it scans the faces of the students the teacher can then see if the students are enjoying the lesson or if they aren't enjoying. This could change the way teachers teach kids by doing stuff creative different days so the kids will enjoy what they are being taught. Instead of being upset about what they are learning.

This is also a good idea for teacher as well to see if there students are having a hard time or if they are upset about something. Some kids don't like to talk about what they are upset about unless someone ask them first. The face scaning decive will be a helpful thing to put in a classroom. plsu while your face is geting scanned you have to make a happy face therefore the experiment will make you slightly happy. I think they should start putting these in the classrooms now.

Having these in the class will make kids want to learn and the teachers will be able teach the kids because the kids will be focused. It will be a great thing to have in a school it's always good to see the emotions of the kids in the classroom. Even for the teachers if the teacher is uspet the students can see his emotions with the face scanner. All in all i think they should start putting them in classrooms.

The process begins when the computer constructs a three-dimensional computer model of the face. All forty-four major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" The facial expressions we use for each emotion is universal. The software can identify mixed emotions.

The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. He then relies on his pyschologist Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it tells us how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. ""Why would they want this?"" Some students could use this software on there computer to use for when they have no one to talk to, to use for homework like instead of looking it up on the internet they could say,""hey computer what is two plus two.""

They will make a certain facial expressin such ass raising there eyes macking a weird light smile or smurk. These signs of facial reaction or movement of the face will be able to tell if somone is lieing or telling the truth.

The author gives us examplse of how to tell these claims. He gives us the distinked signs to look for to back the argument. Such as he tells us the facial expresions are very universal. Meanig that not just one person can have that facial expresion in the world.

9F2336DE1875,"Imagine having a piece of technology tell you how you're feeling. I do not think that the use of technology to read our emotions would be valuable in a classroom. If they were used, the students may get mad, it could be a bother to the teacher, or it would be costly and takes regular upkeep.

If technology was used in classrooms, it would not be valuable. The students in the classrooms sometimes want to hide how they feel about someone or something, and having a machine track what they feel, could trigger them. A student can sometimes hide their anger about a student or assignment, but if this was applied, it would be obvious. Another reason they wouldn't be valuable is because if it reads the wrong emotion of someone, they person's anger or emotion may rise and become an even larger ordeal. Someone can already tell what is felt just by looking at someone's face for the most part, as the author stated in paragraph 5, so there is no point to have to have a machine do the same thing. A friend would be also able to see if you are faking a smile or hiding what you really feel. The teachers also are another reason they wouldn't hold any value.

A second reason that the machine is not worth it is because of the teachers responses. A teacher may now see how a student feels about something and this could lead to more disiplinary issues. The teacher may feel annoyed if the students become amused and there would not be a point to teaching. In paragraph six, it says, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" and this shows that they are becoming like a teacher and this could lead to a decrease in available jobs, kind of like what is happening with robots. The placement of these machines in classrooms could cause more stress on teachers and more to worry about on top of the student's needs. They aren't only a bad idea because of the teachers and students, but also the upkeep.

The final reason they should not be placed in classrooms is because of the price and upkeep. The machines would not be a cheap purchase and the schools have better items to buy for the school. The school my have to hire more people to make sure they are always working and this is also using more of the schools money. The device would be like any other piece of technology and would also require updates. The ""Da Vinci Code"" would not be totally accurate every time, and that could lead to a disruption. Nick D' Alto says, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" which shows how complicated the machine is and how easily it could misinterpret emotions.

323F0A82AA38,"A new source of technology haas been invented that has the power to enable computers to indentify human emotions. This is called the Facial Action Coding System. The first step of the computer is to construct a 3-D computer model of the persons face. This includes all 44 muscles on a human's face as well. They must move exactly as if they were human muscles for the experiment to work. Six emotions have been classified by the model that are the most common expressions of a person in their daily life. These would be happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are all also associated with each and every movement of the facial muscles. The new created technology seems to be valuable to the people that use it today and specifically would have a value for students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track facial movements with the new emotion-recognition software created in the system. It weighs every unit and can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared to a face that show no emotion also clled a neutral face. Dr Huang commented in the artile ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" that he believes "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". This could be a great use to teachers in their classrooms so they know what to explain more on and for which student. As a student, I can assure anyone that the worst thing at school in a class is when you can't understand something. When a student is completely confused, they can loose intrest and also motivation to comprhend what's going in in class. Dr Huang also added that ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"".

This new technology comes with many benifits and advatages for all people of different ages. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students and teachers at school during the day.

3F4A655BBF22,"Teaching in a classroom setting is something that has been happening sucessfully for centuries now, dating way way back before technology was even being thought about. This goes to show technolgoy is not needed, but maybe sonetimes helpful. In a classroom setting peices of technology such has things like computers can be super helpful when doing things such as writing an essay, and acessing information online, however when taken too advancely it can become more of a joke, and a distraction to students. That's where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The Facial Action Coding System theoretically seems to be a good idea but in reality it's an expensive toy. There are many other proven effective ways to teach in a classroom, and somethings are boring to learn about but you still have to know them, so just sit still, relax, and learn.

The first thing you notice when walking into a classroom is usually the students who are choosing not to spend their time wisely rather than the students who are. This is because students who choose be off task are often distracted by technolgy and gaming which is a lot more noticable to the human eye. These students are taking advantage of technology provided and using it for bad. So why would we put the Facial Action Coding System in schools when it is expensive and would be used as a toy? That's right, we wouldnt. When used for other purposes we also risk crashing which is another thing that would take up more time rather than taking that time for the students to be taught.

Everybody learns in differnt ways for example take the idea of studying for a spelling test. Some kids learn by writing it down multiple times, some kids learn by hearing it being spelled, others learn best by repeating it. There are so many way for kids to learn so by adding the Facial Action Coding System into schools you're assessing kids on how much they enjoy what they are learning about, and not how much information they are actually gaining. Which bring me to my next point.

Not every kid is going to be excited about everything they learn. Yes, some books are boring, and who wants to learn about what cells are made of, and who cares who invented the lightbulb, but these are all things kids are going to learn anyways. Not everything is going to be fun. sometimes you just need the facts. Making kids excited about a topic all comes from the influences of other people being excited about a topic and feeling that positive energy around them. If a computer screen told you you were bored, it wouldn't make you less bored.

The Facial Action Coding System is not all bad. There are some good parts about it. In the pasage the author talks about how ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" To recognize when a student is confused is a powerful thing, because when more students are confused they don't always like to say it, however the Facial Action Coding System is an expesive way to tell if a student is confused. If a child is confused they should say something. This allows students to build up self-confidence. All in all the Facial Action Coding System has both pros and cons, however the cons over power the pros making this tool not valuable in a classroom setting. It is an expensive toy that should be used for other purposes. Not to say there is no good uses for the Facial Action Coding System, but it is just not valueable in a classroom setting.

The FACS can also detecte when a students is getting bored of a lesson, and will change it to a more pleasing one. It will change to better acommidate the student's needs.

FACS can also help the teachers better understand their own students more. Since the FACS system can read the six basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The FACS system will help the teacher understand what the student need more help with, and what they are more intrrested in.

The FACS system can read the facial muscles, and this is how it can detacte the emotions of people. It can even identify when someone has mixed emotions, and compares each expression with a neutral face. This is how it can regoinze when students are feeling bored, confused, or any other emotion.

This software may be able to tell the teacher when the student is confused, upset, or even when the student is bored and needs a more interactive subject or way of learning.

When a student is confused, they may not ask for help to a teacher. The child may be too shy or nervous to ask for a simple example or explanation. This software program will be helpful because it will be able to read the students confused face and tell a teacher that the student needs help. In the short story in paragraph six it states, ""most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This explains how not all people will use words to explain what they are feeling. These students may never speak up for themselves or have the courage to ask a question without the program being here to help deal with the childs needs.

The Facial Action Coding System will not only help with students life in the classroom, but it may also help with a students feelings deeper within. The software will be able to pick out the students who are very upset, and need to talk about their emotions to another person. If a student has a sad face in class, the program may be able to identify what is wrong with the child, and it could notify this information to a teacher or a well trusted adult. In paragraph five of this story it states, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" By having this computer software, it could help out with a students mental emotional feelings as well.

This program will also be very helpful in providing a fun learning environment for the students. In the middle of paragraph six it explains how a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored. It also states that if you smile when a website advertisement pops up on the computer screen it will show more advertisements like that one. If a person frowns when this pops up, it willl show a different, more appealing advertisement. This can be very useful in a classroom. It may make the students more interested in learning. The students might even be more excited to learn now, because the computer will know that the students happy facial experssions mean they are enjoying the type of way the program is teaching them.

6AD39619EC45,"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems could be very useful. There are several reasons for this. First of all there are several industries ot can be used in. Secondly it could help students get a better education. The last reason is that it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also drawbacks to using a computer software to read people's emotions.

Several industries would benefit from this software. As the article mentions artists are required to be able to recognize the facial expressions of the people they are painting or drawing. These expressions are critical to conveying the correct emotions, so clearly the art industry could benefit from the use of Facial Action Coding Systems. Another way industy that this software could be used in is politics. The article talks about how the software can recognize the difference between a fake smile and a real smile. This could be useful when analyzing political figures as well as celebrities. A possible downside to this is cost effectiveness. The question of is the cost really worth it whenever there are already people in the world that can do the same thing.

Another useful aspect of the Facial Action Coding System is it's use in schools. In the article Dr. Huang, the co-developer of the system, says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, likean effective human instructor."" This could be the most useful aspect of the software, because not everyone learns in the same way. If your computer could recognize when you were getting bored or confused and then fix the problem it would make learning much easier for a lot of people. It would also allow students to move at their own pace as not everyone works at the same speed. A downside to this software is the loss of jobs for teachers as well as the reliance on technology.

The last aspect is that it could make advertisements more relevant. The article states that if you smile when an internet ad appears on your screen, another similar as might follow. However if you frown, the next ad will be different. This is useful both for the consumer and the company. We all know that when an annoying ad pops up it usually gets ignored especially if we've already seen that ad one hundred times. But what if the ad was for something you actually liked then you might go buy it. The only negative about this is that the software won't recognize if you're smiling about the video you just watched or the ad that pops up.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System could possibly be very useful in the future. There are many industries where it could be used, schools could use it to make education more beneficial and it could make advertisements more relevant. However there are also a few issues which should be adressed before it could be used in mainstream businesses and schools. ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent
2E345725190C,"Are you against of this technology to read people's mind? I am against it because there are people out there that suffer and want to get over their life. If that technology read their mind and the world knows it they will suffer more and never get over it. Also, there are many good reasons to agree it and there are many reasons that I disagree. The technology might ruin every person's life.

In addition, I disagree with this technology because in the text, third paragraph says in order to read the expressions your face bone has to be different, but there are a lot of emotions that people don't show, you might be happy or sad and your face still the same. I don't think that tecnology can comprehend people's emotion and people's mind. Basically, the third paragraph says that emotion are base on your bones but I notice when I am sad, happy, disgust or mind blank my face is the same: a face that's blank minded. Most people can't read my mind and I don't think the technology can either.

Another reason that I don't agree with technology reads mind is because there are people who don't want people to know what's in them. For example, if there's a girl is unhappy and in order to make her friends to be happy she do everything and maybe no one will notice and her friends will be glad for her. If the technology reads her minds and let her knows about it, their friendship might be in chaos and ends.

Also, why I am disagree with it because I remeber one time my teacher told me that science is not always 100%. I don't think this technology is accurate because I notice when one of my friend is sad I can tell by the way she talks but not her expressions. In the text says that not only your facial muscles knows your emotion but also produce them, but what if your bone is twisted and have an unhappy seems face but you are actually happy. The article says that facial muscles produce emotion, I disagree with it because when I feel sad or blank most of the time my facial bones still the same.

In conclusion, this technology shouldn't invented because it might not be accurate and says false about people expresson. This technology can only read expression only by bone but not voice or heart so I don't think it's accurate. That's why we shouldn't use this technology because science is not always 100% correct. We should get to know the person's mind better instead of use technology to know theirs. If you don't know what's in them then, that means relationship is not close and it's better to learn their minds and know each other better.          ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent

It could help alot of students like if they get bored or tired of the lesson. All schools should get this type of tecnology in their computers.

First, if all schools had this computer software it could help tell if a student is getting bored of the lesson the computer would know to make it more interasting. If all the student were just bored of the lesson all the time they would just not pay any attention and fail. If the computer had the software it would have able to detect that and spice it up. Then there would be way less students failing and injoying what they were learing.""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused ot bored"".

Next, it could help detect if a sudent was sick so they nurse would know weither to send them home or not.""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". If a student asked to go to the nures and said they were sick the nurse would be about to tell if they were with the computer software. So know there would be less people getting sent home. Since students would only get sent home if they really were sick then they would do better in school becasue they would be there more. They would also have a better attendance record since they are missing way less,

Finally, this type of technology could help with decipline in schools all around. If a student was sent to the office for something he or she did the person in charge would be able to tell if they telling the truth. This could help so many students not get in toruble becasue if they were actually telling the truth they would know.""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"".

I also backed this from the article because it mentions that a classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoing confused or bored.

I think it pointless, because nobody will speak up on how they feel in the classroom infront of everyone in there. It would probably say how they feel out loud, and maybe someone doesnt want to be pointed out. ""You can tell how someone feels by their actions and look on their face"", I don't think they'd need a ""robot"" to understand how someone feels in that exact moment. I think teachers or whoever themselves should go up to that person and have a proivate conversation, some teachers see the facial expressions on some students and wont bother to ask. I feel like the technology would be expensive as well and they would need a lot of them. It would just be a waste of money. Plus, it goes by your facial expressions. I don't believe it would actually tell you how you feel.

Also, once the technology tells you how you feel what's going to make it better. How can the ""Mona Lisa demonstration bring a smile to your face by just looking at it"".

First, people have many different emotions. Most of humans would have trouble describing each favial trait. Whenever someone tightens their lips that mean that they are in anger. Computer can recognize the subtle facial movements that human use to express how they feel. When someone make a movement of one or more muscles that is called ""action unit.""

While this could be true, there are a lot of questions that should be asked before this technology can be implemented, such as it's effectiveness and privacy.

The sixth paragraph says how the computer can know if you're happy or sad, and gives an example ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad may follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This seems to be very helpful, but what if said person was smiling about something else? what if the person remembers something funny that happened the other day and suddenly they notice they keep getting uninteresting ads that pop up? There would be no way for the computer to tell if it was really the ad that made the person smile. Another issue is how it is used in class. Paragraph six states ""A classroom computer could recognize if a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" How would the computer tell what degree a pupil is confused? If a student looks a little confused, the computer may read this and respond as if the student was very confused, thus wasting the student's time with more help than they need. One more way to look at it is the privacy violations the software may bring. What if a student is opposed to a teacher being able to technologically and truthfully read the students emotions? does the computer take a log of the faces of the students?

For these three reasons I plan to despute why I disagree with Nick D'Alto about implameting this kind of software into education.

First, I disagree with Nicks idea because its an invation of privacy. Imagen that you were in elementary school again and this tech was installed. You would go through the day with this unconfortable sensation that you are constantly being watched but whats even worse is that your thaughts are also being monetered. imagen your children in this situation.

Third, I don't agree with D'Alto's claim because I don't respect the idea of robbing next generations the right to interact with an actual human teachers. If we allowed this tech we would deprive human contact from kids at such a young age.

First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?

NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform.

They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.

Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
86CBCF98F277,"In the Story ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" The face on mars has apparently been founded in 1976, NASA claimed the the face was formed by a alien, Here is were I come in, The world had made a bunch of movies including aliens from mars, Mars, for hundreds maybe thousands of years have been the 'Aliens home'. Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution.

That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.

huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. huge rock formation...."" It basically says that the rock is a formation "".......giving the illusion......"" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth. I clearly gives out that opinion that if you put it together you get ""A huge rock formations giving the illusion........."" and so on.

I also think that The 'face' Is just a rock the looks like a face, clearly I stated that. Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...""over time it transformed ....."" in the text... ""Huge rock FORMation.""

A9B3A7E0379B,"Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". Shadows on the object give ""the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.

The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.

Some people still believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is the work of aliens. I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is not the work of aliens, but a natural landform.

The article gives good evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another weird natural landform on Mars. In paragraph 5, conspiracy theorists claim the ""Face on Mars"" is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide. In paragraph 3, NASA unveiled the image for all to see in 1976. The caption noted, ""a huge rock formation...which resembles the shape of a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars; which it certainly did just that. The authors of the article wanted to attract attention towards Mars and NASA even claimed that it was a huge rock formation in the caption. Later, stating that shadows gave the huge rock formation the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper and clearer than the original Viking photos. The picture taken in April of 1998, would most likely not have shadows to give illusions of the face, nose, and mouth. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. NASA again stating and proving that the ""Face on Mars"" was just another out of place natural landform on Mars. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."" Here again we can see NASA trying to prove that the ""Face on Mars"" in still just a weird natural landform on Mars. Someone who stills believes that the ""Face on Mars"" is the work of aliens might say something like this. The ""Face on Mars"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim. However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001. The photo taken in April 2001, the weather was perfect-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The photo taken that year still looks like a natural landform on Mars.

892923AC5CF2,"Have you ever seen the face on Mars? Well, if you have, do you think it's a real face, or that aliens made it, or that it's just a natural landform like the ones we have here? The answer is, that it's just a natural landform. This face that we see on Mars is just a landform that was created over time. Just like the natural landforms created here on Earth. Things like the Rocky Mountains, or as it says in the passage, the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

This face on the surface of Mars had unusual shadows casting down on it, making the face look like an old Egyptian Pharaoh. Many people though didn't believe NASA, so on April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture of this mysterious face that was ten times sharper than all the previous pictures ever taken. When the photo was uploaded to the internet, thousands of people were disappointed when they found out that this was just a natural landform, not something alien made.

In conclusion, in the year of 1976, a face was spotted on the planet of Mars. This face was said to be the creation of aliens who were living on the planet. Many people were disappointed when they found out the truth. That this mysterious face was just a natural landform created over time. Even after NASA confirmed that this was just one ordinary landform, people still weren't convinced. So, on April 5,1998, an MOC team went out to Mars, and took pictures that were ten times sharper than all the originals. Thes pictures proved that this was just an ordinary landform that was formed over time. This ""face"" is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa her on earth found in the American West. Chief scientist for the NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says that the face found on the surface of Mars is actually about the same size as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

C52C3ED718AD,"In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the ""Face on Mars"". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.

When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that ""the Face"" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that ""the Face"" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.

Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture ""huge rock formation..."" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of ""the Face"". The articles states the the image was ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"". This image proved that ""the Face"" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.

So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph ""on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"". It also says ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West"". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.

The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that ""the Face"" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars.

62D1014CFDFA,"When people first say this ""face"" it was from a picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took. Additional reasearch and pictures have been done to see if this is actually a face, just a huge rock formation, or an alien monument. It has shown that it is just a huge rock.

I say its only a huge rock because the passage mentions unusual shadows. THese shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth causing it to look like a face. They did not just form any

""face"" that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So we know now that t was just a huge rock formation with shadows on it. It is not an actual face carved into rock.

The passage mentions that Michel Malin and his MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the same landform only ten times shaper thn the original. When they looked at this picture it revealed a natural landform. So after all this it wasnt an alie monument after all.

Now the image doesnt show a face and its not an alien monument it is a butte or mesa. Those are commo landforms aroung the american west. So we know for sure not that the ""face on mars"" is actually just a landform with a bunch of shadows that give the illusion of a face.

If you look at the picture of the Face, you can see the black shadows on the figure, if you were to remove those shadows, it would most likely not look like a face anymore. The passage says ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadowss that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The passage also says ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Key word, illusion.

On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars.

I think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet. If life was on Mars, we would know by now.

The first reason is that all this time from when they first took the picture to the last time they took the picture it has never been touched or even looked like it was messed by anyone.

Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the ""human Face"". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do.

No, twenty five years ago, our Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.

The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument.

Earth is covered in these mesas so more than likely other planets including Mars probably have buttes and mesas, its just coincidentall that it looks like a face. With the other pictures it proves that the mesa isn't an alien artifact and just a natural landform.

If you go out to the Rocky Mountains and look around you can probably see tons of Mesas maybe not as big ,but they are still the same natural landform. The mesa is big and does look like a face at first glance ,but there is no way you can prove it. But for scientists you can back it up with facts not just opinions.

If you look at the image taken from the spaceship Viking 1 from 1976 you can see that only looks somewhat similar to a face. And then 22 years later a picture from a Mars Global surveyor you can see that it very clearly isn't a face and instead just a natural landform.

The only way that this could be an alien artifact is if the martians are inside of it or underneath it. That would explain how the camera can not see any other buildings around the object because they are all inside of it so no one is outside. They also could be inside of the butte because the planet is deadly for some paticular reason and they have shelter inside safely away. And another reason is because inside of the planet there may be some source of running water that is keeping them alive.

Although this could not work because they more than likely would have gotten a picture of a martian outside doing something. And they would need some source of water which has already dried up on the outside of the planet.

In the end it is not possible that the mesa is an alien artifact and is instead just a butte or a mesa that happens to like a face. Because the clearer picture shows that it now looks nothing like a face, water stopped flowing on the red planet a long time ago, and Earth also has these land forms all over the place.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
13EBA3BE41C2,"Have you heard of the photo taken in 2001 that revealed a strange, unusual, ""Face on Mars?"" In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars in search for a landing spot for its sister ship. During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.

The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..."" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.

Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.

In conclusion, the picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa. I believe that this was an amazing discovery and gave us, NASA scientist, a challenge to go out and find evidence to prove conspiracy theorists's accustuations. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C79753F72EF8,"If it was an object created by aliens then why would they turn that landform into a human face. There have never been any reports of someone coming close to an alien face to face. Also how would the aliens know what humans look like, they have never even been to earth before. All that face is, is a rock with shadows from the sun to make illusions to the human eye.

The face was used in grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Yes, you may think think aliens did it and there is a chance they did, but that chance is very slim. yes, some scientist did believe it was an alien artifact but that was before they had HD cameras and now we can see the rock clearly. Garvin said that ""If there were objects in that picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were"".

In conclusion, there is no evidence that aliens have created that face and if there was, NASA would do all that it could to prove it a farce. Do not believe everyhting you see online or in books. You might just become too attatched to that topic.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
95830A1822AA,"People believe that this natural landform that looks like a face on mars was done by aliens. Well it wasn't. If it was aliens we would tell you because it would be a benefit for us. People on earth see natural landforms that look like certian things all the time. Not to mention it looked like such a face because the shadows that it casted made it more detailed.

If it was aliens it would benefit us. Like the text states, ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars."" But its not. The text comes back afeterwards and says ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" If it was an ancient alien statue we would say it and back it up, because it would have a highly strong benefit towards NASA because we could get donations for it. Along with more popularity.

Not only would it benefit us, but it looks like natural landforms all across the world. The text even states, """"It reminds me most ofMiddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."""" Not only that but it mentions, """"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the face on mars.""""

Why not ask questions about landforms that look detailed or look like aliens may have done it on earth?

The main reason the face looked the way that it did was because of the shadows that it casted. The text tells us, ""Shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The text also tells us, ""Because of its face like structure it become a great attraction. Starring in films, books, magazines and other articles."" If it weren't for the shaddows then what was the point.

What if NASA is lying? What if none of this is true? WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BELIEVE US? People should believe NASA because again this all would benefit NASA. The text even states, ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" Not to mention, if it was a sign of human life it would show a dramatic increase of popularity.

So no it isn't an alien statue, or a sign of ancient alien civilization. If it was we would tell you so we could have a benefit or major profit. On Earth we have natural landforms all around that look like actual things made by aliens. Why not question them about those natural landforms? Not only that, the only real reason it looked like a face was because the shadows it casted made it look like it had a mouth, eyes, nose, and other facial features.

EBBC9006CE52,"In 1976 NASA'S Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor had taken a picture of a face-like form on Mars.

The area that this was found in is common for having these types of forms.

This land form was found in Cydonia, a region on Mars.

This form on Mars is a natural land form, although many people thought it to be created by aliens.

This thought had sparked sudden interest into the people about Mars, when it was released to the public.

Scientists had further looked into it and found it was just a land form.

However, somone had still thought that this was created by extra terestrials because they knew it was winter in Cydonia, so it was cloudy.

They stated that they thought the clouds could have blocked off many features of this land form.

They also thought that if you had taken a clearer picture then you would see many other features explaining that another life form had created it.

The same picture was later on taken in 2001.

This picture had many more pixels to show an HD picture of the object.

This updated picture showed a much more smooth and almost dome-like formation instead of a face.

This led many scientists to believe that this is a natural land form.

Some of the rock's features still had resembled a little bit of a human face.

Before NASA could know for sure wether this was natural or not they made the face on Mars a priority to take more pictures and find where it is and when they did, they had found that yes, it was just simply a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA had seen a face on Mars and couldn't figure out what it was so they took more pictures as the technology advanced.

This allowed scientists to know for sure that this was a natural thing.

Many people are still convinced that this is an extra teresrial creation and thet Ancient Eqypt had truely been crated by these creatures considering the fact that this face looks like and ancient pharoa from around those exact times.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

In my opinion, scienctificly we should believe there landforms and not aliens. We should believe Scientist at NASA,because they have facts and pictures that look like faces made of landforms. Scientist claim they know the facts of what looks like a landform and they think this is a posibility that this is one of them. Also, We should believe its landforms because nobody has ever seen aliens before they just think that they look like on what they have on social media etc. Even if they look like what we have in pictures that still would NOT be an aliens face!! If you look at the picture it might actually look like a formed face but its not .We should also believe NASA because .. they are scientificly trained to look at these and study things to see and know what they are .. Why would you really believe and think you know whats on the internet instead of believing things that you see! Use research!

In conclusion,I think the face is a landform because if so , aliens do not look like humans and the faces on mars looks like a human face and i think we should stop assuming and go with the facts from NASA.            ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
BE9761F227C5,"The face on mars. The space craft Viking snapped a photo of what look a human face on mars. The face is two miles long from end to end. Many conspiracy theorists think that the face is alien made. The face is not alien made though.

The theorists wanted to know proof that it wasn't alien made. So April 5,1998 the Global Surveyor flew over the face and took a picture ten times shaper than the first picture. Thus you could see that the face was formed not by aliens but by natrual formation.

The theorists where still not happy about the photo take. On the that day mars had a dust strom that day so the picture kinda had a haze to it. So the mission controllers had to prepare to take another picture. So they did and on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day on mars the picture was took.

Once agian the picture showed that there were no alien houses or monuments. The picture was taken with absolute maximum resolition. So you could see every little detail on mars.

A4DF17FA6152,"For those who believe in Aliens, and believe this face is built by aliens, I have some news, its not and i can argue my point in three different ways. Number one, paragrah 10 sates that if there were anything on the ground the camera would of caught it, number 2 is paragrah 11 talks about the cameras ablity to see anything that would help the research of alien life, and lastly paragrah 7 talking about the natural landform.

First, paragrah 10 talks about the difference of the pictures from 1976-2001 with the different pixels. In the fourth sentence it says "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo"". Earlier in the paragraph it talks about the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, meaning the camera NASA has aren't cheap, they are high quality and could see anything that could resemble any alien life, which will be disccused next.

Secondly, in paragraph 11 it talks about the cameras ablity to see anything on the ground such as shacks planes, as is I said in the previous paragraph with the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, this paragrah also says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added.""So, if there objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground Egyptian- style prymaids or even small shacks, acould see what they were!"" Which brings us back to the camera being its best of class,if the camera is able to see anything on the ground that would not be visable to the naked eye, then why didn't it see anythng .

I know most of you would argue that they are storing equiment in the face. But, in the picture the only holes are the eyes and the camera could of seen any other entry point at this angle.

Lastly, paragraph 7 revells the picture of the face on mars, this paragraph talks about the research, and the release of the picture. Yes this eariler in the story but it all falls into place, they state they snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original picture, the image was first posted on the JPL webstite showing a NATURAL land form, no alien momument at all. This dosen't ptove anything since they just posted the picture, but the previous statement i made fall into place with this one supporting my facts of no alien life on the palnet mars asscociating with the face

99216EEE458B,"""Unmasking the face on Mars""

""Big News"" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling

Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.

The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows. The (MOC) has finally released the newest picture which is 10 times sharper than any picture the Viking spacecraft could have taken, and the JPL web seach has revealed tht the face on Mars is actually just another rock formation.

Even though NASA has put the picture out there that proves that the face on Mars is not acually a face but just another land formation, there are still some skeptics out there that think taht the theory is true. Skeptics have said that perhaps since on the day the picture was taken was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet that the alien marking were hidden by the haze. NASA had come to Mars to take a picture of the face at the wrong time and if they were to come another day they might have been able to see that it was an actual face and not just some rock formation.

Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian. Could the butte or mesa landforms be know on other planets besides ours? We are able to get the right size because "" as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" so be comparing the actual size of the butte or mesa to right about the size of the Martian when we do the math. The land formation on earth reminds people most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho "" thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars"".

In conclusion the Face on Mars is just another regular plain old natural landform. "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a shack.""    ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

37C94D59BAAB,"We all know there are 7 wonders of the world, but could this be the first wonder of the universe. Nature can make some astonishing things. Many things in the world, or even the universe, are nature-made. They have been here since the beginning of time even though they seem to be man-made. The ""Face"" should be included in this category. This ""Face"" was created by natural processes.

Similar to the ""Face"", places on Earth are nature-made. Even though sand dunes on beaches are kept by humans, they were first nature-made. Sand storms on Earth create higher dunes in deserts because the starting dune blocks the sand from getting across it. This may be what caused the ""Face"" to be created. There may have been an oval shaped dune at that spot, and, then, a ""storm"" passed by. The beginning dune blocked the Mars sand from exceeding that barrier, and the ""Face"" we see now was created. The shadows forming the eyes, nose and mouth were created on accident.

Sometimes landforms are created when objects collide with planets. The ""Face"" could have been formed when a meteor crashed into Mars. Only this time the crash did not create a crater, but instead a protruding object that over the years got rounded out by storms. Evidence does not suggest that every single meteor strike causes a crater. The reason that craters are an effect on Earth may be due to Earth's atmosphere or it's magnetic field. This may just be the first time NASA has ever seen a mound created by a meteor strike. There could be more out in the universe that NASA hasn't observed yet.

In April of 1998, a photo was taken that was blury due to Martian clouds. Many people exclaimed that the clouds may have blocked some alien markings. When NASA took another photo in April of 2001, the photo does not seem to portray any alien markings. Furthermore, the ""Face"" looked as though it has cracked on the side. Suggesting that there are Martians on Mars and, along with that, there were Martians that made this ""Face"", why wouldn't the Martians fix their monument when it cracks. This led me to believe that not only did the ""Martians"" on Mars not build this, but, additionally, there are no Martians on Mars.

Others may say that, comparative to the Mound Builder Indians on Earth, the ""Face"" was created by Martians bringing dirt to one spot and creating that ""mound"". If that was the case, then how come, in all of the photos and evidence we have from Mars, NASA has never once seen a Martian. They might be hiding from us, but, like Humans, couldn't Martians have messed up, and they forgot to hide one time.

This ""Face"" is created by natural processes. Even though it has been extremely controversial over whether it is alien-made or nature-made, more evidence suggests that the ""Face"" is nature-made. Many things in the universe can cause a mound on a planet, but finding out which one is the cause of the ""Face"" may never be known.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Your first instinct might be that it was made by aliens or creatures we have never seen. Well, this did happen; in 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was flying over Mars and they stumbled upon what looked like a humans face, but they were not positive what or why it was there. This Face is just a natural landform because scientists proved it, there was no sign of abnormal activities, and mesas are not unusual in Mars.

This Face is a natural landform because scientists proved it was not made by aliens. The author states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonai for the first time Micheal Malin and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

Each Pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This exemplifies how scientists used advanced technology to take an accurate picture of the Face. What they found was that it was a mesa.

Again this shows how scientists took advanced pictures and all they saw was a natural landform.

Furthermore, there was not any abnormal activity to prove it was aliens. Gavin said, ""As a rule of thumb you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This shows how the camera was powerful enough to have shown if it was really an alien monument. Similarly, Gavin states, ""So, if there were objects on this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This adds on to the idea that if there had been an alien civilization they would have been able to capture anything that was out of the normal.

Additionally, these landforms are not unusual on Mars. Infact, there are similar landforms on planet Earth. The article states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" This shows how mesas are common in Mars, and they are not strange to be seen. Furthermore, the text states, ""What the picture shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolate mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" This exemplifies how these landforms are not just in Mars, but also on planet Earth. However, this specific landform had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but the picture tooken byThe Mars Global Surveyor proves that it was a natural landform. This camera took a picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Clearly, the Face on Mars was just a mesa. There was no explanation found of how it could have been formed by aliens. First, there was no evidence found that it was an alien artifact; cameras proved that it was a landform. Plus, mesas are not unusual in the planet Mars.

E8F4BD1D7CFB,"The Face on Mars may look like a alien artifact, but in reality, it is just another natural landform. NASA's Viking 1 found a ""human face"" twenty-five years ago on Mars. It was said to be nearly two miles from end to end. Most scientists just thought it was another common Martian mesa. A few days later, NASA put out the image for the world to see. The authors said it was a huge rock formation that resembled a human head. They also mentioned that the shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. It was believed to be just another rock.

Since the story, the ""Face on Mars"" starred in films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Many people thought the Face is evidence of life on Mars, but would soon realize it was just a rock formation. Even a few scientists actually believed that the Face was an alien artifact. After these rumors, photographing Mars became a priority. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped ten pictures. Many anxious people waited for an image to appear on a JPL web site. The image did not reveal a alien monument, but a natual landform.

On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor was taken out for another look at the Face. The picture shows a buttle or mesa; which are landforms common around the American West. Although the Face was believed to be some type of alien artifact, after three times of exploring, it was still proven to be just another natural landform. ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8C4DA60A580E,"The face on Mars is a natural landform. We have proven it here at NASA. We have taken pictures on different years and it has shown to change. Our new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from our Mars GLobal Survey spacecraft reveal the face on mars for what it really is. It is just a mesa. This is common on earth on the west side of the United States. Another reason it wasn't made from any alien or creature out there is because the moniters never found any monuments like that one and aliens moving around.

For people who think aliens did this, say that our camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds which we couldn't see much, think the aliens were probably hiding. people who believe in aliens strongly are going to find the slightest detail and use that for their evidence. Since this was a popluar icon more and more people are going to lie and make up stuff to make sure people believe it is true. They already made up a lie that we would rather hide from the aliens. These people are called conspiracy theorists.

The biggest proof we have that it wasn't made my aliens is our digital image. This was 3 times bigger than the pixel size. It would be able to see if there were objects in this picture like monuments or aliens. It could even see small shacks if there were any. Our spacecraft got to look at it a second time in 2001 and could see more better than the 1976 one. There was still nothing to be found but a natural landform.

Even if we did catch aliens in our picture we showed the same picture to the public for all to see. Nobody said they found an alien structure. If we didn't detect neither would anybody else.

This is why conspiracy theorists will always remain conspiraces. Because they have no soild evidence against us. We have acutul research to back us up. We kept looking at and studying it until we finaly came up with an answer to tell the world what it is.                 ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D26091666C7E,"The Face

The Face that was found on Mars couldn't have been created by aliens. If so where is the proof of these aliens. Ask yourself if you really believe the Face was created by aliens? Dont you believe their would be some sort of evidence after all of the exploring of Mars. In this essay I'm going to write a argumentive explaining why aliens could'nt have made the Face and why I belive it is just a natural landform.

I believe that this Face that was found on Mars could be a natural landform becuase of paragraph twelve. This paragraph says that the Face has resemblance to a butte or mesa, which are common landforms on Earth in the American West. It also states that it has resembalance to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These details are not exactly evidence that the Face is a natural landform, but it gives probable cause to think that it possibly is a natural landform.

For those who feel that the Face was created by aliens, dont you belive their would be some type of evidence of a life form on Earth. As paragraph eleven stated if their were other structures like pyramids, airplanes, or small shacks we would be able to see what they were because we could dicern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If their were aliens I'm sure NASA wouldn't keep it a secret because they would possibly get more donations or money from people wanting NASA to go up and get even more pictures. Or even for NASA to take people up there themselves like a trip.

Those who belive a alien created the face possibly would say that NASA would keep aliens a secret because it would frighten some people. They also could ask the question how and why did the rock or land for the way it did if its just a land form? For the first statement I can say that could be true, but the question I can't answer. I sure that someone who has studied it could though.

The alien belivers can also say that the aliens hide when humans come to Mars but that is something that can't be proven or disproven.

In conclusion, aliens couldn't have made the Face because their should be some type of proof that their has been life on Mars. Especially since we have photos of Mar's surface and have a rover on its surface. I feel that the Face is just a natural landform because it resembles a butte or mesa and because their is no sort of proof that their are aliens or any type of life form on Mars. Alien belivers could ask the question, how was the Face formed like a face, but I can't answer this question.           ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
85299AD4E6AF,"Was the face created by aliens? According to the text, Mar Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1976, eighteen years after the viking mission ended. The Face is just a natural land form because NASA has not identified who could have done it,they only have images and the Face is in the ground whickh makes it a land form.

NASA does not see these faces all the time. Why is this ""landfrom"" one of a kind? Mars has been a planet for years and only has one Face. Which proves that, aliens could have created this. Maybe it is a self portrait, or a sign. The picture of the face was first taken on April 5, 1998. This gives the aliens plenty of times to create the face. On Mar the landforms are remotly the same because of the climate effects everything in a similar way.

NASA believes aliens are real. If NASA has found evidence that aliens may be real, then why don't they think aliens created this? Aliens could be capable of doing this. The Face could be an alien artifact. Maybe there are more underground built by aliens that you can not see.

This is a landform because NASA only has images. Images cn be deciving , I know from experience. This may look like a face, but is not. Sometimes things are not what they seem. In 2001 they had image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 metere per pixel in 1976.

The Face is in the ground. Being attched to the ground, not made by man is a land form. An alien is not a man even if the face is man created. It is simplily just a landform that looks like something that it is not. On Mars there are other land forms, but they just don't look like a face. The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This is not made made which makes it a lanform.

NASA has not identifed who could've made the Face. If NASA takes pictures of Mars then they should have pictures of the ""makers"". Therofore this is a landform or else they would have a picture of who could've created the Face .The Face is located at 41 degree angl north martin latitude. No prof of anyone making it. Must be a land mark because lack of evidense

The Face is a natural landform becuse they only have images, it is connected to the ground, and they have not identifed who could've made it. The lack of evidense has caused me to beileve this. It is a landform on Mars and a pretty cool looking one.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
70DDC8684A15,"The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural occurance. On Mars, there are things called a buttle or mesa. Which in fact, is what this ""face"" really is. I know this because in the article, that was based off NASA's own research, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" We have these landforms on our very own planet, so its understandable as to how we can recognize one on another planet.

On top of that, we used top quality equipment to study and research the Face on Mars. This is backed up by how in the article it says, ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view,' said Gavin. 'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo.""

In the article itself it even says that the face is no alien monument. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform.

Do you think that the "" Face on Mars"" is an alien artifact or is just a natural landform on Mars? Well, in my own personal opinion I believe that it is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, and took 10 pictures to get the perfet shot. I also believe this because, landforms are common around the American West. Although, some my think the picture is an alien artifact, it is not because NASA went back to Mars with an even better camera and, took even more pictures of the Face.

First of all, I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, from their 1976 expidition, to see if the conspericy theories were correct, and they weren't. In the passage it says,"" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origninal Viking photos."" It also says,""

the image first appeared on a JPL wed site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I used these sentences because, they prove that NASA is corret, there wasn't any alien activity.

I believe that the Face of Mars is an natural landform because, landforms are common around the American West. The passage says,"" What picture actually shows is the Martian equivialent ofa butte or mesa- landforms are acually common around the American West."" I used thi sentence because, it shows that the landform wasn't a once-in-a-life-time sort of thing, you see them quite offten actutally. That is also something that people who don't believe NASA never take under consideration.

Some people may believe that the Face is an alien artifact, but in all truthfulness it is a natural landform. I say this because, in 2001 NASA got some amazing cameras to take the best pictures that they could possibly take to prove themselves right. In the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" I used this because, it proves that NASA has worked really hard to get high quality photos of the Face.

In conclusion, I believe the Face is nothing more that a natrual landmark on Mars because, NASA went to Mars to get more pictures, after their mission in 1976, in 1998. I also belive this because, landforms are common in the American West area. Although, some may believe that the Face is an alien artifact it is not because NASA got high qualiy photos to prove it 2001. What do you think the Face is?    ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
6C95EEFE7DAF,"""The Face''

As we all know in the year of 1976 Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo which was belived to be a ""face'' formed in Mar's surface. There has also been arguments over the years if ""the face"" was created by aliens or was it just a natural landform. Here is why I belive it is a natural landform.

In the article ""Umasking the Face on Mars, in paragraph 12 it says what the picture that the picture actually shows that the Martian is equaivalent to a butte or messa which are landforms common around the American West. Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion. Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.

Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.

In conclusion, I belive that ""The Face"" was a just a natural landform. I belive this because of the eveidence that NASA provided and the fact that they went back to space and took anthor picture with up to date technology.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
84FFEF07FB0D,"There are many questions about the mystery of the ""Face on Mars."" The article states that the picture of the Face is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" More information about the ""Face on Mars"" is in the following statements.

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
1D0B32213E00,"Just another day working at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Day's at the Lab went by as any other day for the scientist's, not finding anything new up in space, just a few minor event's here and there, but nothing big. I went in my office, and was informed today we were going to try and find any possible landing site's for Viking 1's sister ship, Viking 2. As usual we went to work. Orbiting Mars for what seemed like an eternity! I'm literally bored out of my mind, until out of the corner of my eye I see something, not just a star or anything, but to my eyes looked like a human face staring right back at us through Viking 1.

Confusion is all us scientist's felt when we saw that face on Mars, just plain fear and confusion. Nothing was spoken much about it among us scientist's since we were all super shocked and speechless, that was until we were on our lunch break. All I heard was ""Alien's"", really alien's can they possibly pin this ""face"" on Aliens! The table next to me also seemed to think alien's made this Egyptian-type face. I dont know what came over me something just clicked and I said ""How can you possibly pin this on alien's?!"" of course this started a one-on-one argument with me and another scientist ""What do you mean, how can it not be Alien's"" he answered. ""First of all, it was spotted near Cydonia, a part of Mars where Martian Mesa's are commonly being found everyday, so how do we not know it isn't just another Mesa?"" ""If you think this is a mesa, how would it take form to look like a human being's face? Dont you think that is too much of a coincidence to happen?!"" at that I left it alone, maybe it was too much of a coincidence, but that wasn't going to affect my thought on the ""Mesa""

The word on the ""Face"" spreaded around the world, becoming a hot topic for people everywhere, most of them thinking it was made by Alien's. I didnt really get much into it until that scientist kid came up to me again, ""Still think it wasn't made by alien's?!"" ""Of course, why wouldn't I?"" ""How can you not think it was alien's! The picture became known to the world and everyone think's it was alien's, which they are probably right!!"" ""How can we know for sure this was created by alien's!? Think about it we dont have great technology yet, that ""Mesa"" was in the form of a face because our photo was too blurry and it was really cloudy!!"" I really didnt want to end up on the wrong foot with this guy so i just walked away.

April 5,1998- I walk into the office and apparently we are going to take a look at Cydonia for the ""Face"" again. This was actually a releif to me, because I know that now our technology is way more advanced and we could see with a sharper picture what this thing really is, a mesa. So it happened Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took a picture ten time's sharper than the old one! As to my conclusion, the egyptian face ended up to be a mesa! This mesa took form of a face because of the shadow's that went over the mesa. As I heard of this new's I couldn't help but look back at that one scientist, and whipering ""Look who the right one is now!"" with the most accomplishing smirk on my face that I can make. ;]",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The face of the pop icon starred in many things. It has been starred in things like hollywood films, radio talk shows, books, magacines, and even frocery stores. It has been in Grocery line for 25 years. People think the face is a ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. They also think of a ancient civilazation on Mars.

While people were suffing on the web, JPL anounced that the face on Mars is just a normal landform. Not everyone was satisfide with the announcement. They still believe of ancient civilazation on Mars. The camera on boradhad to peer through the clouds to see the face.

D9B86C17ED6A,"So, you think that this face on mars, was made by an Alien? Well you thought wrong. There are many reasons why this was not made by an alien. It could be the formation of the land on mars or spacerocks hit it, or it could even be something from inside mars. You dont always know. But Im going to explain why.

Scientist have already went up and discovered this face on Mars because at one time, a lot of people though it was a face made by aliens. Everyone was so excited to see pictures and everything. But some of the information in this article thinks otherwise. In paragraph 7 in this article, it explains how Michael Malin, flew over mars and captured sharper pictures of this ""face. "" But it soon revealed that it was not made by Aliens, it was just a natural lanform and there was no Alien Monuments.

A lot of people were dissapointed, but like I said anything could of happend. The people from NASA took a bunch of pictures and did a lot of tests on it and the picture pretty much said the same thing all along. Plus, Aliens were alive 1000 years ago, if that and so why would people think that they would choose mars, out of all the other planets, and burry an alien in Mars, and it all the sudden show back up. Now do you really think this is true? Now I think it is just a formation in land like the article said.

In the article, some people think that the Alien markings were hidden by haze. Thats a logical reason but I still dont think it is realistic enough. If the haze did not show up in the picture that they took, how could they of not saw it. Plus the Article says that the picture that was most recently took, the lenses on the camera was 10 times sharper and better than the photos that the Vikings photo.

Near the end of the Article it talks about how they even went back again that was even better than the 2 pictures before and that zoomed in so you could see every little detail. Then again it came back with the same results. It was a land formation. They think that it was just a lava dome and has the same formation.

So with all of fthat information I think it is pretty reasonable to say that there was no Aliens on Mars and there deffinataly is not a face from them. This could happen on any other planet to. All along it was just a land formation. At the beggining of the Article I also thought that it was a face from the Aliens too but then I went through the article and there is no possible way. Land forms on its own. So with that being said I guess mars formed with a face on it. Plus rocks and stuff could of made the indents in the face to make it look like eyes.

I hope that was a agreeable argument that aliens were never on mars and proably will never be again.  ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The Face is a natural landform because while the first picture was bluried the second was ten times sharper then the original, the photos are reported to be of a natural landform, scientist say it is a mesa (common in the western U.S).

As I stated before, scientist say the second photo is ten times sharper than the original photo. This means it was more accurate. The article showed the second picture to readers at the top third picture to the right. It shows what looks like, and is ,a natural landform. One scientist, Jim Garvin, compared it to a mesa. A mesa is commonly found in the ""western area of the American West.""

In conclusion, the Face is an all natural landform that formed on Mars. I said that it's natural because the photos (which are more accurate than before) are said to have a picture of an natural landform, which they do. The Face can't be a Martian relic as it is a mesa. If it was of Martian descent wouldn't it look more noticable and detailed? The Face is a natural landform because the first picture shown to the masses was bluried and unaccurate while the second was sharper and more accurate than the original, the second photos are reported to show a natural landform, and scientist say the Face is a landform not unsimilar to a mesa (which can be found in Western America).",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Also, the aticle says ""there was no alien monument arter all."" if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world.

The technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were.

Why would NASA hide a big discovery of something like this to the people. If NASA found out or new there were any signs of life on Mars, I would expect there to be a newcast of that or somehting else in that matter.

Some Scientist believe that it is alien made structure, but other scientist believe it is just a land formation. It is just a land formation because, shadows are making up its nose, eyes, and mouth.

According to the article the scientists used the camera´s absolute maximum resolution so if there were objects in the picture they would see it. The rock formation resembles a human head,eyes,nose,and mouth, so we understand why people think it was a face created by aliens.

In the article they bring up reasons to believe that is is a natural rock formation instead of an alien, yet there are still people who believe that it is an alien.

In the article when the author starts talking about the Face on Mars they give many reasons as to why the Face is a natural landform. One way you know that the Face is a natural landform is because 18 years after the original picture was taken NASA went back and took newer pictures that showed that it looked as if it was just a big boulder on Mars. In the article it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.... revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that the Face was just one or a couple of years, but it went away and is now shown as a flat rock surface. Another way you know that it is a natural landform is because in the article it says that when the original NASA picture was taken they captioned it saying that it was a rock formation. In the article it says, ""NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face....A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head'."" This explains that even though the people at NASA also thought that it looked like a face they still said that it was just a rock formation that happened to look like a human face.

There are many more reason to believe that the Face is a natural landform and there are really no reasons why someone should believe that the Face is still on Mars, but we aren't getting good enough pictures. In the article it mentions a lot that the Face on Mar is just a landform and that even though people have come to believe that it was an alien they really should believe that it is a landform because there are so many more reasons to belive that.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The Viking 1 gathered the first pictures of the face ever. Many conspiracy theorists think that NASA knows that it is evidence of an ancient alien race. It still remains somewhat a mystery to people all over the internet.

The Viking one captured the first pictures of the face in history. It was searching for landing spot for it's sister ship. The mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised when it popped up on their monitors. The pictures surfaced on the internet a few days later. It was a great way to get people engaged in the attraction to Mars.

Although NASA and conspiracy theorists would be happy to discover that the face is evidence of an ancient alien race on Mars. The formation is probably just a mesa or a butte. They are both landforms common to the American West. Garvin commented'' It reminds me of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.''A lava dome that takes form of a mesa around t he same height as the one Mars.

If the face on mars was an alien artifact NASA would be famous for finding it.

Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding the fact that the face is an alien artifact,but NASA would not be hiding the fact that it is from aliens if it were because it would benefit them a bunch. For example they could make a ton of money from the publicity of it being something alien. With the money they could fund even more projects like sending rovers to Mars to try and find out more about the face, and maybe they could even be able to get humans to Mars. It would get people interested in Mars and they would want more pictures and evidence of it being an alien artifact. That is why it would not make sence for NASA to tell people on the internet that the face is an something alien instead of just being a mesa or a butte.

In conclusion there is a lot more evidence that the face is a mesa or a butte other than an alien artifact. Even though conspiracy theorists are convinced they have proof of alien lifeform. Most evidence points to it being a landform, like a mesa or a butte. There is also not any logical reason for NASA to hide the idea that it is evidence of aliens if it were true.

71CA8C7E2759,"Hello my name is Ben I am a scientist at NASA, I have been discussing the face on mars with someone who believes it was created by aliens. I have read the Article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", and I have gathered some information and in my opinion I think the face was created by natural causes and is a natural landform. Here are some of my reasons.

My first reason why i think it is a natural land form is because as stated in paragraph three of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" ""huge rock formatiom . . . which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'' By saying this they say that the face is meerly an angle with odd shadows making the illusion of a human face.

My second reason is in paragraph 5 which states ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" By saying that the conspiracy theorists are completely controdicted and the NASA supporters are agreeing with them and saying yeah it would be good if there were actuallty life on mars and making it possative on their part.

My third reason is in Paragraph 7 which states that ""Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time."" The team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. And the photos revealed a natural land form, and there was no alien monument after all. This shows that at the time the lack of high-tech cameras and technology made the landform resemble a human face. But not everyone was satisfied.

Some may argue and say ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. But NASA went back and took another look at Cydonia on a ""cloudless summer day"" with their absolute maximum resolution camera and captured an extraordinary photo. But the photo contained no alien life forms as stated in paragraph 11 ""So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion the face on mars is really just a natural landform, and stated in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West."" ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" said Garvin.

F8072F32F74A,"I would tell them that how could an alien do that if they have never seen a human. I would explain to them that its kind of hard to turn a rock into that, that is why i would think its natural. But since the rock looks like that it would attract attention to mars and it would make people want to pay and learn more about it. I would also say that thr face on mars has been in a few films,books,magazines,and radio tallk shows because when people found out about it it was a top/ very popular thing.

But things would be more truthful or realistic if there was some type of civilization,war,or history about people living there, like in the 700 B.C earlier and later than that. People that would believe in the aliens would want more info or proof. Talking to my scientist co-worker they want to keep going taking better picks so it looks better and so they see if there is any alien marks. But it is very hard for them to search and look for things like Cydonia for example. Its also very hard for them to take pictures of it when its winter because of the clouds and dust.

But in 2001 each images spans where 1.56 compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 viking photo. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,so if there where any objects on the ground like houses,shacks,planes,water,aircraft, or anything else you would of been able to see it. But in a way the aliens could of been tiring to send a messages to earth to let them know it was life there. But if they continue with the pixels, and to make bettter pixels they would be able to see even more every time.

There are a ton of things on earth that look like something but its not its just natural (it just happen). So something like that could of happened on mars, but it would be kind of strange for something to happen like that to happen on a planet where the is ''no life'. But everyone has there own opinion on what they think but we can only leave it up to the scientist to figure it out a regular person mostly likely can't only the pros. Us scientist will be able to figure it out today,tommorow,next month,or even years from now but hopefully one day we will find out. In my opinion I think we will with the technology we have and the things that will still be invented and be released one day.

So there is no way to really prove if aliens are real or fake. They are most likely fake, because they haven't tried to reach earth in any way. But if they did they would come in some type of aircraft. The aliens whole entire world would be shock and scared. No one would know what to do,because no one would even think something like that would happen in this current generation. But it could happen whenever most likely when its least expected.

But in some part of the world some, or alot of people are preparing for this are always waiting for this to happen. People should always be prepared for anything rain,sleet,snow,tornado, or anything evrything. But if the aliens never knew about life in earth, and they decided to send aircraft to like we did if they saw a rock with a alien looking thing on it they would react like we did. They would keep sending taking more pictures, however they would look at it they would get curious and try to make a trip to earth not knowing that there is actual life there.

But if earth did the same thing it would be a problem its taking a huge risk. When they would arrive and look around if they saw aliens they would panic. The aliens would be stronger then them most likely they probably wouldn't be making a trip to home. The aliens would some what react like a dinosaur if the NASA people didn't move (but they would) they would't get attack. But if they did move they would,so tiring to have NASA to go to mars is very risky for NASA and the astronauts. So they could make a better attempt by sending a drone and going around the whole planet,but the drone cant do everything that a human can. So if there is a cave or a door only a human would be able to search it the correct way, plus the drone could easily brake down or fail.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
AD083E05BDC9,"Though some may argue that the Face is alien made I belive I can prove them wrong. There have been many theories many are just based on others opinions instead of actual facts. So, how can we the scientist be right well, it's simple you use research.

Though I am on the side that the Face is just a land formation I can start to see the theorists point. In the begging yes it was some what unclear. Because theorists gave reasons to belive we couldn't see only because it was a cloudy time as said in paragraph 8. Also, it's hard to forget or just drop something as big as this which lasted 25 years. The Face was a highlight to a dull world it gave some people reason to believe that we are not alone and that event sparked so many other theories. But, never the less these theorists certinally need to get a day job and just quite while their ahead.

Now, that we have delved into the side that most don't join. I'd like to talk about why the Face should just be forgoten. When Viking 1 had been sent up in May of 2001 we along with theorists were curious about what was found. But with careful examination we were able to see it was nothng out of the ordinary. In paragraph 3 we had described it as "" as a huge rock formation with shadow that gave th illusion of a human face. In which case meant we had nothing to hide although some beg to differ. But, with some still demanding we have a closer look we had finally agreed.

In our case it was not an easy as stated in paragraph 9 '' cydonia is not easy to target."" Nevertheless we had acomplished our task and gave the people what they wanted. We had even had the technology to show everthing that could be seen on there. And of cousre NASA is stil correct becausce nothing was found just a rock that looked like a face. To compare it we had said""

its is equivalnt to a mesa or the Middle Butte in the American west.""

In conclusion, I believe that I have shown enough evidence to put theorists in their place along with others, who belive the Face is alien made. Though we and many others would have loved\benefited from it it is now proven there are no

Egyptian style pryamids , airplanes on the ground, or even small shacks. So to wrap it all up I belive and have proven that the Face on mars is nothing and should just disapear.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
EAD04227D16B,"1976 Nasa took a photo of a landfill that looked like a human face. Later on though they discovered that the face was just a martian mesa, and that the shadows helped the mesa look like a face. It is not evidence to life on mars because , Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia, And on April 5th 1998 the surveyer took another picture of the face on mars, and the image was much more clearer and they could see that it was just a landform nothing more.

Martian mesa's are very common and can be found through out Mars. The only thing that helped it look like a face was, the shadows that the mesa made. The sun also cause the mesa to look like a face but when nasa took a closer and clearer photo of the mesa they found out it was just a simple rock formation that had very dark shadows making it to look like it had a nose, eyes, and mouth as the text states.

You see al it was just a landform there was no alien sculpture or anything like that, even though that would have been cool it just didn't happen.

This is not an alien creation if it were there would be arms, legs, or maybe a body poking out of the sand and rocks. But if it is something we probably wont know for another century or a few decades. But if there is extra terrestrial life on Mars we won't know for a very long time. If aliens did create this then where are they, did they just leave Mars or get wiped out. If this was created by aliens they should still be on Mars or at least signs of them should still be there.

The face still kind of looks like a face in 2001 even though it show sand and maybe thats a little mountain. but it still oddly resembles a face. There might be other stuff like this on Mars in uninvestigated areas and maybe one or two have been made by aliens or other life. We found water on Mars so something had to have inhabitted Mars atr least once. Maybe mars was like Earth at one point in time and there was extra terrestrial life on Mars but something made them leave and made Mars just a floating sandy rock in space.

ED9BEDC624F6,"Face On Mars

Have you ever wondered if there was possibly other life forms out there, living on other planets? In 1976, NASA'S spacecraft ""Viking 1"" was circling Mars and taking photos. Suddenly, it spotted a form that almost looked like a human face. Some conspiracy theorists assume and consider it to be evidence of other life forms, while NASA knows it's just another landform on Mars. It's common to have forms like that around Cydonia, it's also proven that there is no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually show that it's a martian similar to land forms here on Earth. All the evidence NASA has brought upon us has proven that it is just another land form on Mars.

Firstly, it is common around Cydonia to have land forms as such. NASA

has taken plenty of pictures of Mars to know that it's quite common for there to be land forms like this. Although it may have unusual shadows, NASA could only wish that there would be possible evidence of ancient civilization on Mars. It being common, creates a slimmer chance of it being crafted by other life forms.

However, when Mars Global surveyor in April 5, 1998, Michael Malin was able to snap pictures with his Mars Orbiter Camera team. These pictures were much more clear. When the image was first revealed on a JPL web site, they realized it was only a natural landform. There was no alien monument to be seen. This strong evidence shows that with a clear image, there is no sign of any alien monument.

Furthermore, the pictures show that it's a Martian equal to a butte or mesa lanforms, seen around the American West. This evidence clearly shows that it's related to Earth land forms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. This Earth landform is only a lava dome. The height is similar to the height to the face on Mars. These landforms being equal, show that it's normal to have land forms such as the Face on Mars.

But, perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze, and there could be possible evidence that aliens are indeed out there. Maybe a closer look into the image would clearify these statements. However, as likely as it sounds, the pictures taken were accurate, with an advanced camera.

Nevertheless, the chances of this Face on Mars being created by aliens is proven false. NASA

may hope that someday they might discover evidence of other life forms. Until then, they have supporting explanations on why it's not. For it to be common to have land forms like the Face on Mars, gives enough clearification. As well as, there being no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually showing a land form similar to ones on Earth. We never know what the future holds, so will NASA ever discover facts that support the conclusion of there being life on other planets?    ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

One reason that the landform could be real is by pointing out that back then the cameras were not as good with quality so the camera could make it look like that. Another reason could also br the weather in that time the weather could have a big part in the way it looks.

The angel of the camera could also make a big diffrence in the look of it. the angel of the light that was ln it also could mae the changed because it was the shadow that made the landform look like a human head. Back then the pixels of the photo were 43 meters compared to now which is 1.56 meters. The clouds could also change the look.

NASA took photos of the supposibly face with a high-definition camera, that was more powerful then the one Viking 1 had. The face is just a lava dome that takes the form of a landform. If there was a airplane, hut, or a Egyptian-style pyramid we would be able to see it with no problem, and be able to make out what it is.

567BB29B602B,"If you want to believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens, that is fine, but we have evidence that it was not. The reason behind this is that like a lot of parts of Earth, it all naturally happened. Even if we find a clearer picture we have comfirmed in 2001 that it was just another natural landform And in the more clear picture, this face is the same as buttes or mesas commonly fond in the American West.

As we have been looking for more evidence we have gotten clear picture one after one, just to show that there was nothing left behind from aliens at the time. That was just the beginning. If we really have found a ancient artifact, then we would have started collecting small bits and pieces to examin them. Now, lets say that we did find that aliens created these lanndforms. We probably would have let more pictures to be seen to show proof of what we found.

Yes, there was also a thing during our winter where that everything on Mars is also hazy so that could be why we have been left to conclusion that it just naturally happened. However, if the monument gets abandoned every once in awhile then there could tools and items left back at it. If a landform was man made or in this case alien made, then there would be mistakes made, changes every once time.

As in an article that was read not that long ago, Jim Garvin says that the face on Mars looks about the same height as a Middle Butte in Snake River Idaho. This means that it was no matter what others say, it is just a natural landform that has just happened to look like a face. As from what Garvin said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

For that being so, the face is not an alien monument. The landform just has happened to be there and look like some face. Which if you still want to believe in the fact it could an alien thing that is fine. We have no alien evidence at all. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

B9A6F8B12366,"My fellow scientist thinks that there is life on Mars because of the ""human face"" that was found on Mars in 1976, but I can give him three reasons why there isn't any life on Mars and that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform. One reason is that the ""face"", based on the 2001 photo, looks a lot like landforms on Earth. My second reason is that if there was any chance that there was life on Mars NASA would keep it to themselves. My final reason is that Cydonia has many other known mesas, why would this one be special?

In 1976 and 1998 I do admit it does look a little bit like a face, but in 2001, with the better graphics, the ""face"" looks nothing like a face. In 1976 it was very popular because it made people believe in life on Mars, but with the enhanced graphics the popularity of this ""face"" went down because people started realizing that it was not a face. Also, it looks almost the exact same as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

If this ""face"" was made by aliens, NASA would more than likely keep it to themselves. If NASA were to tell this to the public saying that it was an extraterrestrial made landform, the whole entire world would freak out. They would most likely be terrified of the aliens. Another reason is since the United States' NASA found this they wouldn't want other countries to know about this, so we could be the ones to discover life on Mars beforwe the rest of the world.

In the region of Cydonia on Mars, there are a lot of other mesas and buttes. Why would this one be any different? If Martians made a mesa that looks like a face, why would they put it around other mesas. They would most likely put in a region that doesn't draw attention to keep there life a secret.

In conclusion, the ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform because it looks like landforms on Earth, Cydonia has a lot more known mesas, so this is another of its many mesas, and last but not least, NASA would never tell the world that there is extraterrestrial life on Mars.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Judging by the ways the conspiacy theorists said it might be an evidence that life exists on Mars, and saying NASA is hiding it is just wrong. The theorists still don't have enough evidence to prove it is a real life face, and that it was created by aliens. NASA actually does research, not them (using fake facts), and that NASA would never do such a thing.

In 1976, in the mission control room, the scientists founded something eerie on Mars, there was a human face on it! Many scientists said that it was just a Martian mesa, but many people still stuck to their primal thoughts instead of the scientists' well-educated minds. Scientists stated that the face was just founded out that it's just a mesa. Also, Earth have a similar structure as the ""Face"". And finally, if scientists discovered extraterrestrial life on Mars, what will prevent them from talking about the upcoming major event in scientific history. Many conspiracy theorists may state that this ""Face"" is a clear evidence that there are life on Mars. But how could there be life on Mars just judging that there is a landform that looks like a face? Therefore, this states that Mars don't hold life.

In Mars, there are many landmarks, canyon, mountains, and, of course, mesa. Life on Mars would be impossible due to harsh weather going down below freezing, and absence of liquid form of water. Then how could a creature make a monument that is two miles long without getting burned, frozen, or starve? With these harsh environment we can conclude that nothing can create this except that it got created naturally. With these reasons, we can conclude that this ""Face"" cannot get created by extraterrestrial lives.

Furthermore, Earth also have similar landforms as Mars. In the Western America, there are hundreds of butte or mesa. Mesa is a structrue that consists of elevated area with a flat top. Scientists say that the ""Face"" is just a mesa. In fact, a lava dome mesa that have similar quality with the ""Face"" that is located on Mars. Also, human brain is linked to analyzing faces. When you go to a sightseeing area, you may see some rocks that are shaped interesting, or during your way to work, you may see many non-human objects that looks like a face. So how could a structure that is present on Earth be a proof that life exists on Mars? In conclusion, Mars cannot hold life that many peoples believe.

And finally, scientist would not keep a vital discovery as a secret. Many space-related articles state that discovering life outside of Earth would be recorded as a major event in history. And if a scientist discover an alien, then he or she would be rewarded tremendously. Will anybody tries to prevent this ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" probably not. Also, scientists would be delighted for an advance in technology, they would not leave the aliens alone, they would attempt a communication to the aliens and try to learn many things about their life. Consequently, this shows that aliens don't exist in Mars.

Some may say that the ""Face"" is a clear example to show the life on Mars, and that these creatures created this landform as a sign or as an art. However, with art or sign, they would live near the structure, but there are no sign of a life around the area. Also, it is not reasonable to believe what the conspiracy theorists are stating. They do not have clear evidence, they are just following their primal thoughts like a primitive life. Clearly, it is not wise to believe the conspiracy theorists over the scientists in NASA.

All in all, this proves that life cannot survive on Mars. The ""Face"" is proven to be a mesa that is common on Mars. Also, there are similar landforms in Earth called as the lava dome mesa that have very similar properties with the ""Face.

4A8B8527DD14,"You may think that the face on mars was created by aliens and we say it isn't it's a natural landform sorta like some natural landforms on Earth like the Grand Canyon it's a natural landform but we can't actually prve the the face is a landform but we have a spacecraft named Viking 1 and 2 that has taken pictures of it so we can see if it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform.

Here is how we think that it is a natural landform, as it says in the article ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, se if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""and it also says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

Even though we think it is natural landform you guys think that aliens have made it and your point is as it says in the article ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.""

So as it says in the article ""It's not easy to target Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips we just don't pass over the face ver often.""

In conclusion even though the alien thing has a good point the pictures that Viking 1 and 2 got show that there are no alien markings and it is probably just a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or the Grand Canyon.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
67B143000AE2,"Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa. It is a natural landform just like it would be on our home planet of Earth. Although some conspiracy theorists say differently, and think that is some sort of ancient civilization building these objects.

First off, the cameras that we have today are more advanced than the ones we had. The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says that, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Another thing is that, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist from NASA's Mars Exploration Program, compared the Martian mesa to natural landforms that occur here on Earth. In paragraph 12, Garvin said, "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars."" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.

In contrast, conspiracy theorists say that there is a face on Mars and that there is ancient civilization on Mars. In paragraph 8, it says that, "" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings we hidden by haze."" Conspiracy theorists also state that NASA would rather hide the evidence that there is an ancient civilization on Mars, as it says in paragraph 5. Also stated in paragraph 5, is that the defenders of NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.                             ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5F5BFA00EFBE,"I am a scientist at NASA, and I am going to prove to you that NASA was not created by aliens, it is just a natural landform. Other scientists, including me was around Mars taking photos. We took a lot of photos and when we came back to check the photos it looked like a human face. I used a new method step by step to see if it actually was a human face, but it was not. It turned out to be a rock shaped as a head, and the rock made you have an illusion of the eyes, mouth, and nose.

To many people are concerned about aliens going to attack, but it is not true. Some scientists just want you to think there are aliens that based off what they have saw. If you look on a JPL web site you can see that it is just a natural landform. After all there was no alien monument. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms.

According to what the theory is, another reason for it being a natural landform is because NASA would rather hide and the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Half of the time on photos things start to look like ghost or even aliens for this matter if you are scared and are thinking about aliens being alive or by you. The Face is a natural landform according to the mission controllers, where the lab is. Monitors will lok like a face when you first take it but you have to clear the picture up a little bit.

For the Face to seem natural to you, you have to believe that there is no aliens out on what people call bona fide, of life on Mars. You always want to make sure that you are not just having an illusion. To make sure you are not having an illusion you are checking what ever is happening twice. For an example of a natural landform, there would have to be pictures taken and on the natural landform there would have to be a mapping spacecraft and that normally looks straight down. For an example of a alien landform, there would be UFO's with bright lights shining and would have to have a hide out for them to live and to not be seen.

This is my evidence that I gathered from the method that I used to prove to you that the Face is just a natural landform. Yes, NASA does have a Mars but, that does not mean that there would be aliens, just because it says Mars. If you ever have need some help on getting a person to believe you about something like scientists wise, come to my website JPL and message me. Their are creatures but they are not on the Face of NASA. Do not ever forget if you take a picture and you think something is there try to clear it up or get someone else to clear it up.

On April 5, 1998, Micheal Malin and his MOC took a photo that was 10 times sharper than the oringinal. That showed to prove that it is anatural landform.

A big idea is that a face has been put on Mars from another life form. It? a rediculous thought with many people such as me shaking their heads at the crazy theroy. There is no way the another life form could put this face on Mars. It? just a cool natural landform that ironicly looks like a face.

Their are many different planets with many different natural landforms on them. Mars just happens to have one of the most interesting natrual landforms however. The face as people call it, is a huge rock formation that gives us an illusion of a face. Humans have claimed that Aliens have put this massive rock formation on there, but from a scientific side their is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that Aliens are real.

Yes, the face is quite mysterious, but their are plenty of queer landforms on every planet. The media is a place that has taken ¨The Face¨ and it has made it out to seem like Aliens have made it to scare us. I can understand why one who has no sceintific background might believe this, but these landforms can occur any where on any planet over a peroid of time.

As a scientist if you belive something you try and prove it. With the discovery of the face and people skeptic of the aliens scientist? launched a spacecraft into space to see if it could find anything. Nothing. No housing systems, no monuments, no building structures of any sorts, and most importantly no life of any sorts. Mars has harsh living conditions so to find any sort of life would be crazy enough, especially aliens!

The face is just another one of those amazing natural landforms that space has given us. It amazes me and others what things can happen in space. There are for sure no Aliens in space, however. All of the evidence proves to the fact that there is nothing on Mars or in space that could build something. Who knows maybe in a million of years space could amaze us even more with another landform similar to ¨The Face¨.

A16CBD1B02FC,"Twenty five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. While snapping photos of possible landing sites, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists.

The face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars.

The land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Mailin's team an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The text also states that, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were any objects in this picure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens.

Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it ws winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" These text peices show that since it was a cloudy time, the alien markings weren't revealed which makes them believe that the face was created by aliens. However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform.

In conclusion, 25 years ago, a face had been seen on Mars by pictures from the Vinking that is a natural landform and looks similar to a human face. Some say that the landform was created by aliens, but there is proof that aliens had no part in the formation what so ever.

By looking at the images from 1976 and 1998 I can see where someone might mistake it for a humaniod face. The images are a little blurry and because of this you can see what appears to be eyes, a nose and a mouth.

Upon closer inspection of the 2001 image you can see it is just a natural landform such as a mountain that formed from the wind blowing sand over the years. NASA has done scientific research to prove to you that the Face isn't really a face, it's just a mountain that resembles one.

There have been many claims of extraterestrial life forms on Mars. Most of these claims lack evidence. There may still be life on Mars, but we have yet to gather any real evidence. I assure you that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform that shadows had an effect on to make it appear to resemble a monument.

The face had bumps on it that created shadows to make it seem like there were human features on the mesa. The 2001 picture shows this very well you can see multiple bumps and lowered areas creating shadows. Compared to the others you would still thing aliens created it.

Three pictures accurately represent the mesa for the technology used. For 1976 it looks like a face but they could only get this as the best shot for thier time. In 1998 the picture is much more clear and you are able to see exactly what it is but with some doudt because it was cloudy that day.

The technology of 1976 was much worse then what it is now. For this specific time this picture was the best they could of shot. 1998 Was much more clear but skeptics were not happy.

Skeptics influenced the public opinion. With many skeptics giving different reasons to try and defy their research the public took thier side.

To assume simply because a rock formation looks like a face that it is an alien artifact is illogical. Martian mesa's are infact very common where the Face of Mars was discovered. It just happened that one of them happened to have weird shadows that made it appear to be a face.

In 1976, the quality of the cameras that took the first photo of the Face of Mars on the Viking 1 were inadequate. On the Viking 1 photo, every pixel was 43 meters, meaning the photo would be very distorted. In 1998, it was taken again with a better, yet still not great, camera that would reveal the rock formation merely only looks like a face because of the weird shadow. In 2001, the photo was taken by a MGS with a good quality camera. The camera on this MGS had quality of 1.56 meters per pixel. Meaning if there were structures or a Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see it. This proves that the rock formation was not created by aliens.

The martian mesa is very common in the region where the Face of Mars was found, yet Garvin says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He continues by saying ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" It can be proved that this is not an alien structure as, not only is it common in that region in mars, it is also common in Western America.

There is strong evidence that proves that this 'Face of Mars' is not an alien structure, and instead simply a very common martian mesa that just happened to have shadows that made it appear to be a egyptian face. An alien structure on mars would be interesting, but I'm afraid this Face of Mars is not what it first appeared to be.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8535C94E2AB6,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" a NASA air carft Viking 1 discovered a landformation that looked like a face but scientists proved that it's a mesa. Shadows from Marses clouds or from the atmoshpere could've formed the human like shadow. Theorists are saying that there is life on mars but don't have enough evidence from the article to prove so. NASA is wishing that there was evidence that there was life forms for the sake of their budget. These are some reasons that the conspiracy theorists are wrong.

When the Viking 1 took the photo of the mesa the maritian skies could've been cloudy,or the Viking's camera could've been foggy. Scientists have ruled out the idea that the picture could've been formed by some type of life form on mars. some scientists have concluded that the are is just another mesa. Which is common around Cydonia,but only with unusal shadows to form the human face. these are the reasons that scientists have ruled the area being a mesa.

Here are some more better reasons that prove that the picture from the article is just a mesa. On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin took a better photo of the mesa and uploaded it to a JPL website. But not everyone was satisfied with just this picture, the therorists were stills skeptical about the photo since it was still a little blurry. NASA's mission controller prepared to send another spacecraft to amrs for a better higher resolution photo. These are some better reaosn that scientists have ruled out that there is possible life form on mars.

NASA's misson contoller Garvin explains better reason on why the area is just a mesa and not a alien artifact. The photo that was taken in '98 was during the martiain winter,a cloudy time of the year. The cmaera on board the spacecraft had to peer through whispy clouds. On April 8, 2001 Mailn's team captured another photo of the area on a cloudless day on mars. The camera that Mallin's team used was at it's highest resolution so the picture couldnt be clearer. Garvin say's ""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style prymaids you would be able to see it!"", Garvins reasoning for this is because during 2001 if you where looking at the photo from a computer you could zoom in three times more to get a better quality picture.

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" there have been theorists that have concluded that there is alien life form on mars,but only from a simple picture that was taken in 1976. Over the years scientists have been sneding spacecrafts to prove these theorists wrong,which they have. in 1998 sciencists sent a team under the leadership of Michael Mailn to take another photo of the mesa,once they captured the photo theorists still beleived that there was life form on mars. In 2001 NASA's misson controllers sent Mailn's team again to take another better photo during a cloud less day on mars. These are the reasons that the pictured caputed in the article is just a mesa not a alien artifact.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The face on Mars is a mysterious object Mainly because how it resembles a human face from the first picture in 1976 but that picture is outdated. One of the most recent picture taken in 2001 shows that the ""face"" is actually just a landform that appears on Earth and it is common in the American West. This landform is that appears commonly on Earth is known as a mesa. If the face on Mars was proof of an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would have better funding than it allredy has and there would be more exploration on Mars.

Although the Face on Mars has become an icon in pop culture that dosen't change the fact that it is just a mesa and at that time the camera wasn't nearly as advanced as what we have now.

The combination of cameras that werent nearly as good as the cameras that we have now and the shadows that the image had on it made it look very similar to a human face when NASA first took a picture of the mesa. More current pictures show that what looks like a human face in one picture actually is an average land formation on our own planet.

36746D9B154A,"""The Face on Mars"". Many pepole think that its more than what it is. They think that we're hiding something. That maybe what we found was something that we didn't want you to know. However, I can assure you that if their was anything going on in the solar system, that we would tell you because, well thats our job. Our job is to analyze the solar system and keep the public informed on anything that is happening outside of earth that normal citizens couldn't see for themselves. If their was life or anything else on the moon of Mars we would have seen it by now. Also, we would benefit from their being something special about the moon of Mars. Another thing believe it or not we wouldn't keep something that could change the way that we live to ourselves.

We would have seen something extrodinary by now. The picture that was taken in April of 2001 would have shown you anything else that sat nearby ""The Face"". Also in an earlier picture they determined that the mouth, nose, and eyes on ""The Face"" were shadows. They were not built into a structure the way that they would have been if indeed the structure was built by other forms of life. This also just popped up, if say someone or somethign did build it then it would have progressed. It wouldn't have just came to in one of our pictures. However, if say an asteroid had hit the planet, then it could have caused the same thing that had happened here.

On another note, anyone that knows anything about NASA knows that we get funding from the government. When we get funded from the government obviously they need people to check things out. The people that check things out are obviously going to get paid because that is their job. So if we're going to get paid more and more money to try to find life on the moon of mars then why wouldn't we want their to be life on the moon. The funding that NASA gets isn't little. Some people would have the oppertunity to make allot of money. It would also give NASA a chance to get people interested in what they do for a living.

The whole point of our jobs is to go to school to learn how to see things that happen in space beyond what we already know.

So many people think that our job is stupid and useless because all we do is stare at the stars. This would be a good way to show everyone that what we do is real. We really do see things that the rest of the world didn't know about. Most kids don't want to be an astronomer anymore they want to be doctors or lawyers. So showing them that what we do is important would be a good thing for the kids. We alll want whats good for the kids so why wouldn't we tell them?

86ECDA1AC91E,"The face on the moon is just a rock that gives an illusion to the human eye. The face had become popular and eveyone was talking about it. It appeared on Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even the haunted grocery store for 25 years.

The face is on the planet Mars and other people thought it was a face of an alien of some kind. They thought that because it looked like it had a nose,pair of eyes, and a mouth. The first picture of the face on mars was in 1976 which is called the Viking photo. The second was taken by Mars Global surveyor (MGS) form 1998. Finally, the third image was the latest image from MGS in 2001.

A few scientists believed it was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars MGS arrived at the Red Planet inseptember 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. April 5,1998 MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds Jim Garvin most of Middle Butte in the Snake River. The Face on Mars became very popular and showed on many events like the television, newspaper articles, books, and the checkout area in grocery stores for 25 years.

From what we have found, its just a landmark, you're a scientist, not a conspirasist. You are just believing what you want to beleive, and what you believe has no scientific evidence.

When the mesa looked most like a face was in 1976, that was over 20 years ago. Technolgy has advance since 1976, I mean look at what we have now compared to back then. The NEWER photos from the NEWER peice of technology, the Mars Global Surveyor, has taken better photos of the mesa. That's right: a mesa.

Even when you get disproved, you try to argue about it, now you're just arguing from a point of ignorance. Gavin said, and i quote, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the sameheight as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, there is no face on Mars, just a mesa. You are arguing from a point of ignorance because anything you can be shot down almost immedently. Technology has advanced to meaning that we can get a better look at the mesa. So just look at the facts, and stop believing everything you hear.

A79BE7C6D5F9,"We are all human beings. We all have some different opinions and some same opinions. The interesting debate was about the Face on Mars. I am here to tell you that the Face is just a natural landform.

I have reasons to why the Face is just a natural landform. First, aliens are not scientificly proven to be real. Therefore, the Face could not have been an alien artifact. Second, the face appear that a person is inside the moon trying to come out and that is impossible for someone to be inside the moon. Finally, no one could have been to Mars and created that Face because it would be stated on the Internet on who created it.

There are numberous of evidence of why the Face is just a natural landform. First, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos revealing it as a natural landoform. In addition, the camera that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo of using the camer's absolute maximum resolution. Futhermore, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compare to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Finally, the picture that Malin's team capture showed that it is Martina's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

Others say that the Face on Mars was not a Martian's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms. Some people believed that it was from an alien artiface. Others like conspiracy theorists said the evidence that NASA would rather hide.

There would have been extra evidence found in space if there was a alien seen.

The ""Face on Mars"" was described at first as a ""Egyption Pharaoh"", when really it resembled the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. If there were aliens who did make the monument, we would have not exposed this new information to the world, and have some scared, or excited about top secret information like this.

The natural landform must have been created by a shuttle landing,or has been here before we've known it. According to our team in NASA "" The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle,or mesa"", as I have said at the beginning, also if the landform were to be created by aliens there would have been some type of physical evidence that something, or someone would have/had been there before us.

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA explained "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.""

meaning, as soon as there was a shot so our supporters could make out, the picture was sent in to them. But because our supporters were not as satisfied of the picture, and thought they were gonna have some type of sy-fy picture to show them, they were sadly mistaken.

The question is is there really life on mars. The images shown from 1976 could eassily convince someone there is life on mars being that a single human has not ever been to mars before.

This dosn't necasarily mean anything though. Then they took an other picture of the so called face on mars in 1998 it came in clearer now becouse we had created new technolgy that lets us take better pictures. Then finally as techonolgy as we know it has become greater it takes better pictures now so in 2001 N.A.S.A took an other photo of the mysterios face. It turns out its not even a face it was just a land form.

So dont let hollywood get to you with there myths and spooky tales the real evidence prooves its just a land form.

It is fun though to dream of it as a sing there is other life beyond us but for right now it is just a landform on mars. If your still not conviced let me explain more the reason that we had not came across the landform as soon as we had discovered mars is becouse we don't cover that area that often but it is shurley not aliens. Look at the time capsale at the beginning of the arcticle from 1976 to 2001 it clarifies more so you can see the image better it just is a peice of land perhaps the image that was taken was just clouds casting a shadow that made it apear as a face.

The image shown in the capturing photos brought back from Mars revealed something, some call an alien, and others call a natural landform. The image seemed to have caught everyone's attention. As mentioned in the article, it has starred in Hollywood films, magazines, been heard on radio talk shows, and has appeared in books. The images seemed to have reminded people of other natural formations, looking like a natural landform.

Many things like this seem to remind people of other natural formations. Paragraph 12, from the exerpt, states ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Gavin, like many others thought this formation looked like other natural landforms.

The face is just a natural form. Paragraph seven from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" also stated ""There was no alien monument after all."" The same paragraph also included ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing... a natural landform.""

I can see why many people would think the natural formation looked much like an alien because, as included in the exerpt, it looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. However, it looked like it was a huge rock formation with a human head formed by shawdows.

I believe the Face is a natural landform because scientists believe that the face resembles landforms around the American West. One scientist said that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also, the scientist added that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.

Scientists can be wrong sometimes though. However, scientists work on their research really hard, so I believe that they know what are doing and seeing. For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa.

In the article, it states that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed that the face was just a landform, and no alien monument at all. The monument does look like aliens made it, but this fact just shows that the Face is fake and is actually is indeed a mesa.

32D988FC1AA1,"Imagine, scrolling through google just like you do everyday, and finding something you could only remember as a nightmare from your childhood. Well that may have been the case for some. In 1976, photos from NASA were leaked around the world, revealing a strange face on the face of Mars. But is that reaally what it was?

When scientists saw this formation, they to were astounished. Most just believed it was a martian messa, but few didn't. They believed there was truly acient life on Mars. Messa's were very common in Cydonia, the place they found the landform. So that was what it was expected to be, but there were still skeptics.

People from around the world believed NASA wanted to hide something. That they didn't want anyone knowing there really was life on Mars. But why would NASA want to hide something so extrordinary? Not to mention the fact they would get even more publicity and money spewing their way. But the people weren't satisfied, so NASA decided that in 1997, they would go back and capture more.

This would prove to be very difficult for NASA. The rotation of Mars would make it hard to actually land near Cydonia, but in 1998, they did it. The photograph was ten times sharper than the last from 1976. It showed that the formation, was just a formation. Not any ancient artifact. NASA took all that time to prove something that was already proven. Yet few people still were not satisfied.

The people argued that, because it was winter on Mars, it was to cloudy for the camera to take a proper photograph. They thought maybe alien markings were covered by haze. So NASA decided to set off one last time. On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second picture, this time with even better cameras. It once again, showed for sure that the landform was nothing but a messa.

One scientist, Jim Garvin, Even compared it to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, trying to help the people understand.

F89BF21BC207,"Driveless cars seem to be the next big invention people want to see. It seems like a great idea in general, but it would take a long time to get these cars approved and in a state where it would become the norm to own or use one. The money and time taken to develop these cars would be of better use elsewhere, these cars would cause unnecessary issues, and they also would endorse human laziness.

I do not think these cars should come to existence because of the time and money that they would take to develop. Even if they do use less fuel, the money that it takes to manufacture them is so great that I am sure their selling price would also be rather high, making it hard for common people to afford one. Only richer individuals would be able to afford these with ease. It just does not feel practical.

The passage also mentions issues that could arise between manufacturer and consumer. Where would the blame fall in the event that this new technology fails? Different laws and regulations would have to be created in order for these cars to be safe on the roads. Maybe the car will not know how to react to pedestrians and accidentally hits one and injures them. It would be hard to draw a line of who is to blame in those kinds of situations.

Lastly, I just do not like the idea. Because it endorses human laziness. Humans are already becoming more sedentary and technology is always being developed that makes human life ""easier"", but the tech just makes it worse. All of these devices make it so a lot of people do not eve. Have to leave their homes or do much of anything. People become obese and develop health issues, shortening the life span of humans and also putting babies at higher risks for health issues. The driverless car would be another one of these technologies that contributes to this laziness.

In conclusion, I do not believe that driverless cars should be technology that we should use in the future. Something like developing the most energy efficient car possible would be of better use. Driverless cars waste unnecessary money in development, would cause unnecessary issues, and endorse the already lazy behaviors of human beings.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F42D7D2B6B32,"Driverless cars could be one of the best inventions in the world if they worked 100% of the time and did not need any help from a human. For now though they are still a very useful invention. There are many reasons why they would and will be in the future. Some of the reasons are, reduced human errors, reduced accidents, and less fuel usage.

If driverless cars became fully automated to the point that a driver does not even have to do anything; is when human errors connected to driving will be close to eliminated. Humans may interfear with the car every so often and cause it to do something unintended, but for the most sake it would have no errors. Being able to drive without ever having crashes would be awesome. For one there would never need to be arguements about who hit who or money down the drain because of one stupid mistake. It would help people save money if they had a car that never crashed because there was no error. It could possible help the economy if people did not ever have to put money towards fixing their car after a crash. It could also reduce the amounts of death and injury from car crashes. Which would also reduce their money spent on hospital bills and inshurance. Driverless cars could be helpful in many ways, and reducing human error could help save people money and injury.

Accidents are very bad no matter how it happens. One way accidents should not happen is car crashes. If everyone followed the rules of the road, there would be no car crashes, but not everyone follows those rules. If there was driverless cars there would be no accidents, because every car would follow the rules of the road. Cars do not text and drive last time I checked. They also do not drink and drive, call and drive, or eat and drive. They do one job only, drive. We think phone calls or responding to texts is urgent no matter the time. Well, we are wrong, I would rather keep my life rather than risk it for a text or phone call, and the same goes for drinking and driving. I would rather take a cab home than risk drinking and driving, not only because it is illeagal, but because it is also dangerous. Your life is the most important thing in the world, and a driverless car can help you savor that. For no one wants to die a death that could have been avoided.

Less fuel usage in cars would be amazing. One reason is no one likes to spend extra money if they do not have to. Lower cost is something we can all agree on. Also it would reduce our usage on the oil we are using up. If the driverless cars would reduce the fuel usage it could help us savor what we have less of, because at some point it will be gone, and when it does we need a backup plan. If we could cut our fuel usage in half right now, it could give us some time to think of something else to fall back on when we get close to losing all of our resources. Driverless cars could be the first step towards that goal.

Driverless cars could have a huge impact on the world we live in today. From saving lives to saving money to saving our resources, driverless cars are expected to help the world a lot. They will be able to help people that are careless today, which could end up savning a life down the road. Driverless cars will be a new start to a new beginning.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

The reason this is a great idea is because a driverless car would make the roads much safer. There would be very little room for human error. If all cars were driverless operating under the same systm then they would always be doing the same things, meaning they would never crash into each other. With new technological advances in society, we would be able to create new sensors that could locate the objects around them and drive on the road.

726882F01741,"The idea of automated driverless cars seems like an invention from a utopian future, but it csuses many potential problems when humans are involved. The question of how to punish a robot arises with the invention of this technology, as well as what the affect on humans would be of having everything done for you by robots. Although this idea is promising and could still be used. Automative transport is quite the visionary idea despite its falacies.

The introduction of driverless cars would warrant the creation of new rules of the road, but that raises the question of whether the passenger or the robot recieves punishment. Also, how would one punish a robot for breaking the law? They are not human so any punishment would be unaffective. Also based on the imformatiom given in paragraph 7, humans might be required to remain partially in control, and if the cars are partial human controlled, how would we guarrentee that the person arrested was actually the offender? The robot could have framed the human.

Another negative side-effect of driverless cars would be that humans could become too lazy and unalert. The human is not required to be alert to the situation of the road, so humans might lose the ability of knowing how to drive. There is also an increasing dependance on machinery to do our jobs for us, and machines are known to not be as capable as a human if there is a problem. Also, if a robot malfunctions while a human is in the car, there would be the question of how the human would handle that situation.

Although, to remain positive about the idea, there are several alternatives that alleviate these potential catastrophies. The idea could still be utilized via public transport. Based on the large amount of sensors that are required for the vehicles to work, ass outlined in paragraph 3 and 4, areas that have little interference would be ideal for these automated cars. Subways run underground where there is an asbsence of human activity, this would be a perfect enviornment for automated transport to be implemented. Another place that is devoid of human interferrence is the ocean. There could be automated cruiseliners that can transport people across water, where there is a lack of traffic problems.

In conclusion, the idea for automated cars is a potentially dangerous and complex, but the idea should not be thrown out. The problems with false accusations and how to punish an automated car arise; as well as the fact that humans could become lazy and unalert in their enviornment. These problems could potentially be solved by changing the venue of where automated transportation is utilized.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
744328F7168F,"Innovation for the future. That is what is occuring right now as you read this. Driving your own car is a thing of the past with the new up and coming invention of driverless cars.

New ideas are sprouting on how to make the semi-autonomous vehicle into a fully autonomous vehicle. Wasting your time by driving will be a thing of the past. Driverless cars would be an excellent invention due to the increased safety measures that will enable safer road conditions.

Google cars are semi-autonmous and have driven more than half a million miles without a crash which shows how safe they are. This is due to the increased safety measures that ""still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This shows how the google cars are able to drive the easy, everyday road trips to work, school, or home; which is what the majority of one's car is used for. Yet, when the car encounters a circumstance that is more complicated, it will not try to navigate through the complicated circumstance, but instead alert the driver to take over. This shows how safe the car is because it is able to notice when a situation is too complicated for it to handle and then alert the driver of the impending situtation. Therefore, google cars would increase the safety of road conditions.

BMW's Dr. Huber has researched ways that will sustain the driver's awareness in an autonomous car, even though the driver is not actually driving. BMW has stated that they will bring in heads-up displays that ""can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take oversomething not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This shows how the driverless cars inventors are thinking of every aspect to these new driverless cars, not only the manufacturing aspect, but also the psychological aspects. The displays will sustain the driver's attention even while they are not actually driving, but will turn off the instant the driver needs to take over. This is much safer than what we have today because these displays are not something available to the majority of people who text and drive. Therefore, the new driverless cars will increase safety due to their innovative way of sustaining the driver's attention.

Also, the sensors in today's car have increased safety, which shows how sensors in the upcomign cars will only increase safety even more. Some vehicles have sensors and ""the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" The anti lock brake system has created safer road contions due to the fact that the sensors do the work so the driver does not have to. As the driver brakes, the information from the sensors alerts the car on how much pressure to apply and so forth, thus enabling the car to come to a quicker stop which increases the safety on roads. This shows how the driverless cars would be able to do all the work for the driver which increases the safety.

All in all, driverless cars would make the roads a safer place due to technological innovation. The many positive aspects that the driverless cars would provide would make the world a much safer place to be.

It has been a privelige for the past 60 years to get to learn how to drive. To get that responsiblity to sit behind the wheel of a car.

""In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes.""

These cars have been in the making for over 30 years and they still haven't come out with a safe and easy way to make it work. That should be a big red flag to get people to realize how unsafe these cars could be to everyone. What would happen if the car didn't brake in time and because of that it kills a group of children who's to blame there? The car becuae it can drive itself.

This would crush our economy, sure people would be buying the car-> Great for the company-> Not great for jobs. maybe you could tell those insurance companies and drivers ""Hey since we took your job and messed up your whole life lets put you in a factory where you can build more cars like the ones that ohh wait rememer those the ones that TOOK YOUR JOB"" yea happy ending right? People would get payed a lot less and if google was the only one who released it then that is called a monopaly yes you thinking like the game yea you know where you try to buy out basicaly the whole economy just for one thing and you better hope you dont land on the go to jail spot becasue if you do your SOL (well im sure you know what that means). i hope i made someone laugh not its not the best essay but you have gottent this far and i hope you laughed at least a little. ""Ohh but wait theres more for only $4.99 you could own your verry own self driving car and (wait for it) and free airfreshener"" well thats dandy lets buy one i got to get that google airfreshener it probably smells amazing. No it doesnt you know why because it doesnt exist. probably does honestly. So there are two ways you can go about this the world can get stupider and stupider with this evolution and the people in the world its like a circus not good at all but then AI would control the world ohh thats fine lets just you know give our nukes to computer and hope that it doesnt get mad at us and blow us up. see then the AI would hold the most power in the world the president would be like one atom in sometihng that has 100,000,000 atoms thats like a fly on a winsheild its powerless. You know you shouldnt kill flys on winsheilds you know why? hmm ill tell you later you just have to keep reading. this is probably a pain for you to read. But this is very well what could happen in not my lifetime nor yours becasue your obviosuly older than me whoever is grading this paper. Im guessing about a few generations that self driving cars will be the norm maybe my lifetime probably not thought hmm I dont know.

Ohh yes that was just my introduction are you read for the next two paragraphs that you have to read. Well first guess what this one is also wabout self driving cars but it is about there saftey (with more jokes). Why does the car cross the road??? ... To get to the other side I know pretty good I came up with that one myself. Ohh wait they die thats what happends when you kill flys on the winsheild the fly dies after it cries and tries to synthisize. you know as a human you can control that, but as a car that is opperated by an AI it wouldnt know if you kiled the fly or not it could just turn on the wippers and gone that fly is. Also the person is at risk if the car messes up and your not paying attention then waht happens you could get hurt really badly and whoes fault is it then how do you prove in court that the car crashed not you or what if the car wanted to crash becasue it didnt like you and you treated it poorly. Also whay happens if you are speeding and then the cop pulls you over and says sir do you know how fast you were going and you so no my car was driving itself sorry sir. Then is it your fault or the cars.

In the end it all boils down to a few things you know after it evaporates. you have you and your car and its your choice in the end.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4EC13202EA24,"As the years go on and we grow what also grows is the advancement of technology. Since the new era of technology has taken place the possibilites have become endless. Years back they didnt even have electric window control it was all done with a handle that you had to turn and turn until your window opened. Looking back on that compared to this day and age we have cars that are so close to driving themselves is that the safest idea no, but in my mind i think its a great idea to make self driving cars because everything technology wise is growing rapidly so we cant just leave cars old and boring we need to keep up with the technology we have at this time in our lives and make something new and awarding.

So we all know how many safety concerns we face in cars when on the road and this is exactely why people believe we shouldnt have self driving cars. Therefore i believe self driving cars are getting a bad rep without even getting a chance. if you dont test an idea you will never know if it would have worked or not and with the technology we have today i believe that in the near future sometime soon we will have a full self driving car. I understand that it will be hard to do and i agree that it can be very unsafe and so thats where the trial and error part comes in you have to try new things to know fior sure if they will work and i can say now that in the near future if we do end up having self driving cars that everyone who uise to say dont try it its not safe will themselves be buying self driving cars.

In conclusion, i know that the speculation with self driving cars is odd but the real truth of the matter is that thats our future. Every few years new inventions come by surprise and shock the world and this is just another thing that i can confidently say will come soon and take the world by surprise. Will there still be people trying to get rid of this invention? of course people will try but thats the key to sucess having people say things about what you have made and making it something so big that those same people will be shocked that ever thought something bad of you. So time is not slowing down for anyone its going fast and so soon hopefully by 2020 as seen in the article companies can start to announce self driving cars and change the way we look at cars now.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

the car companies are trying to have the people in the cars always have their hands on the wheel but people would end up taking advantage of their new found freedom in the car and it could turn into bad horrible disasters the cars are able to drive and what not but they cant navagate through difficult things the cars are also supposed to have heads up displays but i find that, that could prove to be a terrible decision in the endbecause if people get to comfortable they may end up sleeping at the wheel not tpaying attention or just being dumb.

so thats why i think we shouldnt have driverless cars becuase i dont think that everyone would use the cars as safely as the manufactorers wanted them to be used.

There is a new car coming out that can assit you on driving. But would you really want to take that chance.

Here are simply a few ways why I would apose this idea. The chance of getting destracted while having something to assit you on the car. The other reason why

I would oppose this idea again is because the liabilitity of the acciendent. And the last reason would be just too many distractions all around and risk everything around when you can just drive normally. Also known as being lazy.

First, the thing on with this driverless thing is crazy. They are so many things that can get in your ways and mess you up. All it takes is a couple of seconds to end up in a wreck. and all of that can be avoid by just simiply driver yourself around.

Second, with all that drama with the driverless thing. There would a lot of complaining about it. And say if someone got an injury by one of these driverless cars that google has came out with. Whose fault would it be the driver or the manufacture that made the car. Who will ever known because people would lie to save themselves and also get a lawsuit on the people who made the car. and tha would save a lot of time and money if they would have just stuck to the regular car.

Last but not least the people who make the car will have a ton of lawsuits on their desks. To save all this time they should just keep the cars the same and work on preventing those cars even safer before they decide on doing something else. this is what i would call pure lazieness. In my opinoin we should not what to take the chance of injurying someone.

In conclusion, they are unlimited reasons why we should not have these driverless cars. So suport this answer and we will save money and have a safer enviroment.

6A8D21EBA6DB,"With technology advancing you can drive your own car like how you see them in the movies. Technology is advancing to the point of driverless cars and they will be seen more in the near future. Though severl might think that having driverless cars can be dangerous, the technolgy advancing will make it to where you might not have to buy a car in the future. Driverless will be safe to drive on the roads even without a driver.

Sensors on the car can keep you from danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. Sensors are nothing new, but with the technology advancing since the 1980s automakers can make a car that allows far better responce and control than a human driver. With futher improvments on computer hardware and sensors, automakers can design car that can handle more driving tasks on their own.

The anitlock brake and driver assticance system has made its own way on helping the full invention of driverless cars. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.

BMW has already annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.

Several may argue that a driverless car is not safe. A variety of car companies have and are developing safety devices to assure the safety of everyone. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety while deveopling the future.

Safety is the number one key to the adevances of driverless cars. From sensors, antilock brake and driver assistance systems, and development for the advanced technology; automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety. That is why they are developing the technology further to insure that consumers are safe while they have made technological advances. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
3BEFA845FC27,"There are people all around the world that makes different varity of cars but theres nothing like driverless cars. Driverless cars are negitive, in my opinion. They'll keeps you secure, make sure your observing the road at all times, and the seats even vibrate when the vehicle is in danger but drivers must be alert and ready if the car is in any type of situation. Thes variaty of cars can be useful for those who have trouble keeping their eyes on the road. There are multiple reasons why driverless cars are useful but could be also negitive vehicles to us. Just keep reading to find out why.

All the driverless cars sounds so good and cool to us but most people would buy them because of what they and what they could do for them. Even though these cars came watch out for us and have vibrating seats and designed to do work and things like that but what if the car colaps? Anything can break and some things cant be fixed. Just imagine youre driving this new car and boom! it stops. You might think you need gas or oil change but really, everything broke down. Nothing is working the way you bought it. Youre going to need a new car.

These type of cars arent even good for a first time driver. If the car is doing everything for them then they're not gong to learn anything. Driverless brake by themselve, thats one important thing a first time driver needs to know. If theres only cars like this in the world with no regular cars, then i honestly think all of our cars are not going to make it.

Accidents inside the car can also be a problem. Lets say we have children and they get to the front seat with juice in their hand with no lid. Juice is going to get everywhere and there's going to be a big mess. Juice gets into the sterio or or where to start the car up at theres no more driverless car anymore.

9AC1364B5A09,"Having to not worry about not staying alert constantly or saving up for a new car over a life time are a just a few benefits we could potentially recieve with the development of driverless cars. I feel that scientists and developers should continue the development of driverless cars because with this new technology the rate at which an accident occurs could potentially be decreased, the amount fuel used to operate a car would be cut in half, and if you ever decided to operate manually, the vehicle could apply its advanced accident safety systems before an accident has the oppurtunity to take place.

One reason why the development of driverless cars should be continued is because they can prevent accidents from occuring. Being built with the new technology allows these vehicles to stop when needed, slow down when entering harsh conditions, or alert the driver when an accident could potentially occur. These types of safety features could prevent head on collisons, hydroplaning on roads, and accidental traffic violations.

Another reason why the development of driverless cars should be continued is because they can cut the amount of fuel needed to power a vehicle by half. This is important because in today's modern day scientists have discovered that the amount of fossils fuels fuels in the world is decreasing exponentially. At that rate, they say that within the next five hundred years there will be no more fuel left. With the development of these types of vehicles, scientists have the ability to cut the amount of fuel needed in half, which could increae the number of years to one thousand.

The last reason for why the development of cars should be continued is because they can provide anticipated accident safety features. What I mean by this is that before a collision takes place, the advanced sensors constructed inside the car are able to detect an accident and provide an earlier response. This could mean that they will deploy airbags earlier or even apply substantial pressure to the brakes hundreds of feet away from opposing harm.

To say that driverless cars would be benficial is an understatement because they have the ability to change the world. Their new features could end the number of accidents involved with vehicles. The amount of gas that will be used could be saved and manipulated for other life changing technology. Lastly, they could prevent, us, drivers from suffering from severe injury in a collision.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F079BD9C0C31,"I think it would be cool to have a driverless car. I would say that even in a driverless car, the driver should still be able to take control when needed. I think we should keep it to where the driver could take control whenever, because of road construction. I would say that a driverless car, with also control of a driver would be fine.

I would say it's fine because, Google has drove driverless cars under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than hald a million miles without a crash. I think they are saying it is safe. Also, the Google cars aren't actually driverless because, they are alerted when to do something. These alerts are for example, when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, as in roadwork or accidents.

I think it would be cool to have one when you need to answer an emergency call. It will be safe to answer the call, because if you need to take control it will alert you. If someone was injured, I would say it would be the manufacturers fault. I would say it's the manufacturers fault, because they are the ones who made it, they were in control of making the car the whole time.

I would say a driverless car would be safe, in only some conditions. These conditions would be, when the car alerts the driver when they need to step in and drive. Another condition would be where the car would know where the road construction sites are, and would take the clear path to get to the destination of where the driver wants to go.

03259FDA2D4E,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are coming"" the author presents both posititve and negative apects of driverless cars. In my opoinion I am against the development of these cars. I think that this cars are not safe, and would be to expensive.

Firstly, the driverless cars in my opinion are not safe. I think this because technology can always go wrong no matter how much time or money is spent on it. You just never know when it can go wrong. For example, in the article it is stated that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safest car has human driver control at all times. So it is insane that people are trying to develop a driveless car when by the law it is proven to not be safe. Another example is in the article it states that if technology fails and someone is injured who would the fault lie on. So this shows that with driverless cars technology will fail at any time, and can cause accident on innocent people who in the first pplace where never in support of driverless cars.

Secondly, the driverless cars should not be developed because they are to expensive not only for individual people but for the country. For example, in the article it states that the smartroad sytems work surprisingly well, but that they require a massive upgrades to exsisting roads, that was simply to expensive to be practical. Driverless cars would require the upgrade of not only a part of Indianas road but the whole U.S. and the world. Which is a tremendous amount of money that would be needed to upgrade all the roads. Driverless cars do not only need upgrades in road to be safer and work better, but the car itself needs alot of expensive technology to operate correctly and safely. For example, a driverless car needs spinning sensor on the roof, dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form constant updating 3-D model os the car's surroundings, and so much more is needed for the driverless car to mimic the skills of a human at the wheel.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not and will not be any much safer then a human at the wheel, and the cars are to expensive and would be a waste of money for the country. Driverless cars will fail at some point because tehcnolgy fails, so why risk the life of innocent people. The cars are to expensive, so why waste so much money on driverless car.

DE0275A222C1,"What is my position on a driverless car? I believe with enough improvments and optimization it could be a great substitute for real drivers and offers some great advantages with some disadvantages as well. As they currently are however I don't believe they can be substituted fully instead of a real driver. However with enough improvment and bug fixes they certainly could be.

Why couldn't they be used fully now? They aren't really as reliable as they need to be so they can't be used instead of real person. Driverless cars don't seem to have the ability to deal with unknown stimulus such as an accident on the road, therfore it is ill equip to make an apropriate decision to avoid these situations. And it appears the they can't handle speeds that you would find on the highway. Driverless cars aren't perfect but they do have some advantages along with the disadvantages.

First of all they have bulit in GBS so they wouldn't get completely lost like a human can. If there tech is advance enough they could avoid danger more effectively since a computer can react faster than human. There would be a decrease in mortality rate on the road because there wouldn't be as much danger paying attention somewhere else like being on you phone since you aren't the one driving. The amount of money you'd spend on gas would decrease since it would always drive the most cost saving speed.( while staying in bounds of the speed limit of course) You could be more productive with your days since you would be spending less time driving the car.

But currently they aren't advanced enough to take over driving fully from a person. The GBS tachnology that we currently have is faulty and will often make mistakes. The Cars sensors could malfunction causing it to speed up or slow down to rapidly causing a accident. They Currently can't make the apropriate decisons to avoid a accident or navigate around a roadblock. Also it can't really go speeds that you would find on a highway safely.

Now here are some of my suggestions to where they could get to the point where they are useable. There would need to be a large amount of servers set up to help the cars to make all the correct calculations. The censors on the cars would need a serious improvement so that they would be able to take acquire the correct data from the envronment. They would also need a better built in computers to process and interpret all the data. All of this development would increase the number of available jobs around the world helping out the economy. The driverless car isn't a reality but with enough effort it sure could be. Of course i'm no expert so take these suggestions at face value.

So in conclusion no they shouldn't currently be developed. They have a lot of problems that need to be addressed before hand. However in a few years they certainly could be. Technology needs to catch up with the concept because it currently isn't as reliable as they need to be. People also need to change they're perspective on them if they are going to go anywhere.

Without drivers that would put so many people out of a job.

My first reason is because they are dangerous. Anything can go wrong and end up killing innocent people. Technology has malfunctions everyday and sometimes we dont know why. No person or people should loose their lives because people are too lazy to drive their own vehicals.

My next reason is because they cost too much. Here in Richmond, Indiana we are barley affording to pay for schooling and teachers let alone driverless cars. Driverless cars should be the least of our worries at the moment. Instead of focusing on driverless cars, we should focus on how to lower the cost of an education.

In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both sides of the argument. After reading the article, I have come to conclusion that Driverless cars are a positive change in technology and can be used for the better.

Google has already invented the driverless car and has been making improvements for years. The car contains sensors on the wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted on the rear view mirror, a GPS reciever, and an intertial motion sensor. All of these things are used in the car to ensure you are provided with a safe ride. Because of Google and their invention of the Driverless car, in the future this could be the public transportation system. These care would use half the fuel that taxis use today and a driverless car offers far more flexibility than a bus. Paragraph 5 states, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"" This quote is showing that all the sensors and cameras that they have inserted into the car make it safe to ride in and make it so that the car is mimicking how it would drive with a person behind the wheel.

In conclusion, The google driverless car is an invention that could change the future and they way that we get places. There are both positives and negatives found while testing these cars and making improvements. Overall, with all of the sensors put in the car to ensure safety, google can make it possible to have a safe ride in the car.

The last reason I am for it is they will allow pedestrians to use public transpertation with out there life in risk.

How will a driverless car let you relax at the wheel. A driverless car will let you relax at the wheel during traffic jams up to speeds of 25 mph. The only thing you would have to do during a traffic jam is keep your hands on the wheel. The car will make you keep your hands on the wheel by using sensors. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

Would anybody have ever thought there would be cars that dang near can drive their selves with out hurting anybody. Well the car designers are getting close. There are sensors on on some of these cars that will allow the car to brake instantly if the car is out of controll skids or roll overs. When these cars come out it will allow them to brake before running off the road. Without the option of smarter roads maufactures turned to smarter cars that can steer them selves.

World transportation with out worrying about the driver wrecking. There would not be no worrying if there were driverless cars. The google cofounder forsees these public transpertations using have the fuel that we use tody on cars. he beleives such cars would fundamentally change the world.

Driverless cars are made to know that something bad is going to happen on the road before you do. They are designed to alert you when they see something you cannot.

So what that means is that, while your changing the radio station or looking for something in your backseat, the car will automatically alert you if anything unsafe is on the road.

These cars are pretty amazing if you ask me. But don't get me wrong, they aren't flawless. Technology is something that we learn more about everyday. So the more we know about technology, the more we know how to fix anything wrong that has happened. Especially in cars. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
8175C177E8BB,"Driverless cars are the next big thing to come into our world. Driverless cars would be such a help to everyone around the world. With all the traffic out there you get tired of stoping and going, then hitting the gas then the brake. Well now you dont have to do any of that with driverless cars. They'll do it on their own, all you have to do is steer at times. So, with having driverless cars they will do less harm to the enviroment, safer for your freinds and family, and it's easier on you.

First, the driverless cars are less harm to the enviromen. Just think of all the taxis out there in the big cities wasting all the gas that we put into them. It harms the enviroment way too much. With these special driving cars it's a proved fact that they use half of the fuel today's taxis use. That means it's not polluting the land as much and the oxygen will be cleaner and fresher as well. With all of the pollution going on our ozone layer is decreasing rapidly and ith the makings of these cars it wont harm the ozone layer as much now, and as a matter of fact it will help it.

Moving on, the driverless cars are all in all safer than modern day cars we drive everyday to world and back. At night when you cant see very well and your in the back country it can see up ahead way farther than you ever can. Here's a situation for you, say your driving along in a regular and a deer runs out of the field and SMACK! Now your calling a tow truck in the middle of night and your kids are scared. Now if you had the safe driverless car it could of hit the brakes because it saw the deer run out of the field, and now your driving home safe and your kids are safe. Don't worry about steering, the special car is made to do it. You can just sit back and relax and enjoy the ride to wherever you are going.

Lastly, you always want things to be easier on you right? Well now we have a solution for you. Instead of hitting the gas then the brake in the big cities, have the car do that for you. So you don't get fustrated of hitting the brake and gas you can just chill. This specialy made car can ultimately bring you a stress free life.

Now you can see that having a driverless car can bring you a better life. With all of the values it has you will never regret gettting one. If you're at the car lot and have to decide wether driverless and have to drive. I can count on you'll make the right choice. So, making it less harmful to the enviroment, making it safer for your travels, and finaly making it easier on yourself, driverless cars are the way to go. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

It can do all the work for you as it says in the article ""they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves."" Which is really awesome but what if something happens and all that ends in something bad.

What if the car starts to have a malfunction and loses control. Who knows who would also be responible for the inccedent, like the author says ""who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" The driver may have to pay for the damge if they were to be responsible for the problem and that wouldnt be any fun or cheap. Also in the article it asks if it would be boring waiting your turn? So true though wouldnt it be boring just sitting there waiting your turn to drive? Aslo what if drivers are to busy on their phones and a deer pops right out and the car doesn't stop on its own. To put the car together manufacturers had to put so many sensors on the driveless cars isnt that a little to much? Last but not least theses cars can't drive through situations like traffic issues or navigate through roadwork. I do not think these cars are worth it.

How I feel about driveless cars is a no go. I don't think they should be sold to anyone. These people just never know what could go wrong with them. Very great idea just probably should stay an idea. They would need so much done to them to ever truly be safe for the people. It would take them many years to get to where they went them to be.

C1A9DD47D555,"Driverless cars are obviously cars without drivers. Many have envisioned such an idea as revolutionary like Sergey Brin. As a matter of fact google has bulit such cars since 2009. However some people see this as a flawed idea and see this as a bad thing. I'm honestly split about each side.

Driverless cars do have a lot of positives. They are ecologicly friendly, so they save both gas and money. Also, they are way more flexible than a bus could be, since it can go anywhere. Not to mention they are way more safer than normal vehicles, alerting people who are distracted by anything while on the road. Speaking of safety, that seems to be a marjor area that is adressed. For instance, when there is a problem the car would state it and giver the passenger the option to take over. Another way is the cars expensive sensors that detect when there's going to be a problem, and automaticly breaks the car to avoid any damage.

However, there is some glaring issues that must be adressed. First off people will get bored beccause they are passengers. Plus being alarmed of this everytime your dozing off, by the car itself, isn't going to help anyone, just annoy them. On top of this driving cars is a rite of passage into adulthood. Taking that freedom away is just wrong. Not to mention, whos to blaim in an accident involving two of these things from different companies. It's stated in the paragraph that new laws must be made for these kinds of cases, and that could take years.

DF8AC0A24514,"As we enter a world where humans want to depend on technology for everything, even the simplest of tasks, the idea of ""driverless cars"" is introduced. What sounds like a great idea now, doesn't have as much potential when looked in to. While these ""driverless cars"" are envisioned to use ""half the fuel of today's taxis"" and ""offer more flexibilty than a bus"", there are still some aspects that don't make the cars completely ""driverless"". Before driverless cars make their huge impact on the world, some of the ""minor"" details need to be further developed.

How often do you hear of people calling for transportation services, such as taxis or Ubers, because they aren't in a state of mind and being good enough to be able to operate a motorized vehicle? If taxi systems were to be replaced with driverless cars, who would drive those people home? A major flaw in the driverless cars is that they might require human assistance sometime throughout the trip. If there were to be a spontaneous accident, or large work zone ahead while the only human in the car was intoxicated, that would pose a lot of danger for that driver and every other driver around. The safety of other drivers on the road has to be taken into consideration.

Making cars driverless means no one would be completely in control of the vehicle. Keeping that in mind, in the case of an accident, who would be to blame? The driver could be at fault, but then how really driver-independent are these cars? With the possibility that the car will more than likely need human assistance, the driver themselves is only slightly benefited.

Just because ""driverless cars"" are assumed as completely ""driverless"", an actual human capable of thinking and doing for the car is indeed necessary. Where I'm sure there are certain groups of people that will benefit from being able to get from point A to point B without having to think anything of it, there's still that larger population that will find almost no practicality in watching their vehicle drive itself when they are capable of doing it themselves. Aside from the safety features that comes with a car having a mind of its own almost, I think we're better off without this technological advancement.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
4361077BC9D9,"Which is better to have in the future a driverless car or a driver car? Well I think that a driverless car is better for the future than a driver car. There are multiple reasons as to why I believe this ,such as the fact that a diverless car is more flexable with public transportation than a driver car like a bus. Although a driver car has its perks like being able to park and re-route through traffic and accidents. However does a driverless car have pros and cons?

Yes a diverless car has it's pros and cons like if the Dubbed LIDAR (roof senser) went out than the car would not be able to mimic the skill of a human driver. Some of the pros to being in a driverless car are it can detect danger before the driver and has multiple safety proticals to make sure that anyone in the car won't get hurt. Driveless cars also have the ablity to speed up to 25mph in a traffic jam, although in a way a driverless car still depends on a human driver for alertness.

So would it be good to build cars like these for the future? I say yes. I would support making a driverless car because it can really help people in life. It also makes driving much safer and easier. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

One reason why driverless cars is a good idea is that this will make driving safe. Reckless driving happens all the time everyday.

It's not that far fetched that soon we could also have self-driving cars as well. Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but they first should be tested so no hazardous glitches remain.

Recently there have been multiple breakthroughs that have advanced progress on making an actual self-driving car. One such advances was the more advanced sensors that are now put on cars. Now, these sensor help alert drivers to where a possibly dangerous situation is, but in the future they could be used as the ""eyes"" for the car. No car would be able to drive on it's own without being able to sense which direction it's going. As well there have been multiple breakthroughs with computer systems, which would give the car the know-how in order to drive on it's own. Lastly, thanks to satellite imaging, almost the entire world has been mapped out. This, added along with everything else, could really help realize the future of the self-driving car.

Now even though this idea sounds fantastic, it's not without flaws. Sometimes computers will suffer errors in their programming. Most of the time, this isn't too important, but if it happened to a self-driving car with someone in it, the results could be disasterous. The cars would need to be heavily tested to get rid of as many of these errors as possible. As well, there would also have to be a new set of laws that pretain to self-driving cars.

AFE9B6AA1365,"I am against the development of these cars. The reasons i am against it is because for one, why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver ? like they mentioned in paragraph 8.

I feel like thats doing to much , if your going to invent a ""driverless car"" make it so that it can do everything by its self without the owners help, so that way the human can relax while the car does all the work.

For two, if the owner has to still do work and take over at certain times and certain parts whats the point?, you might as well just get a car you can control fully (a normal car) not a car that controls half the stuff you could be controling while you still have to conrtol certain parts/things.

What about new beginners that are just now learning how to drive ?, they need to know how to work/control the whole car NOT certain parts, what if they end up banning these ""driverless cars"" because its to many accidents and new beginners only know how to control certain parts because they were so used to the ""driverless cars"" that controlled most of the things in the car they arent used to the normal cars.

I honestly feel like they should just stick with normal cars and let the owners do all the work.

The owners are the ones paying for the car so why not let them control the car i could see if they werent making payments and stuff on the car and all they had to do was pay for it and its all theirs but their still going to have to make payments so why not let them control it themselves ?. What about if there is an accident the car shouldnt have to warn them anything, if the owner was paying attention to the road like your supposed to you would know if its an accident or if its about to be an accident. if someone is hurt who would be at fault the driver or manufacturer? i feel like it would be the manufacturer fault because their the ones that make these ""driverless cars"" thats supposed to do mostly everything and thats supposed to warn the driver when something bad happens.

What if the car makes a mistake and dont warn the driver ? , they should make it safe and confortable if thats the case because their the ones making these cars not the owner. It would honestly only be the drivers fault if they were the ones controling the whole car and all the parts because if they werent paying attention to the road and they controlled the car and an accident occurs then its 100% the drivers fault for not paying attention to the road like todays car , they wouldnt sue the manufacturer they really wouldnt even do anything because its the owners fault.

733A8B1972E5,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" I think driverless cars is a bad idea. It could harm people inside the car if anything goes wrong. If anything does go wrong with the car and if it hurts someone or even kill someone, manufactures will be blamed for the accident. The people wouldnt be able to trust the company anymore and the company will start to lose money beacuse people would stop buying their cars.

Developing these types of cars sound very cool, but the safety of these self-driven cars is a big concern. No one would want to take the risk of any problems with the car that could lead to their death. In paragarph 9 in the article it says "" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" the manufacturer should be responible if anything goes wrong. They should be responsible because they made the car and after one injury they should just stop the company of making more because they will continue to hurt people will their product. Somethign could go wrong with the car without alerting the driver and it could go out of control without anyway to stop the car.

Human drivers should have 100% control of their car, because if anything goes wrong it will be against the driver not the car. people trust them selfs better than the car. Some cars cant even handle driving their selfs on their own in some tasks and what if it doesnt alert the driver to take over, this could seriously lead to big accident.

If an accident does happen everything will be blamed against the company. The company will have charges agaisnt them. The company will be force to shut down before another accident can occur. The cars will be seen unsafe to drive, this will give a reason to the people not to buy these types of cars. If people stop buying self-driven cars the company will go bankrupt and everything will go to waste.

If new technology is taking over like cars, no one will know how to fix the car without help of the manufacters who knows what is going on. people wouldnt want to be charged just for them to check on the car and to know whats going on.

As I have already stated in the previous paragraph that I can invision this future, but I also support this future. The era of perfectly calculating autonomous cars would be an era of complete safety on roads. The driverless cars not being subjected to human errors would not make the foolish mistakes that a human might make in situations like slick roads, alcoholic influence, and peer preasure.

With only minimum tolerance for errors in todays technology I do not see the likelyhood of an accident due to the fualt of the car.

I am not a fan of this idea and feel that there are more negative aspects to the concept than positive. Based on the amount of fatal car accidents every year, data shows cars are already dangerous enough. Revoking a persons control of their car entirely will only make the problem worse.

Cars driving themselves sounds like a great idea, but in reality it is not. There have been an abundance of occasions where machines malfunction and cause serious or even fatal injuries. In fact, less than 20% of commercial plane crashes are caused by human error, meaning more than 80% the crash was caused by a problem at the manufacturer! Those number are scary to think about and this is on a much smaller scale than cars. Those numbers show that machines are not as reliable as humans. To give the machine complete control of your life is very scary, not only that it would be extremely dangerous.

As I stated earlier in the prompt cars are a necessity in this day and age, meaning that knowing how to drive is just as important.

Driverless cars are dangerous becasue you never know when something will go awry. Computers aren't always working and I would never want to put someone's life in the hands of something that is not reliable. For example somtimes I turn on my computer at home and it doesn't work the way it should be working. What would happen if that was in charge of your car?

These laws have been in place for a very long time and nothing too awful has happened, this law helps to keep people safe. I don't know anyone who would put their lives in the hands of a computer.

Another reason for driverless cars not to be developed is because they are too expensive. They would cost so much money to create and to fix and to have roads that adapt to the cars. Car companies would be spending even mroe than now to get these parts for cars that don't need to be made.

Creating driverless cars in the world seems like a big deal today. In all reality, having driverless cars around the world can be an accident just waiting to happen. If you really think about it, teenagers would most likely be the main ones buying driverless cars. Drinking while driving, texting, and falling asleep may accur when entering a driverless car. Is creating a car that drives on it's own really worth costing a life?

Drinking when driving is a huge mistake people tend to make. Giving them a car that works on its own, and allows you to sit there and get more drunk is not a very bright idea. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If you are drunk and the car alerts you to take control you may not even respond.

Texting and driving happens with anyone and everyone. People are way too focused on seeing what their friend sent them instead of paying attetion to the road. Alot of collisions have happend because of one driver texting and driving. "" Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters they need a whole lot of sensors."" Say those sensors just happend to suddenly cut off and not give any warning. How will a person know when to look up from their addictive phone?

Working hard days 24/7 can make a person extreamly sleepy. Say you get off of work and your exhausted, and a peaceful song comes on the radio.

F340A53BBC32,"Are driverless cars a good or bad thing? In my opinion driverless cars can be a bad thing. These next few paragraphs will explain why I think this and all the cons of the cars.

If driverless cars ever do become a pratical thing one big problem we would have to worry about is the GPS or the LIDAR malfunctioning and the car doesn't know whats going on around it. If something like that did happen and the person in the car was not paying attention the car could seriosly indjure some one or it could total itself. A lot of these cars features rely on the fact that if something goes wrong then person behind the wheel is ready to take over but if some thing does go wrong and the the person is sleeping they could swerve into a semi-truck or a building. One of the biggest problems of this car is the fact that tech can stop working and cause accidents.

Another con of these cars is the fact that they could get hacked by other people. Recently in 2015 two people (with permission) hacked a car that was not even driverless they could control speed,steering,door lockes,brakes,and so on. Imagine what could happen if criminals hacked into these cars they could potentialy kill lots of people by making the cars crash into buildings,cars,and other things. Another problem is human error.

What if something does go wrong and the person is not ready to take over? I have touched on this a bit already but I'm going into a little more detail. Much like normal cars the driver has to be awake behind the wheel ,in the case of driverless cars, just in case they need to take over the wheel of the car. If someone is on a long drive and decide to let the car drive itself but as they are sleeping the cars malfunctions and the driver does not know they need to take over the car and the person could end up in in a ditch or end up crashing into another car or even worse a semi-truck.

Are driverless cars a bad thing? In my opinion yes they can be after reading the artical and looking at the facts i conclude that these cars could be a hazerd on the road.           ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A7B069D3B600,"Hi my names Kaigen and I am against the idea of self driving vehicles. I honestly think it would cause more mayham. Just think about it, what if a deer runs out in front of your car. I know you are probably thinking they have some fool proof plan to avoid these incidents, but take out that word deer and replace it with a child. Yeah that changes things up a little huh. No matter how fool proof they claim their ""self driving"" cars are it a bad idea. Things happen, technology fails. Its a part of life.

The story even says 'the driver has to take control entering or leaving a driveway', or ""if theres road work it needs the driver to take over"". This is not ok. What happens when you are going through an intersection and the light turns red? Is the car going to speed up, or stop in the middle of the road. What if you are going through a school zone? Hows the car going to know any different? They also said in the article ""for this to work it would be espensive"". In my opinion the last thing we need is to go even further in debt. Yes I can see good in this idea, but i beleive the bad over rules the good in this instinse. Just imagine what would happen if a car pulled out in front of you, sure these machines will probably have a pretty good reaction time. But it can not be anywhere close to the reaction time of a frightened parent. Child saftey is the number one thing car manufactures need to be worried about. If they get the ""okay"" and come out with these i would want to see these flaws adressed before anyone puts a child in the vehicle. I am not saying its a bad idea, heck I even seee a time in the future where a car is driving me around. I just dont think they have everything figured out yet and i dont think they will have anytime soon. Its reasonable for these to come out on the market, they just need to meet all of the saftey regulations. I also beleive that if they are going to do the track cars, where they run on tracks like a train, that they would have to rip up every highway, every back road, and evey interstate. This would take a ridiculous amount of time and money. We are talking billions and billions of dollars and possible two or three decades. I am kaigen, and this is why I'm against a vehicle that can ""drive itself"". Plain and simple they are not safe and would cost far too much to make safe and reasonable.

D195E4354F21,"Who would have thought that our world would be where it is today in the automobile feild. We started out with simple horses and buggies, and now we're sporting driverless cars. The future is here, and i'm super thrilled to be a part of the generation of technology.

Apparently, Google has developed a car that literally drives itself! Who wants to worry about puting the car in drive, and wondering if you're driving alright...you'll always be driving great! The google cars ""have driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" which absolutely amazes me. Safety is a very important issue that I personally worry about often, but with this out of this world invention, I wouldn't ever have to worry about crashing, to an extent. Also, since these cars are basically crash proof, you'll always have a designated driver if you're unable to succesfully drive yourself home.

You always hear about crazy people driving recklessly under the influence, and taking thier lives, taking others lives, and harming themselves and the well-being of innocent bistanders. With this breakthrough car, drunk driving rates would hit rock bottom. People wouldn't have to put others, and themselves in any sort of danger, because you're not the one driving, your car is. Again, safety really plays a gigantic role in these vehicles. These wonder machines also have sensors, so that if for some reason traffic is too much to handle for the smart car, the car will send a vibration through your seat to alert you to take over.

To me, that's the only problem...the cars aren't fully in control. Evidence from the article states, "" Google modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" Seems like alot of sensors! I would really love to nap at the wheel, but it seems as though I would be unable to proceed in doing that. So that is something I would definetely encourage manufacures to establish...no sensors, just pure driverless cars.

These cars are nothing short of amazing, and I can't wait to own one for myself one day. They are safer than your typical car, and also super cool and intereesting. So if you want more safety, and more reliablity, definelty go with the Google cars.        ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

A459492C73CE,"There are both positive and negative aspects of driveless cars. There are reasons on why driveless cars should be on the road. But, there are also reasons on why they should not be on the road. One reason why they should be on the road is because they would use half the fuel of today's taxi. One reason on why they shouldn't be on the road is because they still need a human in the smart car, and that might cause wrecks due to the driver if he/she is not paying attention.

One reason why the smart cars should be on the road is that they are better on fuel. Google cofounder Sergey Brin says that he envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driveless cars form a public-transport taxi system. He also says that the cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009.

One reason on why they should not allow driveless cars on the road is the possibility to wreck. The driver still has to remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. Which sometimes it might not quick enough or the driver might not have enough time to react, which will possibly cause a wreck.

Another reason why they shouldn't allow smart cars is because they will cause more wrecks. Since they can steer, accelertate, and brake themselves, they might not brake in time when they get close to another vehicle. But, they notify the driver when the road requires human skills. They notify the driver when the driver needs to navigate through work zones and around accidents. And, they are better on fuel.

They shouldn't let the driverless cars on the road due to the possibilies of a wreck. Also, they might not give the driver enough time to react. Then, the smart cars require a driver in the vehicle anyways, and they need full attention inside the vehicle. Another reason on why they should ban the vehicles is because the quick change from vehicle to driver would be very quick.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
96FFE19CBFB8,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. As driverless cars are becoming a new deveoping technology, it's best to ask yourself, ""Are driverless cars really a necessity?"" The answer is, no, they are not a necessity for many reasons. We should not continue to develope driverless cars mainly because; driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside of the car, and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this?

When you hear the words, ""driverless car"" what comes to mind? Perhaps, you think of a car that can take you anywhere, and young teens the age of thirteen not needing an adult to drive them to a desired destination. However, driverless cars are not 100% driverless. In the article, the cars are said to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, because of this an alert driver is said to still be required. People are still needed to be able to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers are still working on creating new ways to alert the driver when human skills are needed, but it is no secret that this will continue to cost money.

Another reason why we should not have driverless cars, is because to have them, companies think a built-in entertainment system should be created, installed and required inside of all driverless vehicals. Today, we already have vehicals that contain a television inside for the passengers who occupy the back seats, to help keeped them entertained. This new entertainment system is said to shut off when the car needs the driver to take over and will not be available to a driver who is texting or using their phone in any way. However, putting in an entertainment system would still be considered a distraction, just the same as if someone were to be using their phone, and the article states drivers will need to remain alert, but they can not remain alert with an entertainment system.

Finally, we should not have driverless cars because, if an accident were to occure, or if something fails, who is to bame for this issue? There are situations where we would not know who to blame, the driver or the manufacturer. We could blame the driver, stating that they should have been paying attention and been alert to stop the accident before it occured. However, we could also blame the car's manufacturer, because they were supposed to build the car and make sure it was not able to fail in the first place.

As you can see, driverless cars could bring more trouble to us than we realize. They are not a necessity, we do not need to use driverless cars as our dominant way of transportation. The article states many positives and negatives aspects of the development of driverless cars. However, we should not continue to develope these cars because; driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside the car, and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

The teenagers may get bored of just sitting there and not drive, but the older people wont because they could relax. It could be useful either way, maybe some teens would like it because they enjured something, they wouldn't be able to drive now but they could if we had driverless cars. In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they said something about putting something in the car to entertain them and making sure they keep their heads up at all times. Just because there is driverless cars coming soon doesn't mean that people can just drive them around whenever they feel like it, its same as being a car when you have control. You still have to watch out and go the speed limit, you can't take it and sleep when it's driving.

Over the past years cars have developed a lot. Now there are cars that you can turn on while you're still in the house, some cars have wifi, you can turn the heat on, and open doors before you get to the car. People want what is new so they can show something off but they don't show off the problems they could have with the car. Now they are making this new thing where a car can drive you around itself without you having to take control? Have they thought about the car accidents that could happen? Or how it could injure someone? This will take more responsibility than what a driver has now.

Would there have to be any test taking for those who want their permit or license? How do you know if they are capable of being in control over those things? Having the cars we have now are good enough. Those who want a driverless cars should still capable of doing the things they do now with a regular car. Senors will still be in the cars, if adding them to the new cars that would make it better for the person and the car.

They want to know who would be responsible for an accident? Well it would be the persons fault. If they aren't looking at the road because they were distracted by something else than that could be bad. They should be able to take control when they see something bad is about to happen.

Now if the driverless cars come with speaking instructions that could make things better because you can tell it what to do. If there is traffic and your vechile is going to fast you should be able to tell it to slow down.

Whether they're or no driverless cars people should always be safe while driving. They should always have their eyes on the road and be able to look to their right and left to make sure it is clear to move over.

C6DDF1883511,"My position on driverless cars is that im against the developing of these car because of what they bring. Things like this would probably cause chaos. More than likely to have accidents and whos fault would it be. Some situations with these driverless cars can also be crutial. Im against it because the laws, what wil happen after a accident, and how these things would actually work.

If the law focuses on how safety works and keeping everyone in the car safe, what if theres a malfunction and theres a accident ? Then who will get the blame for it ? The way it will work is if a human driver is in control right, but then the driverless car looses control or has a breakdown who will be affected ? The developer or the ones in the driverless car. The traffic laws are for someone to be in control of the car so therefore it is safe. Maybe a change in laws can solve this problem and conflict that may possibly happen.

Accidents happen daily, so will the driverless decrease the chances of that happening ? In my opinion is that technology goes wrong here and there not always but it happens. If these cars arent deveoped the proper way where theres accidents daily, who gets the blame. I personally think that the developer and the one who had the idea to make this should take a part in it. Why ? Simply because if you took the time to make something so cool and fun, it should also reach state safety laws. When accidents happen and if its the drivers fault they get blamed for it right ? So if this driverless car where there is no driver who get the blame for a injury, the driver or manufacturer.

How will this driverless car even work or be developed. The car is gonna have a sensor input system to take over when in traffic. Sensors arent really the best thing to have because something can cause it to stpo it from working then what happens there. If you still need to be in the driver seat and paying attention to the road what is the purpose of this developement ? It has its own brakes but you can take turns, but cant you do that in a normal car just takes alittle bit more time. This driverless car isnt a bright idea just because of the way it works and the problems it can cause.

Im against it because the laws, accidents and what can possibly happen, and the way this technology might take place. States are gonna have to change safety laws which in some the car needs to be proven to be safe. The accidents and the way things will be faced and who will be blamed is gonna be insane in most peoples opinion. The way technology might take place is also gonna be a factor because it can go wrong if not built right. Therefore im not so convinced about the developing on this driverless car.

I thnk this because they wouldnt be driving the car the car would be driving itself and that would make people pay less attention. But dont get me wrong it would be a nice and amazing idea if we could all be responsible enough and pay attention so that we dont cause accidents. These cars would also help us from accidents because it would be smart enough to know when there is a stop sign or anything like that.

Some things that could ruin this idea would be if you thought about what if they mal-function and the car crashes and seriously hurts someone. Im sure that the cars saftey system as in air bags and other things would become one of the prime resources if it did mal-function. I feel as if more people would trust this car if there was a percent or something on how efficent this car would be.

Some other major problems would be the price range i mean lets be serious no one wants to spend alot of money on a car that isnt worth it. I think if the car was a little cheaper and was alot more reliable on being able to pull over and stop without human work. the part that is good about the car telling the driver to help is it would keep the drivers alot more on the road then they would be if it could stop and pull over all on its own.

They've created a car that can steer, break and accelerate on it's own therfore, virtually calling it driverless but, the assistance of a human is still very much needed. In order to make the idea more fun and appealing they've placed entertainment technologies into the cars, which can be very useful at times, but the most important and useful thing about these new cars is their saftey.

Thousands of people all around the world get into automobile accidents everyday. But what if over half, if not more, of all those accidents could be avoided? When it comes to driving, safety is the most important thing there is. With the new driverless cars, that's no longer a big problem. With it's abbility to sense and see everything arround you, it's able to break or accelerate if needed and they have warnings that they give you to help keep you from hurting yourself or inncocent pedestrians and when it's your turn at the wheel it signals you to do so with a special feature, some cars' different than others.

Although it's not completely driverless yet, they're slowly progressing towards that bright future.

This input combination is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of human beings at the wheel. What do you think about driverless cars?

Most driving laws focus on trying to keep people safe in or out of the car, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. The negative side i am trying to get at is that if these cars are made and the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault: the driver or the manufacturer? What this is trying to prove is that if there is an accident no one would know who to blame because there is a driver, he's just not in control of the car because it is driverless.

The Article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨ allows us to believe that maybe thery´re not a thing of the future, but actually a right now present day modification to our way of living.. Now is this a good thing regarding the safety of the common people, I believe so. Does it help or economy, lets discuss and see.

First off the article points out that google has been doing thier test runs since 2009. ¨Their cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.¨ No one has been killed in these test runs, and how many have been killed in regular driving since 2009, the number is sad. Driving these cars arent as dangerous as people make them out to be. I would also like ot point out that these cars may be able to dive themselve's, but Google cars arent entirely driverless. They're unable to back out , and navigate through roadworks and accident, so they allert the driver in those situations. The car knows when its unsafe for it to be the one in control of driving so, its going to alert you to take over and get through this. Some of the ways engineers have allowed this is with vibrating seats, and flashing lights in the car. Some have even suggested getting a camera installed inside the car, that way the car knows if your paying attention while you are driving. Next these cars are not made so people can daze off, and text on their phones, or just not do anything in the car. Special sensors in the sterring wheel allow the car to know if you have your hands on the wheel. The cars are designed so that the driver must stay alert while drivig, and ready to jump in when roads require human skills. With all of these necessary precautions in store, and the history of how well Google has managed so far, it´s very safe for the right driver to be behind the wheel of one of these cars.

Its the best option we have economically wise, of changing the world, and advancing the world. Smart roads were investigated, in the 1950's general motors created a consept car that could run on a special test track embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever at the front end of a car. Again Berkley tried the same thing using magnets and alternating polarity. The smart roads worked very well, but the cost of upgrading all of our roads to fit the criteria was to much of a hit to the economy, the smartest choice was to modify cars so that they could become smart enough to be dirverless. To be safe the cars have a lot of sensors installed into them. The most important sensor having to be LIDAR on the roof of the car. This sensor shootss out a laser beam to form a constantly 3-D model of the cars surroundings. To help the economy its safer to update the cars with these, then to fully update the road systems we have now.

Driverless cars are not a thing of the future, ther're a present day modification to our way of living. They're not anymore dangerous then driving a normal car, and may even be a bit safer. Also they're the best choice econoimcally that our country can provide, to improve our way of living and advance us that much further. So why not get with the new era and drive a driverless car.

I think that there is not a safe way for a car to drive a person all by itself. If you don't know the next action that your car is going to take, how can you stop anything bad from happening? Will the car be able to determine where to stop if it is approaching a stop sign? There are too many ""what ifs"" with a driverless car for me to feel safe to ride in one, or to even have one driving on the street around me.

To me, there are a variety of things that can go wrong when you are allowing the car drive all by itself. There are too many questions that need to be answerd about these new cars. For example, how will the car react to a sudden change in the environment? If another car gets to close will it swerve out of the way potentionally causing an accident? Even if the car notifies the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, what will happen if the driver isn't notified in time? Also, if one of the sensors on the car were to be broken or damaged, then how could the car continue to drive on its own? Would it notify the driver that a new part is needed? If the car were to get into an accident, who would be to blame, the driver or the company that created the car? Would it depend if it was on manual control or automatic? These questions are the main reasons why the driverless cars need to be improved before I will even think about ridding in one. I know that I would rather know exactly what I am doing and how it will be done instead of having a car try to do it for me.

I think that driverless cars are a terrible idea. There are too many problems that can occur during the driving process, and I don't want my life in the hands of a car that can't see or think the way that a human does. If during some parts of the drive it requires a human to take the wheel, why have it automatically drive you? Wouldn't it get tiring waiting for your turn to drive, especially when you aren't sure when the car is going to have you take over? You must stay focused on the road and have both hands on the wheel, so you could very easliy just drive the car yourself without the worry. This way you can control the situations that you get into, and not having a car get you into trouble that you might not be able to get out of. I think that it is much more safe to have a human that can respond quickly to change and can manuver through obsticals than to have a car, that might not see everything in its environment, drive automatically through it.

I know a lot of people that like to drive being on their phone or something. When they do that, they start to run off the street or onto the other lane. You don't want to panic when that happens.

While the industry of driveless cars is expanding slowly but greatly it is yet to be a fully drawn out plan. The driverless cars of today are only somewhat diverless. Meaning they can stop themselvs or drive short distances but still in certain situations the drivers hand is still greatly needed to avoid harm to not only padestrians but to the ""hands free"" driver as well. Honestly if your hands are needed for certain situations why not just drive fully? If the driver is behind the wheele of a hands free car they will be tempted to do other things with there hands not paying attention to the road at all and we have enough of that with people in self driven cars. That also means that in a situation needing a humans touch would be nothing more than a sudden alarm or vibration going off and needing your reflexes to save either a padestrian or your own life like a quick time event in a videogame. The huge difference is if something goes wrong there are no second chances.

Another issue that could be of concern is as much as technalogy is well loved and how most devote their lives to it, it isn't perfect there are mis haps and incidents that tech causes everyday but though the driveless car idea seems like a good one the tech behind it could not be reliable causing possibly a number of problems. If accidents and shut downs things of that nature are to happen who is at fault the owner who signed the contract to own such car. Or the manufacturer who's faulty equipment could've caused the issue in the first place?

In conclusion the idea of a totally driveless car is ideal. It might even be a necesity for some but until the project is fully finnished and has proven itself to be a great, safe, and dependable form of transportation we should be warry of how fast we say here take my money. One day the Driveless car could become a huge industry all on its own shaping itself into the next big thing but for now, lets stick to driving ourselvs around in the mean time.

FE9E14F641F8,"Automakers are progressing closer and closer to bringing fantasy and reality together by creating the driverless car. Many people debate whether they should be legal, or if they even have any real use to the world. The driverless car is not a practical option for the world to turn to.

To allow technology to completely overrun our lives and to go on ""auto-pilot"" for the rest of one's life, would do much more harm than good. The driverless car will allow drivers to essentially ignore the road and their surroundings during their trip. Though the manufacturers may warn consumers to be alert during their ride, one must find it pointless to pay for an automatic car, when they may have a normal car that requires a slightly higher level of attention. One must fear that for going on ""auto-pilot"" for so long, the people may forget how to drive properly.

When these cars get in an accident, there will be a law suit between the driver and the manufacturer. If the car gets in an accident caused by the car itself, then the manufacturer will have ""wrecked"" it's reputation, and hopefully will be forced to recall every autonomous car of that model, which would be extremely expensive fpr the company to do. To add to that, these cars will be far too expensive for consumers to be worth all of the legal and insurance hassle that would be attached to it.

Finally, one should find that the automatic car would disconnect their emotional connection to their normal car. Tthe automatic car takes the fun out of driving, making the task seem to be a mundane way to get from point A to point B. The automatic car would steal one's confidence in having control over where their going, which also means drivers would do less ""taking the long way home"" and more ""get me to where I'm going"".

In conclusion, the automatic car is not going to become the future of driving. In American society, people have emotional relationships with their cars, and the automatic car would not fill in that gap. For the people that would go for the automatic car would become unaware of their surroundings, and frankly would be set on auto-pilot for so long, that one fears that they may forget how to drive properly. In the end, the automatic car may be good to some, but inpractical and inflexibole to many, but no one knows what the future may hold",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E60CBA7670DE,"Can you imagine a world with free personal transportation? A world where there's not a need to own a car,becsuse the public tansporation is free and reliable. Public transportation such as the city bus is a common mode of travel within the city,but replacing independent driving with automatic cars is a controversial subject.

In my opinion,driverless cars are a wonderful invention. As it is commonly known,there is a ridiculous amount of c02 polluting out air. I think that lower amounts cars out driving would improve the air quality and the health of wildlife in the area. Drivers may become bored more easily when driving because they are not focusing on driving but in my opinion even this is a positive factor. I say that its a positive factor, because people tend to get distracted while driving which could cause crashes. Car wrecks are completely avoidable,and I think should make changes in technology to prevent occurences like that.

All in all,I think that self driven cars are a positive innovation. I hope to see them on the road soon.   ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E4F518EFCAEE,"Im for driverless car , becasue i believe that it would make driving alot more safe for people and would let people know whats happening before it happens. it saves money too. the reason i say ir saves money is becasue it would be better on fuel . ""use half he fuel of todays taxis."" it would be both more safe for the driver and the other person becasue it alerts the driver when something is about to happen or if it needs human skills to move through an area.

They started creating and thinking about driverless cars late 1950's , the first concpet car was made by general motors , the car ran on a special test track that allowed the car to follow it . another company tried a similare thing , but it worked with magnets in the road. so instead of the techonolgy begin in the car it was in the road , the system worked well , but it would be to expensive to replace all the current roads with this new one . It wouldnt be praticial for anybody.

Now the concpets of driverless cars arent that far away because of all the techonoly we have now in the world. Google modifeid the Toyota prius . They use sensors on the left wheel to position it , it has a rotatiing sensors on the roof, video camrea mounted on the rear , it has four automotive radar sensors , and a intertial sensor. All the techonoly i just named off helps the car be aware of its surrondings. the rotating sensor on the roof makes a 3-D model of the cars surrondings to keeps track whats going on. the driverless car mimics the skills of a humam at the wheel. The driversless cars are not fully without need of human skill, in diffcult or dangerous sistutation the car will alret the driver to take hold of the wheel and move through it . The car stills requires the human to remain alret the whole time while in the car .

The only problem with dreverless cars is that most law makers do not know if it is more safe with driverless cars or with humans drivers. Law makers know that the safety is best when they have alret drivers. Since lawmakers think that driverless cars are illegal in most states , expect for California , Nevada,Flordia , and the District of Columbia. Those states though hae limityed use of semi-autonoues cars. Most manufactures believe that more states will follow with the others one once they assure them that they ae reiably safe. Another thing is needed once the say its legal, they would have to make new laws just incase someone does get into an accdient. who would be liable for the acceident , the car or the human behind the streeing wheel.

The facts and states i put above in the beggignig and middle paragraps are the reason i believe driverless cars would be more safe. They have the techonolgy to keep us alert and safe at all times. They adjust their selfs to the apporiate sisutatuion . They would safe gas and more then likely save lifes in the long run , because of the techonolgy they have in them to keep us safe and out of danger. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A55924343C9D,"Driverless cars would be a helpful tool in the future. They could help us get things done while heading somewhere far away. It could get rid of driver errors. Drunk driving could even by stop by this new product. This is why the driverless car should be allowd.

First off the time you use to drive all the way down to Florida is about 12-18 hours. Lets say someone is going there for their job that 12-18 hours could be used for all sorts of things like making up for you job while your away or just finshing a project you did for this meet. It would be a great way to use your time instead of having to drive. This could be an amazing break through for somepeople who have to travel many times for their job.

Secondly, if we have only driverless cars all driving they would know how to react to each other. This inturn would get rid of driver error such as drivers getting angry at each other. Another example would be cars speeding past each other, which cause recks. Driverless cars could bring down the death toll from car crashs every year by getting rid of driver error.

Finally, a big problem today is drunk driving. If we had driverless cars the drunk drivers would never have to touch the wheel making the roads safer. The car its self could never get drug or slow down its reaction speed making it safer than with someone above .08. This could also bring down the death toll, for drunk driving crashs every year.

These are all reasons i believe that we could be better of with driverless cars. It may cost more and their might be problems at first but in the long run it could save many of lives. Many states do not trust it, but i believe after they make they cars smarter they will see that they can driver better than any human ever could. Saving lives for many people which if worth it.

48F2F2876E3D,"In this article about ""Driverless Cars"" i feel it could be a problem having cars on the roads that isnt operated by an actual person. There could end up being a problem with the driverless cars if they arent ready but the developers dont know if a problem has occurred til its out on the roads. I would think that the developers would wait for awhile just to make sure that nothing major could happen with the car whenever it is out on the roads and hopefully wont cause damage. Some people might be fascinated with cars that could drive themselves but it could be dangerous because without a human operating the vehicle it could crash and damage our community.

Some positive reasons for having driverless cars is that it would be easier and better for people to have them. In movies, they have driverless cars which people think are really cool. If they have driverless cars in the future and something goes wrong, they have sensors so that the driver knows if there is a problem and they have drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, which is a great thing to have, especially if you almost back into an object or another car. Using a driverless car could also be a new way to actually make driving a vehicle fun.

If the driveless car developers wait for another 10 to 20 years on having them on the road, it would be better and much safer because the more time they spend working on them the better it will be and the less problems and damage there will be.

Also, before 2000 we didnt have the mapping, sensors or computers but now that we do we should spend more time try to fix the issues that they have. If you use mapping on a driverless car, it might not work as well as you might think because what would you do if it gets the address wrong and ends up taking you to the wrong place. GPS's arent always the best to use because they might have to relocate all the time which could mess everything up.    ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
EEEA70D157C7,"I think it will be a bad idea because, the auto mechanuics will lose alot of there jobs because they would have to go back to college in order to know how to fix these new cars. And I think is just pure laziness because we dont want to drive. Yeah it might be easier in some ways but also harder we will have to learn alot more new things. You can also get seriosly injured I mean yeah you could still do that in a regular car but you will at least be in control and it would be on your part. But if its not you driving the car the dealership or the manifracture will be the one to get in trouble because there system is the one driving the car. What if the car decides to turn and go fast into a ditch you can do nothing about it and you would just have to set thier and watch it happen. I know people are busy but you can atleast take time out of your day to drive somewhere yourself.

Alot of laws will have to be changed as well because their really wouldnt be any reason to take a drivers test because the cars already know what to do. What would the age limit be? How will the car know the aspeed limit will there have to be new road put in so the car can detect it? See i just think there would be to much conflict and we should just have to drive the cars our self.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
B4B605F897BC,"Driverless cars could be the way of the future or end up being the worst invention humans have ever fabricated. Driverless cars is a very good idea that could change the world for good. Even though there are some dangers, with research and time, these dangers could be eliminated for good. The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the environment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past.

The environment will benefit greatly from driverless cars. For example, ""The cars forsees will use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.""

Also Modern cars have much better fuel economy and lower emissions than older, driver reliant vehicles. Crash rates will go down so there will be less debris on the road. Human error is also something that will become a thing of the past.

With time and research, cars can easily become smarter than a human. Humans lose attention on the roads, develope road rage, and brake the law frequently. These are all things that could lead to a fatal crash. For example, ""Further improvments in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" Drunk driving will also become a thing of the past and save more lives than anyone could even imagine. A driver less car can also utilize some of the cars capabilities that a human can not access. ""The information from the sensors can cause the car ti apply brakes on individual and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the envirnment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past. Technology is advanced enough where we can develope safe and effective ways of getting rid of human error. Driverless cars are a great example of human innovation becomeing a reality.

28C500CF125C,"People talk about how driverless cars are going to help the future, and its going to keep reckless drivers from being in control. Now, if you think in some aspects technology today still has not ever ran right, so why try make something so advanced if we can't even get the little things down first.

The world now in days has come to a point where technology is doing everything for us, as we come to a point where we rely on our Phones and computers to do everything for us. Dont get me wrong, technology does have its advantages, it can show us things that we never were taught how to do and help us with our history, it does help with alot of things but is it not kinda sad that we rely on it now.

I believe in some aspects that a car so advanced could decrease wrecks and reckless drivers, but if people now and days would straighten up and be the safe driver that they need to be then we wouldnt have to make a car so advanced to drive for us. Everyone is relying on their electronics to do everything for us now, but dont you think its kinda pety that we need technology to do things that we can literally do ourselves. They say in the passage that the smart car is going to need the passenger to take over on somethings, but is it not kinda scary knowing someday that technology isnt going to need our help and its going tobe doing everything for us.

B552732A859A,"I find that driverless cars is not only a bad idea but a bad advocate, I also find that this car is a bad avocate for not only teenagers but adults as well. Although the car does seem cool because it is something new doesn't mean it won't malfunction while being used at anytime. People would have to take extra procausion while using this type of car. I could see more accidents in the future rather than safe driving.

The main reason I find that driverless cars is a bad idea is because of drunk driving. Teens and adults already take full advantage of it so why wouldn't this car advocate more drunk driving? Not only on top of cars malfunctioning, you have to pay extra procausion, and plus on top of all that someone decides to drink and drive. People don't understand all of the responsiblities you have to take on while having a driverless car.

As to many teens they like to show off, a lot. That is something everyone likes to do, but imagine all the horrific things that driverless cars could cause. It only takes one person to get distracted by their cellphone or other passangers in the car. Something could happen to the car in just a short period of time, The car could malfunction but the driver responsible wouldn't know or they didn't have enough time to stop the car or give their attention to the road.

In my opinion I believe that driverless cars should be banned from every state. Driving isn't just about getting to your destiniation, but keeping drivers, passenger, and pedestrians safe. Only alert drivers would be in the proper state to drive one of these cars but teens and other drivers that aren't very alert and are already not safe drivers and could cause many problems.

4A5FD95B6D72,"I do not think that there should be driverless cars. Driverless cars still need a driver in them. They also can drive around or know if a road is getting fixed. The cars could also be dangerous. These are reason why i think we should no have driverless cars.

First reason why we should have driverless cars, is because they cars still need to have a driver in them. The car should not be conicered driverless if they still need a driver to take over just in case of an accident ahead. The cars also do not have eyes can not see, how will it work at night. Also during the winter the driverless cars would have a lot of accidents because of snow and ice.

Second reason, is the cars would not know when there is a dead end or the roads are getting fixed. These cars could run off the road if a bridge was not complete. The computer hardware could go down in the middle of driving and people could died. These cars are not humans, and could kill lots of people because of simple mistakes.

My final reason is these cars can be dangerous because how would they know when children are running through the streets. These cars would not be safe around children or eldery people. In the article its says ""If the technology fails and someone was injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufactuer?"". How will the law handle situtations like these, who would be at fault they would not know.

I do not think they should be driverless cars for many reasons. There are also, some good reason why we could have them. A couple reason are they dont use as much gas, they do thing that humans can not do, but these cars can be dangerous to the community. i think that there should not be driverless cars, and cars should say how they are.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E2681EA8C42A,"Automated vehicles are nice and all, but when it comes donw to it, ahuman should be responsible for his or her own actions on the road. The use of automated automotives just seems to be a liitle too risky to use on roads within the next few years. Automated automobiles might sound like a good idea in theory, but technology fails all of the time and I would not be surprised whatsoever if lawsuits sprung up in the near future, due to accidents caused by so-called ""smart"" cars. There are currently no laws regarding smart cars, smart cars are unreliable, and smart cars would not offer the same experience as a normal vehicle would.

One would assume that driverless cars are 100% safe. That is a very false statement, as drivers may still take control of the wheel. Who is to say that a driver would not just grab the wheel, drive off of the side of the road, and attempt to sue a car manufacturer for a faulty product? There are little to no laws regarding self-automated vehicles in most states. New sets of laws and other rules would have to be put in place in order to maintain peace between civilians and car manufacturers. Paragraph #9 states that new laws would have to be made in order to assure liability to a specific party if one got in a crash due to the smart cars. It seems highly impractical, and it also seems like a waste of precious time and money.

Smart cars may sound very safe and enjoyable in theory, but all technology has the capability to fail at any given moment. Imagine a world where driverless cars are simply rolling along down the streets, and perhaps one combusts here, or another veers off of the road there. Paragraph #7 talks about how some cars are only partially automated, and that is honestly the best way to handle the situation. A driver should still be responsible and should be able to make his/her own decisions on what to do on the road. There are dangers in this as well, because some people are not bright enough to use and understand the technology to its full advantage, and could cause problems in the process of maintaining the vehicle. If a vehicle has multiple sensors scattered around its body, those sensors can be tampered with and can malifunction; whether it be intentional, or a simple mistake, accidents do occur on the road.

There is no experience in the world like driving a car. Kids look forward to it their whole lives! Girls will get cars on their 16th or 17th birthday and SURPRISE! YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY GET TO DRIVE IT! A computer will do it for you! To me, that does not sound appealing or very fun in the slightest sense. Imagine sitting at the sterring wheel and dozing off, due to the fact that you have not had to touch the sterring wheel in miles. Dozing off at the wheel could be a fatal experience. Making drivers operate a vehicle is much safer than allowing a computer to do so, because it should be the choice of the driver as to what happens on the road. In paragraph #8, a psychologist states that automated vehicles could cause drivers at the wheel to get bored. Boredom leads to weariness, which will eventually lead to sleep, which in turn could result in a fatal accident to the driver, a passenger, or pedestrians/cyclist. If someone did not want to drive or take responibilty for it, they could have someone else drive, they could ride a train, or fly in an airplane! It just seems so unrealistic and kind of ridiculous that someone would actually want to be driven by a machine. If a person owns a car, they should be responsible for managing it and whatever occurs on the open road.

There is no practical use for smart cars in a modern day society. Perhaps in the future, when technology is more advanced and when the people of the world are even more brain dead than they currently are, we could have smart cars driving people freely throughout the streets. Smart cars will never live up to the security and safety measures of vehicles operated by a human driver. Smart cars are a lot more trouble than they seem to be worth. Smart cars would require new laws, maintenace and regular repair (so a malifunction may not occur), and trust in a machine that could fail at any given moment.

Driverless cars would be detrimental to our society. Cars without dirvers would not be safe and would lead to more accidents. Without an actual thinking human behind the wheel, anything could go worong. There could be a system malfunction that could result in the deaths of many people. Driverless cars would also not be as mentally healthy as driving a real car is. Driverless cars would not be mentally stimulating at all. Sure, the car may be able to provide entertainment for the driver, but that is nothing compared to the mental benefit of driving. Driving requires you to think about your actions, whereas simply being entertained does not. Not driving your own car would also lead to more laziness. If humans stop having the energy to just drive their own car, then what comes next? We stop walking and breathing on our own too? Driverless cars would just push us closer to doing nothing for ourselves and relying on technology completely.

Driverless cars are something that our society needs to avoid. They would cause many more injuries and accidents than our current cars do. They would not be mentally healthy.

FAE077D9355F,"Personally i am for driverless cars because with these cars if a accident were to ever occur the car would prevent it from happening which would prevent lots of deaths from texting and driveing from hit an runs. It would also keep the driver protected and also other drivers on the road protected. And also the sensors on the car modify when you are to close to a object or are going to hit a object before it is going to happen. And also the dubbed LIDAR use laser beams to form a constant updateing 3-D model of the car's surroundings with this combination the input is necessary for the driverless to mimic the real skill of a human at the wheel. And with the assistance and help of google the GPS his able to connect to google maps to navigate the driverless car to it's destination. With the sensors on and in the car drivers assistance isnt a problem, with the antilock brakes the is willing to stop when something is blocking it or is comeing at it with a equal speed. With more roadside assistance from google you can connect your cell phone to the car and answer the phone as you please and still be able to safely drive on the road.

With some of the assistance there is another added one its called ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but the special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of wheel. But not any of the cars made today so far has not accomplished makeing cars competely driverless they can break themselves, steer and also accelerate and all this tecnology keeps driver notified when on the road.

The car cant do all this on its on it needs human skill and assistance at the wheel along with it. Such as steering and working its way through work zones and getting its way around accidents. But the human at the wheel must be paying attiention and alert to whats ahead of him or her. And when a situation occurs it must require human assistance.

The human does not have complete control on stopping the vehacle. GM has a special development , when ever the vehicle is in danger or is backing up into a object the seat vibrates. and when the vehicle cant manage somthing the human can it announces the human should take over and it sends other ways and signals the driver another way if not seen that way. there is also another way to keep the driver focused on the road and to make sure there are cameras watching the driver to make sure the drivers remain focuesed on the road, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.

automakers and manufactuers have devolped a new and fun way to make driver pay attiention to the road and to keep the driver safe they will continue makeing these changes to the automoblies today and in many more years to come. they have predicted that in 2020 cars be able to drive on autopilot 90 percent of the time. but only time willl tell and get us closer to inovate more technology each decade.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

And what happens when other people found out what happened to the car the broke down and caused an accident? Because I doubt they are going to want to keep driving that driverless car.

C2DB3C695BCF,"My argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them. These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.

First of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.

Second, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.

Last, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.

The driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.

8F587DDC5E0D,"Driverless cars are a bad idea for a couple of reasons. People may begin to become naive while driving, start being a victim in more wrecks, and be in danger of losing safety. Do we really want to put people's lives in danger just so we don't have to drive and can be lazy?

The first reason is that people may become naive and try to sleep while driving because they will believe you do not have to drive at all. This is wrong because in the passage it states that you do have to drive whenever the car needs human help and can not complete a certain action such as driving through roadwork zone or accidents. The name of the car is a false advertisement if you don't read into it.

Another reason is if a person gets in a wreck while in this car would it be considerd the person's fault or the manufacturers? If the person is not driving then it would be the manufacturers for a malfunction in the car. This will put these manufacturers at a place where they will have to pay for damage and insurance to whoever was wrecked into and fix the problem. If this happens to more than one person people may not buy the car or from the company of the car anymore. As stated in the passage there are no rules currently about these driveless cars and there would have to be a new set of rules that would need to be made. Many states are forbidding them completeley and you can't even test drive computer driven cars.

My last reason is that these cars are not completely safe. In paragraph eight it states that drivers may get bored waiting on their turn to drive. This could result in people falling asleep and playing on their phones when they should, at all times, keep their eyes on the road. Anything could happen at any time and it could be unexpected. The cars do not seem incredibly safe for anybody to drive.

I would not reccomend this car for anybody. However if you are older and wiser and know what you are doing this could be the car for you. You will just need to be so much more aware of your surroundings and make sure that you are always paying attention. These cars require a lot more responsiblity than a normal car would.

58DEF94A4FAB,"Driverless cars are a futuristic thing that everyone has always been dreaming of. They are cars that can drive themselves while the passangers just relax and sit. Now, although this may seem like a very good and helpful thing us humans could use, it has its problems. Which is why i think we should not have driverless cars.

One of the reasons that I believe we should not have driverless cars is because a lot of taxi drivers would lose their jobs. Even though in the passage it says that it would use

""half the fuel of todays taxis"". If the cab drivers lose their jobs, we could patentially be hurting a family. Although it does not seem like a very big issue it is still a problem that comes with the car. Unemployment rates are already low. Having people lose jobs due to a car? It doesnt seem very fair to struggling families.

Another reason i believe we should not have driverless cars is, its patentially more dangerous. Even though the car could have more knowledge of what to do, because thats what it was made for. See the problem here is that with all of the computers involved with the car it is easy for hackers to hack into them. If a hacker messes with the computer software it could really mess up what the car was designed to do. If someones computer in the car starts to glitch and fails while driving this will end badly. Multiple wrecks could happen all at once. Just like the passage says ""if the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault"".

One argument a person could use is that the cars would have more knowledge about driving than an actual person would, which could be helpful in reducing car accidents. People drive wrecklessly all the time. Which yes, this is true. Think about the future though. If we have only driverless cars in the future no one would even have the slightest idea on how to drive. I am sure they would at least get the basics of driving but what if one day the computers just fail and the internet is no longer of use? People who are on the road when this could occure may die. With with this kind of problem, their would be far more fatalities than a couple of wreckless drivers on the road.

In conclusion I believe that we should stick to our regular cars. So many things can go wrong with driverless cars. Wrecks could happen, and many people could die. Although even with regular driving fatalities can happen I just think it would be much safer to stick to our regular cars.        ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FAB4AD7890A9,"In the year 2032, and a new product is talked about all around the world: in homes, buisnesses, schools, and churches. For several days, many people gabble about the aspects of a car that drives itself and is safer than most cars with excitement and jauntiness.

For many people, this anecdote is the ideal future and one that will hopefully happen soon. Development of automated cars should be funded and researched more thoroughly because automated cars make roads safer, are more luxurious for the passenger, and are not completly driverless.

In ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", the author states ""Google has had cars tha could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"". Because of this fact, cars are safer. Automated cars have radars, and sensors all around them to know where the cars are at any given time. this includes the LIDAR which creates a 3D model of its surroundings, making the entire experience safer and causing less deaths each year. in 2013, BMW developed a car which can go up to twenty five miles per hour if the driver keeps his or her hands on the steering wheel, adding to the safety features on these new cars.

Another reason why these cars are fundable and should be reashered more is the fact that the new car rides would be more fun for the passengers. For example, these cars would have displays that let people watch movies and play video games. The moniters turn off when danger is afoot, which adds to the safety features on the new automated car.

For people who are still worried that the cars will be unsafe because a computer can't decide what a human can and can't perform complex actions, do not fear. Automated cars will not be devoid of human interaction. According to paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are deesigned to notify the river when the road ahead requires human skills.""

The new cars have also been designed to warn passengers to oncoming dangers by vibrating, speaking, or flashing lights when danger in near by. GM has developed a car which vibrates a driver's seat if his or her car is going to his an object behind them. This creates a car to human relationship that insures cars on the road are safer and cause less deaths per year.

In conlusion, automated cars are the future. They are safer, more relaxing, and are not completely automated. The future is looking bright for thse new cars. People should expect new and exciting cars to not drive in the near future.             ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9411BF4CF714,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it talks about how different companies are making cars that can be driven with no driver, but some have made ones that are almost driverless. Some companies used different ways to achieve that goal but some failed. In some states you cannot even test out driveless cars. There is an arguement wether people agree or disagree with the car. There are both positive and negatives of driverless cars.

There is a positive side to having driverless cars and one of them is that it will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexability than a bus. There are cars with sensors so if you come close to a pole or something it will make a noise so you can stop before you hit it. The sensors will also be able to control the breakes and reduce the power of the engine. That will create a better response and control than a human driver. It will be much more safer if we have driverless cars because if a perosn is texting and forgets to stop the car, it will stop itself not causing any accidents.

There is always a negative side to everything and the negetive side to this is that if we rely too much on technology to do everthing for us then we will not know what to do once it fails us. Lets say that we finally have driverless cars and there is an accident ahead, but the car does not stop. At that point what will we do? We will not be able to stop the car because we forgot how to use one after all these years relying on the technology. Like it said in the article, if the technology fails and someone gets injured whose fault is it? It said in the article that some cars are partly driveless except when going up or down driveways or going past an accident so at that point the drivers have to take control. We will all still have to learn how drive.

We should go against the development of these cars because at some point all technology might fail. It may seem safer to have the driveless cars, but I think that if cars have sensors to prevent some things then that will be fine. We cannot rely too much on technoloy even though it is extremely useful. Technology has helped us save lives in the past years. There is more negatives than positives so in that case I believe that we should not allow driverless cars. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
C706F9D46394,"I am against the development of driverless cars for many reasons. Personally I feel as though people are starting to get more and more lazy these days with the help of technology. I believe it would be much more safe for someone to manually drive a car, rather than put your trust into a computer. There is a wide range of possibilities that could go wrong with driverless cars out on the roads.

My first reason is that the car could malfunction. Whoever programmed the car could have messed up and gave the car a defect. Then someone would buy that defected car and most likely get into a crash. Someone could be on a highway while the car system fails, crashing into a semi truck. Theres a possibility that the car could completely shut off, leaving you stranded in the middle of nowhere. Also GPS these days isn't very reliable, the car could take you completely off route trying to follow GPS.

My second reason is that someone could hack your cars system. Somebody that strongly dislikes you could get in your car and ruin its system. Even worse, people would start paying a hacker to destroy car systems. While you're out on the road relaxing in your driverless car, a hacker could take control of your car giving it directions. That means while your stuck in your car, someone is in control of your life deciding if they want to crash your car.

My third reason is that it's not very safe. I don't think putting all of your trust into a vehicle is a very smart idea. The sensor on the car could go out with your knowledge, causing it to crash. There could be road construction that the car is not aware of, potentially driving straight into the construction site. Your city might have certain driving regulatons that the car won't know about, which could give you a ticket from a cop.

My fourth reason is that you could be put at a higher risk of getting in a car accident. What if a little boy is getting his ball in the road? The car might not see him with the sensors, causing the car to drive right into the boy. You could be texting on your phone and then out of no where a car is comming right towards you. It's too late to gain control of the car because you were so busy texting, resulting in a car crash. Maybe you're tired so you take a nap while your car is on its way to the casino. Your car could crash at any moment, because you're not awake and not paying attention to the road.

In conclusion, there are multiple reasons why a driverless car wouldn't be safe. whether it's due to a malfunction, hacker, or even safety issues driverless cars are not safe. I hope after reading this you realize there are way more cons than pros with driverless cars. It's better to do things right by yourself, rather than putting your trust into technology.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BE134CD245B0,"My opinion on this whold driverless car deal is that it's not a terrible idea. I just don't see to much to offer besides a car that is just a waste of time on the road for everyone else. They have to test the car to be better and I understand that it's just that maybe we're not ready for cars like this so soon. As time goes on humans are more dependant on technology and we can't do that forever sometimes it's good for us to not rely on it so much. With cars we drive ourselves around and are alwayed focused on the road and what's around us at all times we become more alert in a way. Now with self driving cars we sort of loose that awareness of being alert all the time while on the road.

This idea is another great idea to keep the crash records down but it doesn't change the fact that humans almost everyday depend on everything to do something for us no matter how simple it is. Humans are getting lazier and lazier by every new invetion that is being produced. Sometimes it's bad sometimes it's good but in this case it's kind of a bad thing because it's another thing that a ""thing"" can do for us.

566866758AC7,"Self-Driving Cars are Amazing, But too Risky

I believe that self-driving cars would be pretty amazing technology. But when it comes down to it, how trustworthy are they? Considering the fact that you're leaving your safety to a computer. What problems could arise? A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen?

Your car could easily have a malfunction. Maybe the gps could take you to the wrong location and you're in a hurry. Maybe it could not drive how it's supposed to. It could go to the other side or the road or run off the road. A self-driving car could possibly cause crashes. This goes back with leaving your safety, your children's safety, your family's safety with a computer.

A self-driving car could cost more to repair than a normal car. These cars would have to all have built-in gps systems, sensors to know what's around them, and sensors to know if there is something on the windshield. Since normal cars have drivers to manually do all this stuff, it only makes sense for all this to be very expensive. Extra parts that are not in a normal car could cost more to replace since they are not in as high demand.

Who do you blame on a crash if it happens? Nobody will know for sure. Is it the other drivers fault or is it the maufacturer of the self-driving car's fault? These are all major if questions. Also, if you are injured in a crash, who will be around to call the ambulance if you're alone and unable to get to a phone? These cars just seem too dangerous and too risky to trust.

A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen? The idea seems great, but also scary.

CDF6072AB1D6,"The Case of the Driveless Cars

How many movies have you seen that depict the future with advanced technology such as holograms or even driveless cars? How much of a reality could that be? The case of driveless cars has been something that has been going on for awhile. Even around 2009 Google came out with their first almost driveless car. Although driveless cars are depicted as futuristic and magical, really driveless cars seem like more of an endangerment to our economy, our safety and our time.

To begin, the manufacturing of driveless cars is insanely expensive. Where would all this money even come from? We would have to fund it to provide research for a car that doesn't know how to back out of a driveway yet. There has already been 200 million dollars spent on radar a device on a hiltop. So why waste money on something that only goes up to 25 mph and won't even drive if you don't have your hands on the wheel? It seems like driveless really just means assissting. But assissting to who? Obviously not the wallets of the buyers.

Secondly, the driveless cars are supposed to help for the better of the people, they say it would be ""safer"". But where is the proof that it is safer? Many states have already banned the use of any self-autonomous cars, just leaving out four states who have left them limited use to test out the cars. How can the world just expect for these cars to be safe when we already have superstition over these cars and those who don't will barely let them use the cars too? They also suggest since the driver will probably be bored that they should put in some entertainment in the car. But what happens when, the car stops and has the driver do what they're supposed to, but they aren't prepared because they were entertained by something else? It's unsafe to assume that having all these distracting things around people who are supposed to be driving won't effect how they do in a sudden situation. There is also the hastle of having to reconstruct the roads, which goes back to the point of money and also safety. It is never safe when there is construction going around, especially when they have to reconstruct the whole road in order to make the driveless cars work. This also leads to the third point.

Time is very limited in this day and age. We barely have time to do anything, we have so many errands to run, so many things to do, but it's like we never have enough time. If the expansion of driveless cars would continue we would have to reconstruct the roads, delaying many people with getting to work or going to school, or just everyday things. Then we have to go to the government too, to repeal the ban put over on many states. So, naturally, that will take forever too, because when does the government ever get such controversial things solved super quick? Why waste the time of millions for something we aren't sure of yet?

All in all, the manufacturing of driveless cars is pointless when the car isn't even really driveless. It seems more of a hazard to the economy, the safety of many, and the time of others than it does as an ensuring safe way to get around. In the case of the driveless car, the driveless car lost. There are too many negative effects for it to ever succeed.   ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
22C6C0356324,"The progression in the development of driverless cars is not a recomendable idea and would do more harm than good for drivers. With self-driven cars, drivers would become lazy and unfocused in their driving. The development of such cars would not only pose threat at every turn for the passengers of a car, but would also deprive drivers everywhere of basic driving skills and knowledge.

The main reason that driverless cars would be a danger to society is simply that they are electric, and malfunctions occur in technology frequently. It is stated in paragraph 7 that the vehicles would be equipped with ""driver's seats that vibrate"" or ""flashing lights on the windshield"" to warn the driver of upcomming terrain that the car would not be able to maneuver on its own. The problem in this is that if a battery were to go out in the flashing lights or the vibrating seats malfunctioned, the driver would not be alerted of the forthcoming danger, and a crash would be innevitable.

Another threat posed by the innovative vehicles is the driver becoming too comfortable in the vehicle. When the driver places all of his trust into an electronic to keep him safe, he loses his focus and edge needed to be prepared for potential dangers on the road ahead. If another car or other unexpected object, such as a deer, were to pull out infont of an electronic vehicle suddenly and without warning, the chances of said vehicle stopping on its own are slim to none. In paragraph 8, ""in-car entertainment"" is promised to ""'interpret the fun of driving in a new way'"". Including in-car entertainment to drivers is doing nothing but promoting distracted driving. It is included in the article that this form of entertainment would be safer than texting and driving because the system would shut itslef off when the driver of the car was needed. This claim leaves a great amount of room for error, such as the fact that people often fall asleep while watching a show or movie because they feel relaxed, so it is innevitable that this would also happen to a driver being distracted. A self-driven car would be promotting laziness and unawarness in drivers and would lead to more crashes because of this.

The development of a driverless car is not a logical idea for numerous reasons. Drivers would be more likely to become distracted from the road and from doing their job as a driver in a car that only partially required their attention. A self-driven car would be unreliable and unsafe to the driver, passenger(s), and others around the car. Cars were designed to be driven by a driver, and manufacturing them to be driven by themselves is encouraging people to place their trust and safety into something that is not dependable and reliable. To conclude, producing a vehicle that is self-driven will promote drivers being lacidasical and unfocused, and will thus lead to more crashes and failures on the road.

92741F116D33,"As time goes by, many technological advances come about and many change the world we live in. Within a few years there have been many new inventions that have completely revolutinized the way we live. Some people like the new ideas that are brought up and some don't. It all depends on who has a purpose to use it. The idea of cars that can drive themselves have came up and have some scratching their heads. Many do not want to have one of these cars and the developers are trying to find ways to improve them. As they continue to test them and see if they are ready to be sold to the public, the public can only wait and see how this will turn out.

Vehicles have been improved year by year and there always seems to be a new model that comes out and is said to be the 'best' that has ever been made. The people want them and no matter what, there are always some things that bug the owners. As new models come out, the prices of the vehicles go up. Just imagine the price of a new car that is able to drive itself. We have no idea how the cars will affect our everyday life and what changes it will bring as well. I personally believe that these brand new cars will not be a good thing to have. It could cause anger and we could only imagine the price to get one repaired if it were to be in some sort of accident. With a slow limited speed, it would cause the other drivers on the road who drive normal cars to be very aggrivated. The weather also brings up a new con in the public's mind as we wonder how the car will run in something such as snow or heavy rain. The car is drives itself until it reaches things like moving past an accident and moving through work zones. It may have the driver bored out of their mind, waiting for their turn on the wheel and has people wondering if others are able to be in the car with them. Could the car cause accidents and will be available to all who are able to afford it? There are so many new ideas that can have positive and very negative affects.

1400B6BD2346,"Are driverless cars safe? A new invention of cars have been created which allows you to drive without necessarly driving. In many ways this is a smart and creative way of thinking. Though it does have some negative sides to it. Though in some cases I would argue for the developement of these cars.

In many cases driverless cars are more useful and environment friendly. It would use half of the fuel used today by most cars and offers more flexibility than a bus. Even though they are considered ""driverless"" they still require the same amount of attention as you would if you were actually driving. Some of these cars have been tested and can drive more than half a million miles without a crash which is higher than average vehicle which can travel less and is more likely to crash. These inventions do the samething any normal vehicle would do, they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. This means that it could give driver a break to relax while stil focusing on the road. The individual gives all prioritites to the car itself but when the driverless car senses that it there is something ahead or near that it cannot do by itself it will alert the driver. The car has things such as vibrating seats and flashing lights on the windshield to alert the driver.

Not only does the driverless car drive by itself with the help of some human skills but it also helps with safety issues. The driverless car has a invention of sensors that are on the far which are said to ""Allow far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" The built in software can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine when it detects out-of-control skids or rollovers. Also it can allow drivers to do thinks such as text and drive without having the safety issue of recking because the driverless car is driving for them and can alert the indvidual when he or she needs to take over.

Although the driverless cars have both positive and negative aspects about it there are far more positive things to say. It allows drivers safer than any human could possibly driver and it also also the driver to have a break while still being able to focus on the road. While the only negative concern is if you wreak.

Especially when they are first available, driverless cars would only endanger everyone around them. Their mechanics or sensors could suddenly fail at any time. Also, it will take a while for the manufacturers to perfect the cars, so therefore these cars will be even more hazardous at first. In addition, I am positive the computer geniuses out there would surely find a way to hack and take control of the cars somehow and commit murders. Detectives may not be able to find out who is committing such awful crimes, considering it could be anyone, and it would not take much effort. Furthermore, driverless cars will be completely pointless; the driver will always have to keep a close eye on what the car is doing and make sure it does not do anything wrong.

I think it is better becasue driving a car keeps the person more sharp at the mind and aware of the things around them.

Although this would be a great idea to keep down the risk of drunk driving casualities a year.

To me I am honestly neuatral on the whole idea with driverless cars, but I can visualize how the cars can be good for society, and i can see how they could create major problems too.

The passage shares two easily argumentable sides of the story, The more postiive side being that there is an advancement in technology and that They would use half of the fuel we use now and would be better for public transportation.

Althought the cars themselves can also create some problems.

They talk aout how some of the cars arn't truely driverless yet and can't manuver around things such as road blocks, difficult traffic situations, and construction and have to alert the driver to take over.

Honesty, I believe that the person would get bored and that there can be more cons that outweigh the pros when comes to the idea of the road laws and what would happen to someone if the car malfunctions. Do they blame it on the individual or the manufacturer?

I think they should wait on proceding to put out the invention of drivless cars until they are fully certain that they have everything they need to make the car safe and reliable for the road conditions.

1DC257172C29,"Driverless cars should not be developed. The cars still need the help of people to perform some activities. The cars also will have millions of sensors that at any one point if one goes bad the whole car would not be able to function properly. Driving also requires the driver to be alert at all times. Driverless cars are going to have ways to entertain the driver instead of keeping the driver focused on the task at hand. With all of these potential problems driverless cars should not be developed.

The cars can brake and go on their own to help the person driving. They also vibrate when you are about to back into something or are drifting into another lane, but they can not correct these things. Some cars can drive themselves but can not function properly when coming to a roadwork area or an accident scene. If a car is incapable of dealing with these contingencies we should not develop them.

Cars that can drive themselves need millions of censors just to stay on the road let alone the lane. In paragraph 4 the prompt talks about the cars using LIDAR which is a device that projects a laser and spins on top of the car. Every rotation showing the computer the cars surroundings. While on the road however the LIDAR could spin around and before it get around again an object could have found its way to being in the path of the car giving the car, depending on its speed, hardly any or no time to react. Other sensors could go bad or just the slightest miscalculation or glitch in anything could spell disaster for the car and its passenger(s). These cars should not be developed given today's unreliable technology.

In paragraph 8 the questions, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" and, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"", were asked. In the same paragraph the author answers the question by saying, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in new way."" Manufacturers hope to fix that problem by introducing ""in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.""(Paragraph 8) These same ideas contradict the claim in paragraph 9 that says, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acieved with alert drivers."" How can drivers be alert if they are busy ""having fun"" before the car decides to hand over the controls to the driver. Driverless cars are just going to cause more accidents due to the lack of attention the drivers are giving the road.

You won't necessarily be driving but assisting the car even though the car drives on its own. That doesn't mean you may text on your phone even though your not driving, you will still need to pay attention and alerted just in case. Like, if there is a car accident, work zone, or if you are putting the vehicle into reverse, that would require human driving skills like the passage stated in paragraph 7.

This shows that these cars are safe and there are still being more improvements made to make the cars even more safe. It also talks about how these cars would save money which is a good thing for everyone because we could use the money for other important things. Personally, I am running late often which is not a very good thing but these cars could help anyone who is in a rush and needs more time to finish something because they would not be the ones driving. You would just need to be prepared to take control of the car at any time in case the car needs human skills to accomplish something. The cars can break, steer, and accelerate by themselves but they still need help from a human driver when it requires human skills. Which means you still have to be paying attention to the road which is really one of the only bad things about this car.

These cars are safe, save money, and help you finish things that needs to be done by giving you time in the car to do it. The cars would truly benefit you.

I think many of the laws would have to be strict. If the driverless car who would be responsible the car manufacturer or the person in the car.

This driverless car in the future should not be allowed in my opinion its just not safe to have them around because no one is in control of the car. So i would not buy this car i would stick to the steering wheel where i will have control of me vehicle.   ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
015F1D312253,"Intro:

I know some people would love not to have to drive cars around and that's all well and good, but what people don't understand is that driverless cars are dangerous in my opinion. I would rather be safe driving in a car, than to be riding in the car with no driver

Body:

Let's just say that if someone driving a regular car and someone were in a driverless car, it would be the person in the driverless cars fault. Why? Because they don't think they did anything wrong and that they're following the driving laws. I don't think the person that was actually driving in the normal car is at fault, they may seem old fashioned but at least its safer.

Being the cofounder of the Google company doesn't mean you know everything, especially about transportation. This is just an idea but it doesn't mean it should actually happen. I understand that some people love cars that drive for them now but at least they still have steering power. I do however like that cars can brake for you when you're not paying attention. And I know that even driving in normal cars is dangerous, but its much safer being behind the wheel than to be just sitting in the car doing nothing.

Driving shouldn't be fun. It should be about learning, and to me learning isn't very fun. Driving to me should be a symbol of growing up not so you can go pick up your friends and go out. Maybe on some occasions, but overall its just a means of transportation from one place to another. But hey, this is just my point of view.

Conclusion:

Some people may not agree and call me crazy, but at least I know I'll be safe when I'm actually being the steering wheel. I would rather not see so many people in the hospital or dead because they wanted to not have to drive to their destination on their own. Driving isn't a terrible thing, it's when people start getting fed up is the terrible thing. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
87FC88069466,"I believe that the use of driverless cars is a decent idea, although it does have it's downsides. The idea of drivers and passengers not having to drive themselves would provide a luxury feel to most participants in the driverless car ""movement."" This could also help with very common safety issues: texting while driving, intoxicated while driving, or just flat out not paying attention.

In paragraph 10, we see that not only is the driverless car and idea, it's happening. If these manufacturers are still running on track, then we should start to see the sprout of driverless cars this year. This implys that people need to start thinking and making decisions on whether they want to sit back and let a computer do the work or not. While I can see the problem of boredom, stated in paragraph 8, I think that this would empower the driver more. He/she would be able to kick and and enjoy the ride without paying 100 percent of their undivided attention to the road. Long trips and vacations would be made much easier with this, or even for truck drivers who drive late at night.

The United States has been exposed to a large amount of deaths from texting while driving, this could be the end of that. While they would still need to pay slight attention to the warning signals given that they need to grab the wheel, if the driver picked up his/her phone while a computer drove them around, it wouldn't be too bad. Another issue imposed on drivers is being intoxicated and driving. This would also be solved with a driverless car. The driver wouldn't pose a danger to themselves or the passengers in the vehicle if being almost chauffered around. This however could still be an issue if the car needed the driver to take control.

I believe that a driverless car would most definitely benefit drivers everywhere. It could solve many issues that stand due to full attention driving and would cut the death rate from car accidents by a large chunk. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
CF3423ED7018,"In my opinion i think that having driverless cars is a good idea. Many people are very distracted during car rides and do not know how to pay attention to the road. Having drivereless cars will be a good thing for the community becuase it can help nervous drivers get through traffic safetly, help stop texting and driving, and it notifies people of their surrounding so that they will not run into things while driving.

Driveless cars allow people to be notified of their surrounding so that they will not run into things. For example, "" GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" This feauture allows the driver to know when it should stop reversing by adding vibrations to your seat so that they will not hit anything. When the driver feels the vibration it will know that there is an object neerby and it is necessary for them to stop. This will cause less accidents and make it safer for people to drive. The "" blind spot"" while driving will not longer be a problem while driving because you will now have a sensor that tells you when you are to close to an object making it safer to drive.

A lot of people text and drive or talk on the phone while driving even if they know it is not the safe thing to do. The driveless car has a feature called"" In-car entertainment and information system"" that allows people to do this while not putting there life in danger. The text states, "" Some manufaturers hope to bring in car intertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone"" People will have the opportunity to text while the car is driving but as soon as the car is in need of the driver it will take away the feauture so that the driver will not be texting while driving so that will not be putting their life or other peoples life in danger.

The driveless car has a ""Trafic Jam Assistant"". Some people get really nervous while driving in traffic causing them to get overwhemled and maybe even cause an accident. The "" Traffic Jam Assistant"" can help stop that by helping get through traffic safely. For example, "" Traffic Jam Assistance .. The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This feauture will allow drivers some assistance getting through traffic jams. Going at 25 mhp, and sensors that allow it to detect objects near by traffic jams will no longer be a scary experience for drivers.

I think that driveless cars are good for the future. It will help nervous drivers get through traffic jams easily, notify people of their surroundings to make sure they do not crash into things, and help stop texting and driving accidents. People live busy and hectic lives and sometimes driving under stress is not safe. The driveless car will help make less accidents for people and a safer driving experience for everyone.

B48FC4918B8F,"I think there shouldn't be driveless cars because what if they have a malfunction in the system and it becomes out of control and someone gets hurt. We can't trust eletric items or things we can't control to have control of our lives. That just isn't safe.

People can't trust cars to drive themselves because the car itself can't handle some human sitituations like pulling in and out the driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. The cars are going to be to expensive anyways because not everyone on Earth is making enough money to buy one of these cars.

The cars might be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they all rely on the driver to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Traffic laws are still written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times letting us know that driverless cars aren't ""driverless"" at all. What if it rained hard outside and the streets were flooded and roads were blocked, is the driverless car going to try to go through it anyway?

Why want a driverless car that still needs a driver,and if it is driverless its not like you can go send it to go pick up someone. It might be fun or cool to have a driverless car, but its not safe. What if the technology fails and someone is injured, its not the driver's fault, its the manufacturer's fault for creating the ""driverless car"" in the first place. We are doing just fine driving the cars ourselves. At least then we will know what and who to trust.         ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

As a nondriver, I think this invention would be very useful, it would help busy parents do their duties for them, like picking up a child from school. It also feeds those lazy teenagers as they rarely want to move or do anything that requires activity. I am deffinetly for driverless cars

Driverless cars are not exactly ready to be manufactered because there are some things cars cannot do that the driver would have to do for them. In paragraph 2 it says that cars that exsist today aren fully driverless because they alert you in tricky situations, like pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with complicated traffic issues. Certainly this is just a minor problem compared to the actual driving part, and is planned to be figured out in the near future.

BMW made an outbreak in 2013 when they announced the deleopment of their ¨Traffic Jam Assistant¨. This vehicle can drive at speeds up to 25 mph, but there are special sensors that make it mandatory for the driver to keep both hands on the wheel at all time. Human drivers must remain alert, which makes it safer for those around them if something were to go wrong. Cars are alerting the drivers by vibrating seats, and light sflashing on the windsheild, catching the attention of the driver.

Although it would be very helpful and easier for everyone to have a driverless car, it could also be more dangerous. Of course the cars would alert us when we need to take the wheel, but most of the population is involved in their cell phones, what if someone ignores it, or misses the alert of signal? This is why as of now, most states have a law against being able to even test computer-driven cars. Why is everyone slowly relying on technology to do all our work?

Car companies have big plans for the future. In parapgraph 10 it states that Tesla has projected a 2016 reliese for a car capable of driving on autopiolet 90 percent if the time. Other companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and NIssan plan to have driverless cars in the year 2020. As of now there are litlle glitches in the plans and laws would have to be figured out, as well as the safetly and reliance of the people in the car.

1B065440759E,"Smart cars may sound smarter than a human being but how smart are they? Smart cars are suppose to be driverless and use less fuel. In my opionion smart cars should not be developed. A smart car can have a technical difficulty and cause an accident and the fault could be said to be the drivers when it never was. This can bring conflict with the driver and the company of the car which can lead to bad consiquences. The car should not be developed becuase it can have techincal difficulties, have a high cost, they take away the fun of driving and learning.

Smart cars should not be deveploed becuase it can fail on something and have techincal difficutlies. The car may not sense something around its surroundings and won't be able to alert the driver on time causing an accident. It can also have failing on the GPS and go a wrong way. The worst casesenerio would be the steering wheel locking and the driver would not be able to control the car if something was to happen. Smart cars may seem smart and safe but technology doesn't always work how it is suppose too.

Another reason why smart cars would not be a good developement would be the cost of the car. The car may be very high at price and wouldnt sell. It could also get a huge donation to get the car started but that money could be a waste by not having a successful project. The car could need something new and it could turn out to be very expensive and won't get fixed being left alone. The car may also need a special street to give it eletrical signal which would be expensive to remake new streets. Smart cars may just be a waste of money.

Another reason for not developing smart cars is we loose the fun in driving and learning. As a teen, people get excited because they get a new oppurtunity to learn and practice something new. We learn the basics of driving and learn from it. We get more freedom to do things and to go to places. But having a smart car can take that away. A teen won't learn from a mistake they do by not driving and correcting themselves. All a person would do is sit there and wait if anything happens. But a teen can have no knowledge in driving and won't know what to do. And as teens we can easily get distracted and cause an accident if we don't pay attention.

In conclusion, smart cars shouldn not be deveoloped. A smart car may sound smart and safe but when it comes to the real world technology can mess up and cause accidents. A human being should always have control of its own thibgs that being their life or their car. A smart car's technology can mess up, be very hight at price, and it can take away the fun of driving and learning. Smart cars should not control our driving, we ourselfs should.

8FA4E8D0E37B,"Driverless Cars Good or Bad

Can you imagine a time in the future where no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? Well I couldnt imagine a future without buying cars. To buy a car is what mostly what everyone wishes for. Yes there is no technology coming up and by the years it expands more and more each day, but not because of that means that getting the idea of enventing cars that drive themselves is good.

I am against future cars the drive themselves because first there not even proven all the way safe. These cars can get out of control any day and something bad can happen. In the story it says that states will follow as soon as the cars proved more reliably safe, which means that there not all the way safe. Anything can happen and when the driver has control of the driving they know what there doing. The driver knows if there driving right or wrong, But how will these cars that drive themselves know. Imagine one day the system might not work and the car will automatically fail with the system. These cars are'nt safe and until there not proven safe I am againts it.

The next big reason why I""m against it is all the money there going to watse on these cars just to make them and when they come out. Theres going to be millions possibly millions of dollars to make these cars. Instead of focusing on something like this we can focus on bigger things. We already have cars we can drive we dont need to be expanding and wasting money on things that are'nt as important. Just more tax money coming out of people things will keep pricing up. Theres no point to invent cars to the next level if cars we have now are good enough.

My last reason on why I'm against these cars is the when you drive its freedom. Its a priviledge to drive, and when you drive you feel free. If the future brings cars that drive themselves the freedom of the people will be gone. So bringing cars that drive themselves wouldn't be so great for people who love to drive because they wouldn't feel free. Therefore cars are good just where they are.

Eventhough some may argue that having cars that drive themselves is good for whatever reson they might think, I'm against. So, can you imagine the future were no one needs to buy cars anymore? I couldnt. Theres freedom when you drive. Its good to be able to drive yourself. This is why I'm against ""Cars in the Future"". ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Its to risky to have a car drive by its self. Because what if you fall in hard sleep and you get to a work zone. Your going to get in a wreck. Thats putting other people in danger.

What if the sensors mess up and just stops working. BOOM wreck right there.

Theres also good reasons for the driveless car. You can play on your phone because you dont have to watch the road. There would be less wrecks because there is alot of wrecks becuase people are playing on there phone and trying to drive at the same time Or you can do you make-up when you are running late to work or a meeting. You also can save gas. If you save gas more money you have.

If you going on a road trip and you tired just take alittle nap. But they need to put a loud alarm in the car so when you need to drive you will be able to get up and drive when you need to. There would be less people falling asleep behind the wheel and getting in to wrecks.

My conclusion is that the driveless car is both helpful but dangeres at the same time.

Driverless Cars Would Have Negative Aspects Do To The Fact That The Driverless Cars Can Not Navigate Work Zones Or Go Around Accidents Without A Driver .

My First Reason , That They Use Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis , Is Because Who Wants To Keep Causing Global Warming By The Gases That Come Out Of Your Car ? In Order To Even Have Driverless Cars We Have To Have An Earth To Keep Them On . Global Warming Is Basically Over Heating Our Earth And Is Caused By Many Things Including The Gases That Come From Cars .

Meaning It Would Pick You Up Wherever You Are Like A Bus And Taxi But It Would Drop You Off At An Exact Location Like A Taxi .

So If Your Riding In A Driverless Car It Doesnt Know Where Work Sites Would Be Causing Traffic Jams And Maybe Even Crashes . Everyone Wants To Know Whether Their Drive Home Will Be Safe Or Not . Because There Is No Way For You To Inform A Driverless Car That Work Zones Are Ahead If They Dont Have A Driver .

6CFA4016F75F,"In today's world, people often strive for the next technological innovation. As a result, various companies in the technology industry are attempting to develop driverless cars. However, the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" manifests that the technology is not beneficial. Driverless cars should not be developed because this technology is in reality unrealistic and can potentially lead to liability issues.

The idea of a driverless car may seem compelling, but driverless cars are not truly driverless as humans must always take some control of the car. For example, in paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" the author indicates that BMW's developing driverless car has ""special touch sensors"" to ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Since the driver is required to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel, this car is not truly driverless as one might think. Though it may perform some functions of driving on its own, a driver must always be there for special cases. The author furthers this idea in the same paragraph by saying that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" As a result, the author, too, indicates that these developing driverless cars still require drivers. Since not even one of these developing projects does not require a driver, the author indicates that truly not requiring a driver is an unrealistic technology. Thus, one of the biggest attractions of driverless cars, the lack of necessity of a driver, is lost. The author later supports this in paragraph eight by asking, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" This question suggests that driverless cars still requiring drivers are no longer as attractive. People would no longer want driverless cars as much. As driverless cars are not truly driverless, as their name suggests, they should not be developed. The technology that would fulfill what the name suggests is simply unrealistic. Also, driverless cars require an inefficient change since they require such a large change in how traffic control works.

Driverless cars are such a large step into the future that changing laws to deal with them are inefficient. The author indicates in paragraph nine that ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that they only safe car has a human driver in control at all times"" but that ""new laws will be needed"" with the advent of driverless cars. Since the current laws regarding traffic only deal with cars driven by humans, having to rewrite the laws to deal with cars driven primarily by computers is inefficient. This is such a drastic change in the laws that it would truly take much time and capital to rewrite everything. In a society that revolves around cars driven by humans, this presents an unrealistic change in how traffic is controlled. As a result of the inefficience of changing the entire system, the development of driverless cars should be halted. Furthermore, the new laws may struggle with the liability of accidents, another reason why driverless cars would be a negative innovation.

The widespread use of driverless cars means that the liability of accidents is extremely difficult to determine. Paragraph nine poses the question, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" This indicates that a society with driverless cars may struggle with this issue. When an accident with these cars would occur, it would be difficult to determine whether the owner of the car or the manufacturer should take responsibility for the accident. The car would be the owner's possession, but the accident may also be caused by poor manufacturing or programming. As a result, any decision that poses one party as responsible for the incident may lead to conflicts, as either side might hold a portion of the blame. As a result, it is best to avoid such difficult situations by stopping the development of these cars.

Truly driverless cars are both unlikely and harmful to society. Though the idea of a world in which transport is dominated by autonomous machines is attractive, the advantages are underwhelming and the consequences are harmful. Society must not promote the development of these cars. Placing such high hopes in this risky technology will only disappoint.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Also for the people driving the car .

Aslo . it says that Google has had cars that could drive independently , under specific conditions since the year 2009 .

Since they had no option for smarter roads , they turned to smarter cars as it states in paragraph two . In paragraph two it also says that they used sensors and other technology such as : sensors on the left rear wheel , a roatatinf sensor on the roof , a video camera mounted near the rerview , and etc . With all of those pieces of technology the driverless car can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel .

50DD653D6378,"Driverless cars would have never crossed our mind 50 years ago, but today, they are already being developed and tested. Driverless cars are wrong beacuse they could cause a lot more accidents from technology malfunctions, they could potentially cause many law suits and problems in our world, and they will make humans even more technology dependent and incapable of taking care of themselves if somehow we lost all electricity and had to operate cars by ourselves.

Driverless cars are owned and operated by the company who makes them, humans have little to no control on what happens in the car. So if the car crashes, would it be the manufacturers fault or the humans fault? Driverless cars could potentially cause many unneccesary arguments and law suits between manufacturers and consumers. If someone is riding in the driverless car, and the car crashes, the manufacturers should be the ones to blame unless they develop a technology to enable the humans to take complete control if neccesary. Many arguments could be made that the manufacturer didn't program the car correctly anf that is why the person was injured or even so much as killed. This could result in manufacturers of big companies paying millions maybe even billions of dollars in law suits.

Driverless cars could cause a lot more accidents because there isn't someone physically watching the surroundings of the car, and technology as simple as calculators can malfunction sometimes, so would you really trust a car run by a computer with your life? Driverless cars have no human physically driving unless it enables the human to drive, and even then it will be hard to avoid the accident because the car wouldn't inform the human about the incident unles just milliseconds before it happens because they can't predict the future and neither can we. The amount of accidents would most likely skyrocket if driverless cars became an everyday thing because of the lack of control and responsibilty a human has in the car.

Today we have many different things that involve technology. We have phones that we depend on for almost everything we do in life, we have computers which we use to store information, we have calculators so we don't even have to remember how to do simple math on our own. Almost everything we do in life has some sort of technology to make our lives easier. Now we might not even have to drive our own car. Driverless cars could mean that people never have to learn how to drive, and then what would happen if for some reason the world lost all electricity, wifi, and communication signals? That means no more phones computers, calculators, and no driverless cars. People are so dependent on technology today that giving them another thing to be dependent on to not have to drive themselves is going to cause a lot of problems if the world has an extreme crisis. Hardly anyone would know how to drive, which means very little transportation and it will be ahrder to communicate with people.

Driverless cars should be illegal because it could potentially cause ven more uneeded law suits and arguments, it could cause a lot more deaths in car accidents, and it would make people very uneducated on how to get places if the technology somehow stopped working. The world is just fine driving themselves, and on top of everything else we depend on technology for, it would be nice to keep at least one thing we have to do for ourselves just for the sake of human independency. If we create driverless cars, we will truly not have anything left to do for ourselves and there will be extreme crisises if something were to happen to our electricity.

As a member of the United States you must think of all the posibilites. Yes, the electoral college was once a great process, but now there are some changes are in need of being made.

The electoral college is a process in which we select electors. This long and dragged out procedure is many steps that take months to prepare for. First, there must be a selection of the electors which are chosen by the states. Then the meeting must be planed and taken place. Who and why is a hard aspect to decide on voting day for those who have been chosen to be the electors. Votes for president and Vice President must be made. After voting the counting beings. The Electoral College has a total of 538 members. Over 270 votes must be made to elect the President. This process can easily be shortend by using a direct election.

By having a direct election everyone's voice is heard. This means less arguing in the states. Citizens enjoying believing their thoughts are not being avoided. Having the Electoral College taking place is highly unwanted in the US. This is because the people believe a direct vote is more efficient way for them to show who they believe is worthy of being President and Vice President.

Each candidate running for office retains a group of electors from a state. These electors are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. This means if a person doesnt like the electors chosen they feel like they still dont have a say of what is going on in the presidential election.

In conclusion, The Electoral College is no longer a process citizens enjoy. This procedure is too long and citizens dont encourage it.

According to the article,(The Indivisible Electoral College),if the election was a tie it will be thrown to the House of Representatives,where state delegations vote on the president.This mean that people would still have no say in the matter of choosing a president.

At the most basic level the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnner take system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. According to the article,during the 2000 campaign,seventeen states didnt see canidates at all. This means voters didnt even have a chance to vote.

The electoral college should be ruled out in the future because its not who people really want to lead,it could result in a tie, andits unfair to voters. If its removed then there would be better leaders in the future.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E3A689BDA786,"Dear State Senator,being apart of the voting process is extremely important.It's important,because you are helping by popular vote for the president of the United States.Electoral College helps you get a better understanding of the voting process and the effect that everyone's vote has.However,the Electoral colleges are not a really big help when it comes down to the country.Here is provided information about why they should change election by popular vote.

First to start the discussion,Electoral Colleges were estblished by the founding fathers in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by popular vote.The Electoral College is not just a place it's an important process.This college is made of electors.They have meetings where they vote for the president and vice president.The college is consisted of 538 electors.At least 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president.Each candidate that is interested in becoming president in your state has to have his or her own flock of electores.The electors are chosen by the political party ran by the candidate.This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many.

Next,The Electoral college system only allows voters to vote for the slate electors. The president of the United States votes is more important then the slate electors.The president of the United States is the one responsible for the Country.Most people refer to the most common argument between the electoral college as the disater factor.Like for instance if someone wanted to vote for a specific person you would have to vote for a different amount of slate electors also depending where you lived as well.

Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. Many people believe that,that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves more popular votes is the winner.Each party selects a slates of electors that is trusted to vote for the nominee that was picked slate electors.Even though the Electoral has a lack of conservative reasons, there are five reasons that people think that should be retained. The first reason is the certainy of outcome,second Everyone's President,third Swing states,fourth Big States,and lastly Avoiding run-off Elections.These 5 things are reasons why people feel that these colleges should stay.

The conclusion, the president of the United states is chosen by our votes.We have the power to make this country strong,but we also have the power to make this country a train wreck.Voting is really important this can determine the fate of the country.

Sincerly,PROPER_NAME                                                                                                                   ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
ED8EE1F02203,"A electors  college is a process , not a place. The electoral college was established it is the constitution as a conpromise betweet election of the presendent by a vote in congress and electection of the presendent by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The election college it like what person you want to br the presendent , maybe you dont vote for that person maybe someone will vote for them. youcan votefor anyboby only if you think that person is good for the comminuty.

I think the vic presedent is like to help out with work or it the presendent retired maybe the vic presendent will take out now the vic presendent will be the new presendent. In the story it say that each member that vote in the house of representative plus two fie you senators. You help choose your state electors when you vote for presendent because when you vote for your condidute you are actully voting for your condidate's electors. the certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presendent candidate in your statae and shows which electors will represent you r state at the meeting.

In the story they ask you what is wrong with the electors college. I think the problem is that one the off-change that those electors be anyone not holding public office. The single best argument agaisnst the electorsal college is what they might call the disaster factor. they the people in american should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. is the most worrying  the prospect of s tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrwn to the house of representatives, where state delegation vote on the presendent. And the thing is that the senate would choose the vice-presendent. because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 votes would have sa much say as the 55 representative from carofornia, who represent 35 million votes.

9BE6A3CF1E3C,"The electoral college should not be used and the popular vote for the president should be in active

To begin with,the 'electoral college' is not fair. The people should vote for who they want and most popular vote wins.'under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president ,but for the slate of electorals, who turn elect for president' (paragraph 10 'whats wrong with the electoral college,)Citizens of america should vote for the their new leader. The slate should not then decide the election of the president.

To countine with, many problems can be caused with the electoral college.'the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisisin a century;the system allows for much worst .Considering that the state  legistarter are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.' (paragraph 11 'whats wrong with the eclectoral college.')the system had caused a big diaster in voting history do to the electoral vote. with the electoral vote people have then no choice but to blame the state considering that their the ones who are responsible for the voting.

To continue with another reason why it should not be used is because depending how big the state is (population) thats how many elecctoral votes they get. 'obama ,who won the vote,got 29 electoral votes' (paragraph 21 'big states') 'if you lived in texas, for instance, and you wanted to vote for for john kerry . on the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election,they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral vote' (paragraph 10 'whats wrong with electoral college') people should have all equal votes its not fair for rhode island to get less electoral votes then florida because its size. if the state of rhode island people vote for either party there vote should count as much as florida.

in conclusion the electoral college should not be in use and the popular vote for the president should be in active. because every citizin should have the right to vote for who they want to be their president.                            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
72E8EFB1A713,"There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. There are many reasons why we should switch to popular vote but there are three that are most important. The canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, it would be less likely to get a tie, and the canidate would have to campain in every state because there wouldn't be a winner-takes-all situation.

Most importantly the canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote. The reprsentative electors have the final say in who is elected because they are the ones that put in the votes. An example of this is Al Gore back in 2000. According to some polls Al Gore lost the election thanks to the electoral college because he won the popular vote but still lost the election. Al Gore had recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush but still lost. Geoerge W. Bush had 271 electoral votes to Al Gore's 266. However, this is not the last time this will happen and voters can expect to see it happen again in the future were the popular vote winner loses the presidency.

Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives. In the event of a tie meaning that each canidate got an equal number of votes from the electors the House of Representatives would have the oppurtunity to vote for the president. This is not a fair system in any way because that would mean the representative for Wyoming who is only representing 500,000 thousand people would have as much say as a representative from California who is there representing 35 million voters! There has been many close incidents of a tie so it is possible for this to happen. In 1968 a shift of 41,971 votes would have put the election in a tie. In 1976, id 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii would have voted the other way then the race for presidency would have gone into the hands of the House.

Furthermore the canidates would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be winner-takes-all which means the winner of the electoral votes gets all the votes within that state even if some of the residents did not vote for that party. The canidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the ""swing"" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.

In conclusion the President of the United States should be elected by popular vote because a canidate would not have to worry about winning the popular vote but losing the election, the possibility of a tie would decrease, and the canidate would havw to campaign in every state. These are just a few of the many reasons that we should switch over to a popular vote system, plus who wouldnt wan't to have a little more say in who runs our magnificent country.

BFAA8D19FFA9,""" The Electoral College is a process, not a place."" retorted by the Office of the Federal Register. The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers. The main reason it was established was because it was a compromise between electing the President by a vote in Congress and electing the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College is a timely and outdated process that consists of selecting the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Yes, the Electoral College has helped the United States of America but it has also caused us many major conflicts that no citizen can change. Many Americans are not heard and by demolishing the Electoral College and bringing our ""old friend"" popular vote back in majority of Americans will be heard. This is a free country right? Do we have the right to be heard and vote for ourselves? I strongly believe we do. I vehemetly feel that the United States of America should use popular vote due to the fact Electors can turn sides, in reality voters are not even voting for the President they're voting for the electors, and there is often a major conflict also known as the ""disaster factor"".

""...electors could always defy the will of the people."" Stated by author, Bradford Plumer.  Once Electors are voted for they have our trust and votes in the center of their palms. They could either listen to the people or break our trust. Majority of times more than 15% of electors turn sides and vote for the opposing party. In a survey taken in 2000 more than 60% voted for popular vote by citizens because they were unwilling to put they're vote in the electors hands. Looking at the correct statistics don't you believe it's only fair to the American people that we use popular vote? More than half of America believes it is only right to use popular vote. What about the other half? Well, thinking about the situation, in the end, they will still get what they want and what is needed. But the real question here is, what do you think?

Lets take a quick look at reality here! When voting for the President of the United States of America you are technically voting for electoral votes. Majority of America does not realize that because of the Electoral College you are voting for their votes. As an citizen of the United States we have the freedom to speak and vote for whoever we want. When voting we are basically putting our votes in the hands of the electors so if sides are turned doesn't that basically mean our freedoms/rights are being violated? I advocatly believe it does and the only way we could possibly fix it is by establising popular vote. So why are we waisting time?

Last but never least, popular vote should be established because almost every four years the Electoral college runs into major problems whether sides being turned on or just the system running low. Believe it or not voting is not supposed to be such a chaotic process. Assertions are made with not much basis which causes majority of the problems we face. If we get rid of the Electoral college entirely all the conflicts will vanish. Our founding father would be proud to know that we got rid of the system that was giving America major  problems even if we much appriciate our founding fathers.

In conclusion, I vehemetly feel that the United states of America should use popular vote due to the fact Electors can turn sides, in reality voters are not even voting for the president they are voting for the electors, and there is often a major conflict also known as "" disaster factors"".

88999FCDE08A,"The Electoral college process,is most certainly not a place,Yet it consist of a selection of electors. Throughout time,this process of voting has only failed to work like it should 2 times,Once in 1888,andOnce in 2000. electoral voting is like a process that rules out the popular vote. The electors are the people that make the final decision,Dispite however the popular vote takes place and whoever gets the most majoraty of the votes,The Electoral vote is the most impotant voting process.

The United States Of America states in one very important document,that ""We the people"",as all the people in one,""in order to form a more perfect union""what does those words mean? Well those words mean that not just Electors should have the say in who is voted president,But everyone should have a say as in who is president in the world that everyone lives in,the popular vote is the best voting process,The origional voting process and that sthe way the voting process should stay that way.

Richard A. Posner states that ""it is the electors who elect the president,not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors"". that tells you that your not actually voting for the president,that you're voting for electors that vote for the president,They try so hard to trick us,knowing most people are to lazy to stand up and fight for what is right,that they just ru n over us,as in the people. the ""Winner- takes all""Method is actually awardoing the electoral votes,induces the candidates.

Bradford plumer stated that even Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole and the U.S Chamber of Commerce,have all agreed that the Electoral college should be abolished!.

'We the people"" should have the right to vote for whoever we want becouse we are the people that pay for all of the elector's and the fact that we have to vote for who we take care of is just outragious. the people of the United States should stand up and fight for what is right and for what is fair,We cant just keep sitting back and letting the higher powered peopkle run over us,yes we respect the rules that we are supposed to follow and yes we do what we have to do to survive and live a free and healthy life,but this ""Electoral College""needs to come to a end and ""We the people"" should be able to vote with the popularity voting method.                                   ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
47D48093D896,"Voting falls down into 2 catagories; Electoral college and Popular vote. If it were up to the citizens to decide how to vote some may pick electoral, but others would pick popular. I would pick popular because it should be up to the citizens to decide on how we vote for our nations leader.

If I remember correctly, we the people should have the right to pick our nations president. When using the electoral college system you are voting for the slate of electors who will decide your ultimate vote for president. So really your not voting for the president. But popular vote is a different story. You get to decide who our president will be and your vote counts for something. People need a say on the president and voting the electoral college does not show how many people truly want someone as president. Also accordig to electoral vote smaller states dont get as much votes as they should.

On the otherhand electoral votes may have an upside. When you vote for president you can help choose states electors which some people would rather do. But each party picks a slate of electors to vote for theyre nominee; and those people are very much trusted. Also its possible the winner may win electoral votes but not popular vote. All the reasons to use electoral vote are because of the certainity of the outcome, swing states, big states, and because it avoids run-off elections.

Even though using the electoral vote may please some people I still believe that using popular vote would be the best thing for us. Many people before us tried to abolish electoral college and many still do. "" What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their lifetime, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" (9).

50CA4F9F983E,"changing the election to popular vote would I think benefit us and this country.

I feel like there is no point in voting if the whole election is based off the electoral college. This electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system that runs in each state. candidates dont spend there time in the states they have no chance in winning in, they only spend there time in the states they think they can win in. For example in 2000 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all! Some people in these 17 states didnt see one ad at all. Its not like us voters can control who there electors vote for because some voters get confused about the electors and sometimes can vote for the wrong candidate. Its not fair to us if we dont matter in this vote at all, especially when the people running dont send an ad out to every state and dont visit every state. The election is held every four years and we help choose our states elecotors when you vote for president because when we vote for the cadidate we actually vote for the candidates electors so it doesnt really make an impact on votes and i think that we should vote for the cadidates themselves  not there electors.

601BF2CC9EA1,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I would like to advice you that keeping the electoral collage is a good idea.

Based on all of the voting and advances it has progressed. It has done an easily better job for everyone. Demorcats,republicans and citizens advance this and make it a better world to live in. it restores some of the weigtht in the political balance that large states by population sources say. In other words electoral collages avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

For instance,citizens are what president canidates are more interested in because those are the most important people to be aware off. Especially since their the reason for your presidential election or career. It requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal.

When no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. it is now a best offer to have electoral collages. Reasons why people dont want electoral collages method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying thier states.

In addition, voters in presidential elections are peoplewho want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The electoral collage is a process,not a place. Its process consists of the selection of the electors,the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president. The counting of the electoral votes by congress. With that being it is not a decision that us citizens are choosen to do.

B02AD8EE0DF0,"I would keep it the same because it would put more work on the poll workers because they would have to count all the votes for each president. If they miss a few votes the wrong person could be elected as president. I would rather them keep it the same because its simple, faster to calculate, and easy to read.

I say its simple because you just have to count the votes and make an elctoral vote and then if u have the most electoral votes for that state it mean that you won the vote in that state. At the end it matters who has majority of the electoral votewhich is 270. It'sbasically the same as how much states you've won to see who will be elected as president.

I also think its faster to calculate because when you do electoral votes you would see how many electoral votes yu have out of 538. The majority of electoral votes is 270 so, If you have majority of the 538 votes you will be elected.

It's easier to read electoral votes because you are adding and subtracting only 538 people, but if you are counting from popular votes you would have to add up millions and billions of votes that would be miscounted. If it's miscounted the wrong person could be elected for president.            ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

3983417BC709,"The Electoral College has been a part of America since the beginning, but is it fair? Our country is a Democracy, which means "" For the People"" or "" By the People"". The Electoral College is not By the People. Yes, it has historcal value, but it no longer is what a Democracy is because of population changes and states being added to the country.

To begin with, Source 2 states "" The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state."" There is a popularity vote and then the Electoral College vote, most citizens think that the popularity vote will win because that candidate is the person that the people chose. That is not the case. It just depends on basically how big your state is and how popular a candidate is in that state. The population is the biggest factor that the candidates think about because if they win that state they are closer to winning the election. There are people who want to abolish the Electoral College including past presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. It really just isn't fair to the people that who they vote for and who wins the popular vote may not have a chance to win because he/she did not get the Electoral College votes.

In addition, Source 3 states "" The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who vote for a president, no the people."" When you vote in your state you are actually voting for an elector and not the presidential candidate. In 2000 the popular vote was higher for Al Gore than it was for George Bush, but Bush won the presidential election because he had a higher number of electors in the electoral college. In a real democracy Gore would have won because of the fact he was more popular. The people want to vote directly for the candidate they want not for some person that has been trusted to vote for a party's nominee.

Finally, The Electoral College is kind of fair in a way because it is based off population in each state. There is also an equal number of electors. Source 1 states "" The founding fathers established it (the electoral college) in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" I understand that it is a law set by the men who created our country and it worked back then. It just isn't working in present day.

In conclusion, The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers back when the U.S. was small and didn't have a huge population like we do today. It worked back then, but now there are 50 states and millions of people. They want to be heard. The popular vote would make more sense than having states with huge populations deciding the fate of the election, when it should by popularity of the candidate.

the single best arguement againt the electoral college is the disaster factor. faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their parties canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

perhaps maybe there was a tie in the electorial vote. this is considered the most worring of all. the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

at the most basic level, this is unfair to voters.. because of the winner takes all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.

The electoral collage lets be honest is a huge big unfair process. There are very many steps to the Electoral collage and i belive there are many more ways we can vote. Picking the hardest one in my personal opion is just not to bright. We should have a easy way to help the people running the electoal collage and also help the citizens. There are many resons why doing this wil;l halp the process so we will have our president voted faster.

The eletoral collage has very many problems in its system. a few of them are that when the citizens vote they are not voting for the president they are voting for the elcetors who vote for the presidents. Another reason is Eletoral collage is very unfair. The peeople or the electors that are voting are not always the right ones also depending on which side you are on rpublican or the decmocratic sometimes een for example you are a republican one of your electors could be democratic as i said before very unfair.

Finally everyone gets tired of crummy old boring things! Have you ever hear it is good to try new things? lets face it the system is really old. I believe would shold try differant methods of selecting the president. If for any reason it does not work out we can always try something else or go back too the same way. i belive that we should try something new and not the same old boring unfair way we have been using for years.

E222DEC2AB20,"Dear Florida senator,

I'm a young student, and no I don't have much of a background in political ideas or things, but I know we should keep the Electoral College. This old process was created to make electing a President easier and faster, which I believe it does.

Now, the Electoral College has 538 electors, but a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Some will argue that we aren't voting for a President but we're voting for the people, or electors, behind them. I would say that they aren't wrong, but we aren't just voting for those electors, we are voting for the whole idea behind their campaiging. We don't vote for the person, we vote for the idea that person agrees to carry out. By having this process, we can focus on getting swing states votes. The votes of these states matter the most, in my opinion, because they are likely to swing at any minute. As said in ""

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President

"", ""swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that the are going to decide the election."" This helps avoid run-on elections because the small states are likey to just vote for the most popular President, knowing their vote won't really make a difference.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that gives all of the electors to the winning candidate. However, there are a few states that have variation with the ""proportional representation"" idea. The ""winner-take-all"" system actually works really well. Other parts of the Electoral College has it's problems but not this one. With this process it makes it easy to give all of the votes to one person, this means all of the state will be on the same page and not fighting with itself. This process v. proportional representation, is better in my opinion because it's quicker and helps make the presidental process one step easier.

And lastly, it's a tradition to use the Electoral College. The pedigree for this process was created a really long time ago by some of the most outstanding leaders in our country. The article ""

What Is the Electoral College?

I overheard that you are thinking on should we keep the electoral college or not use it any more. the electoral college is the amount of popoltaion  a state has. the distrct of columbia has only 3 beacause its not a state . in my opinino i think its stupid that you have to vote on the population , aka a president cant just have a state like florida or ct just have a state like florida or cali. now its true that the presidental election is very important  but it shouldint have to be taken like this . the presidents always pick the states with the most population or points. yes i think that the electoral college is useless maybe in a draw or something. but the vote should count for everyone no matter what state there in. the state is not the points the people are . most states dont have any campanie ads any where cuz they know that they dont hav e much points .other parties like green party and the tea party they should be more out htere the just demo anf rep. the elector college is widely know as a non-democratic way to vote for presidents. othere parties are imoprtant to like the green party is one of the best ones im my opionio but they have that winner take all system. t most people diagree with the system in place but they cant do nothing. larger states get more attention then the smaller states because the president needs more points . the states not might be bigger in size but population may be bigger .                                                                                                                                                                    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
AC051F2666CA,"Do people vote for the man who runs the country. No, thats the Electoral Colleges job. The Electoral College is a process in which a numerous 538 electors cast there vote from the people of their state want as their president. The people have no interaction but to put in there ballet and choose there own electors who favor the candidate. Congress counts the votes, and if a total of 270 votes are cast for a candidate then they are elected president. For most people this how they think this is but it's not. Who chooses the Electors the answer is the state. So the sometimes the popular vote never wins, but that that happens rarely.

Many people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole dislike the idea of Electoral College for this reason, the popular vote sometimes never wins. Al Gore who won popular vote but lost the presidency to Bush, lost the because of the Electoral College people believed that this was unfair and blamed the electoral college. But there is some benefits to the process, example is that if the people voted the states with the larges population would always keep the balance unchecked,or if there there is a tie in the popular vote we wouldn't have to rely on a thousand voters to decide. But the voters of the Electoral College to decide.

There are some draw backs to the process though. Since the number of electors are the based on the population of a state most state with few population numbers, careless about the election. There are reason why people find that we should keep the process,there are also reason many dislike the idea in the first place.

We should abolish electoral college, its unfair and non-democratic. The presidents  seat should be based on popular votes as the winner. Instead of this Electoral college that is clearly unfair  and has no clear outcome, look at what happened in 2000.

As stated in paragraph 16,""Gore had popular votes"" but less electoral votes than Bush ,and Bush won that year. The problem is the

PEOPLE

are not voting for who should be president,its the electors that are electing the new or next president. This is so flawed needs to be changed like now.

The collage electoral process does have its benefits like if a president candidate increased his popularity in states he knew he could win popularity in, That would gain no electoral votes. The winner take all method sounds like a great idea. As stated in paragraph 20,The most thoughtful voters should be ones to to decide the election, but their is a flaw with that even the most thoughtful people in the world make mistakes. Look at what happened with Nixon. The president is only one person. People make mistakes. Let the People make mistakes instead of forcing everything into a box like congress.

Is their a limit on how many electors the president chooses,I hope so. A elector doesn't have to vote for a president you voted for because your are actually voting for that candidate elector, Witch is so confusing.

3C19A6EF8BC7,"Many people believe in the Electoral college, but I think it's time for a change. The electoral college isn't completely fair to the people. It isn't fair because the elected person that will vote for you could always change the vote so he may vote for whom they like. Instead of electing somone to vote for you and your state, you should be able to vote individually.

The popular vote is more fair than the Electoral vote because each person's vote will go toward the canidate of their choice knowing that their vote will count as much as everyone elses. This will most likely result in more people voting and a smaller chance of a tie. Just because someone is representing their voters, doesn't mean that everyone will be happy with the electoral voter's decision. People who are for the Electoral college claim that it invariably produces a clear winner. This is partially true but is not completely true. It might produce a clear winner, but it is not a fair vote. If America is about rights, fairness, and freedom then why do we let other people vote for us?

The electoral overthrows the popular vote, so why should we let 500 people decide who beomes President for millions of people? We shouldn't. The Electoral college is out of date and if anything it needs to be updated so it is more just and fair for everyone. Even in source three it clearly states that the people do not vote for the President- the electors do. So when you vote, you're not even voting for a President. You're voting for an elector. Those for the Electoral college also say that the turst between an elector and state is rarely broken, but why take a chance on someone betraying you when you can just vote for yourself?

7C4D983EB1D8,"The bacics of the Electoral College that you learn in middle school is that that's how they elect the president. They have this thing called thet popular vote which is the states mojority vote which is when they hold elections in the states. Then there is the vote in Congress which is congress making there vote and they use the popular vote to help decide. But this was all established by the founding fathers to be a compromise.

In the electoral college you have 538 electors and 270 is the majority of the votes required to elect the president. Your state has a certain amount electors to go when Congress has it's vote. your states running canidate has their own group of electors  from there polotical party. states have laws on how they are selected to be in the canidates group and they also have a say in what their responsibilities are.

the president stays in office for four years then after those for years they hold a new election and the president can run again and can be elected back into office but they may only serve as president twice but once youhave elected your president you have everyone in state office that went in and voted in the congress vote. i think that the popular vote is much easier and that we shouoldnt have the state represenetives going to vote in the electoral college. the state oard of represenitives can vote along with the citezens that vote in with the popular vote.

to conclude the popular vote makes much more sense then having the electoral college. Now that I know more about it because I never actually knew that there was more to it then just going to the city hall and writing a name on a piece of paper the popular vote makes much more sense when the canidates compaign he will talk about ""the people"" not just the board of represenitives the peoplenon te board are citizens like us they can vote like us when you really think about it you are saying they are higher just because they got elected on the board that doesnt mean they do a good jod or they alwaysmake the right desision so if you base the vote mainly off of them that could be a total mistake they may just base their whole vote off of one miner detail and miss the big picture.                    ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
BC2333002957,"Dear state senator,

There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electoral college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this arguement, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electors. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation.

In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. The electoral college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. Each state is given a certain number of electors to represent its population (Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electors than California). It seems alright, until you realize how unfair it really is... In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented.

Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more inprecise than popular voting methods. While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In '

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country.

In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electoral college votes, as such in the case of Nixon vs Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electoral college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electoral college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electoral college is an unjust way to elect presidents.

I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term.

2D6C17A5D197,"Dear State Senator,

I think the Electoral College shouldn't decide on electing the president. The electoral college only focuses on electors from the state that are pleged to one of the candidates trying to win presidency. The people are not actually voting who they want to become president. Somrtimes the Electoral College can take a long procces. If there is a tie between two candidates, meaning they both have 270 Electoral votes, the house of representatives would have to decide.

There are reasons for retaining the electoral college despite it's lack of democratic pedigree. Certainty of Outcome, if one of the candidates has the most electoral votes that candidate wins office. Onother would be the number of electors a state has, for instance, if one state has a bigger population than onother state it would contain more electoral votes for a candidate.

47C517E48BA4,"The time of the founding fathers is long gone. Times have changed which means we have to change our way of thinking. Our way of voting. The Electoral Colege needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their prefered president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people.

Initially, by keeping the Electoral College individuals are less incentivised to vote if they know there is little chance it will do anything. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Source 3, 23). However, by implimenting popular vote, many more people will want to vote knowing that even if their side does not get the majority vote in the state, it still counts for something. Also, from that same source it says ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College methos is not democratic in a modern sense."" (Source 2, 15). So one would have to ask if the source is even reliable if it contradicts itself. In addition, even if they usually vote ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" (Scource 2, 13). This shows that states with more electoral votes will have more power over the people. Clearly, the Electoral College is a problem and popular vote is a much better way to vote.

Furthermore, because some states old more power than others wen it comes to elections, presidents often ignore the ""smaller"" states looking only for votes. For example, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" (Source 2, 13). Candidates are not interested in the states, in the people, who do not give them enough votes. This is why the Electoral needs to be abolished and replaced with popular vote elections.

Moreover, just because a president wins the campaign, does not mean that the candidate won the people's votes, it only means that he won the Electoral College's votes. For example, in the 2000 election and the 1888 election, one party won even though majority of the votes went to the other. In the 2000 election, even though Gore had more popular votes than Bush, he still lost because he had fewer electoral votes. This shows that there is something broken in the system. Something that can't be changed and needs to be replaced. As you can see, popular votes are the way to go in such an important election like the presidential one with so much on the line.

In conclusion, the Electoral Colege needs to be replaced by popular vote elections because the Electoral College discourages people from voting for their prefered president, influences future presidents to ignore some states, and does not clearly reflect the views of the American people. The Electoral College might have been good in the past however, now it just complicated the process and is unfair.    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
271F225F5346,"Dear Florida senator,

I am writing to you today to address what everyone is talking about which is in fact the Electoral College. It has been that topic widely talked about so i decided to research what it actually means and why it causes contreversy. People have viewed the Electoral College as an anachronism and they argue it should be overruled by popular vote but it is a very strong way to select electors and it wouldn't be in use at the moment if it wasn't the right way. According to Bradford Plumer, the single best argument against the Electoral College is what is known as the disaster factor. After reading ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, it provided me with information like how it was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The founding fathers are very respected individuals mainly because they were of very great intelligence, so that proves how they came up with something professional.

Though it may seem that the abundance of people are in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States, there are people like I who believe and wish for the best like how keeping the Electoral College is the way to go. In 2000, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote happened but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. I agree with Richard A. Posner that it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, I am not the only one who agrees because the facts also prove him right. With being a senator or anyone in office comes alot of pressure, Yet luckily with the Electoral College comes reduction of that pressure. It provides a clear winner when there are times of crisis like for example a run-off election.

The states with a larger capacity (the large states) receive more electoral votes , that is why people argue that it may seem unfair that some states get more participation in the election than others but it is actually very fair since there is more people in that state. I personally believe that the people who argue about the votes are those in the smaller states who feel they dont get the right to vote, it may look unfair but if all states got the same amount of electoral votes given than not everyone in the larger states would get a saying. Also, that is not mentioning the Swing States which are the ones who focus on the ""toss-up"" states. With that pressure the toss-up states are more likely to pay attention the campaign and are the most thoughtful voters and that just proves they deserve to get a majority of votes given.

Considering it may look like changing the election to popular vote may be the right option because it has many small reasons, it is better to have 5 strong reasons than a million unimportant ones to keep something very important. So I congratulate you and the people in office for keeping an open mind of what ""we the people"" have to say but also for knowing that what is in place now is right and should stay this way.                    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The Electoral College has worked for many years but is becoming unfair to the average, everyday citizen.  I've recently analyzed the following articles: ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even best-laid defences are wrong"" by Bradford Plumner, and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner. The United States of America should change to a popular vote for president to benefit the nation as a whole.

If we use the popular vote system, the nation as a overall unit will have some benefits in return. In, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumner, it argues, ""voters vote not for a president, but for a slate of electors"". This statement is very much true. Citizens may think they vote for president, only to realize that he or she is chosen for them. The worst part of all, most don't know who the electors are. To strengthen, in, ""What is the Electoral College"", by the Office of the Federal Register, it claims, ""the meeting of the electors where they vote for president"". If this comes to be true, why even let citizens vote? Under this system, thier votes don't contribute to the presidential election. The presidential election should be by popular vote of the people.

However, the Electoral College does have it's benefits. In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, it indicates, ""no voter's vote swings a national election"". This will allow the electors of each state to decide which president if better for the particular state. One voter's vote could choose the wrong president that harms the nation and doesn't help it.

It is clear to see that both sides have their own pros and cons, but the nation should use the system of popular vote. This allows the people of each state to choose which president benefits them.

I would rather want the changing of the election to popular vote because the Electoral college process causes many promblems. First is that it consists of 538 electors and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president(source 1). Also perhaps it leads into a tie in the electoral votings.... it could possibly lead into a deadlocked election(source 1). This process of electoral college does not give the full rights to the voters... its not fair.

My first reason why you guys should change the election to go by popular votes is it causes many promblems, 538 electors is consisted of and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. this tells me that NO people can vote which really does not give you the right to do that because people have always that right to vote. In addition to that it can lead to a big catastrophe. The electoral college process is unfair to voters.

The second reason why I think that we should keep the electoral college is because it would take time for us to get used to the new method. Since we vote every 4 years and if we get a new way to vote there will be a few that wont know how to vote the new way and when it comes for it to vote again people will forget how they voted for the president.

Dear, State Senator

The Electoral college process as you know ,consist of selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, ant the counting of the electorial votes by Congress (Source 1). Under the electorial college system voters don't vote for president, they vote for a slate of electors that in turn elect for president. Some may think ""What the problem with that it seems like a simple process"" but thats not how it works. Imagine the small states, no canidate is going to spend time in a state where they have no chance of winning making it unfair to voters. Theres is also the chance of many segregationists where they don't even take into consideration on who their voting for only basing it on race and or ethnicity. Electoral college is a ""Disaster Factor""(Source 2).Many thing can happen in the mist of this selection where the results can end up in a tie which would cause worries. Electoral college is irrational, unfair, and outdated and shouldnot be as a system anymore.

This ""system"" is unfair to many places across the United States. No canidate would bother going to spend time in a state where they have no chance of winning making it unfair to voters. During the 200 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters 25 ofthe largest media markets didn't get to see the canidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25ofthe largets media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad (Source 2).Seventeen states didn't even see canidates making it a harder decision for those states causing somepeople to not even bother voting. Some may think ""It isn't the canidates faulty that those people didnt vote"" but yes it is the statement is also on opinion and not facts so its not look into carefully.

This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met. Some may say that the winner-take-all system isn't fair to some states because most of the candidates don't even bother going to the states that they know they have no chance in winning. Well this can be argued by saying that this method may help the candidates because if they know that they have no chance in winning in some states, they might specifically prepare a certain speech that may persuade the state to vote for them. Also no voter's vote swings a national election.

The electoral college has many ways that can help a candidate win the election and it might make things more easier for him/her. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the mal-appotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution.  Some may say that the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote is something to worry about. But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a run-off election. If there was no Electoral College, this would put pressure for run-off elections, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which it invariably produces a clear winner.

So all in all, the Electoral College should be kept and stay the way it is. It isn't complicated and makes the election run more smoothly. It provides multiple ways for a candidate to win the vote of a certain state and avoids major problem during the election.                            ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

I trying to understand why we have the system of choosing our state's electors when you vote for president beacuse when you vote for your candidant you are actualy voting for your candidante's electors. This process is easier for most individuals beacause you do not have to sit in a room, for hours, counting up millions of votes; all you have to do is count up the elector's votes in stead. This process is what our founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. How can you be a qualified citizen, arent we all the same? I know that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. So, another thing that I would like to know is do you believe that this process that has been going on for ages is still a acturate system.

Does voting for people to vote for the president of your choice is a great idea. Does it not seem a bit ludacris that you have to choose your state electors in order for your vote to be counted since you think that who you pick as the electors will actually pick the vote you wanted. Why cant we vote for our won presient, why should we have to go through someone to vote for our president. It has been known that president's may be the popular vote winner, but still can lose the presidency. Why is that? Individuals that vote on their electors can not always control who their electors choose for president. Occasionally, sometimes the electors you pick will not vote for his or her party's candidate; they will cast a vote for whomever they please.

Some of these candidates that people choose are what you call ""faithless"" electors because of the winner-takes-all system. This means that most candidates do not spend time in states they know that they have no chance of winning. Meaning, they only stay focused on the ""swing"" states which in other words means the states that will either go for the person they like or against him. During the 2000 campaign, 17 state had not even seen their candidates at all and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not get to see a single campaign ad. So, tell me why we are still using this same system that cheats citizens out of their votes. Is it beacuse we are not qualified citizens?

If you do not already know by now the electoral college is a process, not a place and this process needs to be abolished. Who picks these electors, are they just people like you and I or are they the qualified citizens. They can be anyone not holding an office and the state actually chooses the electors. So, this means that the people really have no place in the president election. The electors are chosen by the state and even if you choose those electors they can go against what you decide and choose who ever they want. What happened to what the people wanted, why are those candidates choosing who runs our country for four years. What did they do so amazing that they get the final say on the matter. No, they are like us so why should we have to go through them just so we can make sure are vote matters in electing the president. Most of America has to deal with making sure are kids are getting a good eduacation, making sure are water or light bill is paid every month, and we also have deal with getting up at seven in the morning working and not coming home untill eleven at night all the while praying that our kids are safe since we could not pay for a nanny. With all of these things worrying us, putting a lot of stress in our minds one of the only things that we should not have to worry about is if our vote is going to count in electing our president. In conclusion, I believe, senator, that we should change our election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.                    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D908D3E78CB6,"Dear Mr. Senator,

I believe that America should keep the Electoral College to elect the president of the United States. I believe this because the Electoral College makes a guarenteed outcome, it gives proper representation to big states, and the president has to have a trans-regional appeal.

The Electoral College has more of a certainty of outcome for an election. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes (a very convincing number) but only 51.3% of the popular vote (not as convincing). The Electoral College also avoids the problem of a tie in the votes. Even though the Electoral College has 538 votes, which would make it possible for a tie, it is very unlikely that there is a tie in the Electoral College. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 only received 43% of the popular votes, but won 301-237 in the Electoral College. Bill Clinton in 1992 had only 43% of the popular vote, but also won 370-168. The pressure of a run-off election is reduced with the Electoral College.

The Electoral College gives the big states more representation than the smaller states. For example, Florida has 29 Electoral votes, while a state like Maine only has 4. In 2012, the popular vote was really close in Florida, but Obama won and got 29 electoral votes. If the same thing happened in Maine, the winner would only receive 3 Electoral votes. If America used the popular vote to decide who won,  the win by a few votes would mean almost nothing, and the big states would have the same representation as the small states.

The president can't win the election by just winning one region of states. The Electoral College has made it that the candidate would have to have a trans-regional appeal. This is desirable for most people because a president that is only popular in one region, and not everywhere will not be a good prsident. This is why candidates don't campaign in places that they know they will win, and branch out to the swing states. These swing states basically decide the election. They are the states that do not favor either the democratic or republican candidate, so they have important votes. If swing states go one way, so will the election. This is why many candidates campaign in these Swing States.

As you can see Mr. Senator, the Electoral College is the best way to go for electing a new president. It has a more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote, it gives more representation to the bigger states, and requires appeal from people all over America, not just people in one region.                                  ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

We should definitely strive in keeping the electoral college for so many reasons. We need to keep the electoral college because it serves so many purposes in the united states. It hepls us decide who our president and vice presidents will be and it is a big help on our state workers.

And most of the reason that people want to stop it is because they think that some of the nominees arent getting what they deserve. We do understand that they put a lot of work in trying to become president but not everyone can win. And to be fair, after the presidential election is over, our govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candiates who ran for president in our state along with the names of their respective electors.

The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are usually voting for your candidates electors.

Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the elecotrs are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. So when you vote for your president your acually voting for the slate of electors.

Having this Electoral College is so much help to our state workers. They dont actually have to do everything now...thanks to the Electoral College.

So please strive to help keep the Electoral College.

E26A84252465,"Dear State Senator, most people in this country may argue that th Electoral College is well layed out system in which according to source #3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"", which means presidents are always looking for support from small states, which is based on population, to be voted for because in the big states little to no votes are accepted by the Electoral College. I disagree, I believe that this method is wrong and unfair for the peope so I argue against it.

To begin with, according to source #2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states"", this means that in some states one candidate might have a better chance of winning than the other candidate and even though a candidate is at disadvantage because the other takes all the votes because of the electoral college that candidate might win and the people of that state will not even know who is this winning candidate until they see him on tv as an actual prsident, which probably means that the winning candidate won't help that state because he does not know well enough about it. Additionally, acording to source #3 ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney ws in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plularity in states that he knows he will win"", this means that in order to win the presidency a candidate must get to know other regions but because in this case Mitt Romney vs. Barrack Obama, Obama was the regional favorite for the North Romney was at a disadvantage, which is what the Electoral College ultimately wants.

To conclude with, I think that the method of using the Electoral College to elect presidents is wrong and unfair. Furthermore, according to source #2 ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdate, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"" this means that the electoral college is just not fit for the modern democrat world of today and mostly people argue against it.

A3960A410B74,"Dear Senator,

My friends father always complains about how the voting systems work here in the U.S. He believes that the electoral votes should not really matter. He strongly leans on the idea that candidates should win an election by the popular votes. Although the Electoral College has helped with many situations before, like the 2000 election, when Al Gore had the more popular votes then Bush yet, fewer electoral votes. I'm started to believe that changing the electoral votes to popular votes would be better for elections of presidents.

Replacing the electoral college with popular votes would be better for elections of presidents because, it's the peoples choice. For examlpe, people vote for the candidates that they more relate too and their choices. Having the electoral college around can make an impact to their choice. Say if a majority of a state vote for a candidate, but the state doesn't have enough electoral votes for that canididate to take a lead or win the election. How can they get there favorite candidate to win the election? The electoral college is blocking that way for that particular state. In brief, people need their say for their favorite candidate instead of the electoral college giving them points.

However, the electoral college has some pros for the candidate and also the states. For instance, the states of california has many electoral points for candidate to win an election. I believe there are fifty-three for that states because they have many representatives. If the majority of the people in the state vote for a democrat or a republicin the electoral points goes to either one of them. Giving that candidate big points to even take a lead in the election.

To wrap it up, the electoral college do have pros and cons in a election. The electoral college can give a candidate the election. But the popularity vote are for the people and by the people. I stiil stay towards to the idea that the popularity vote is a greater way for voting. Remember it does say We The People in the Declaration of Independence which was sighn by our founding fathes.

I know  you have a lot of things on your mind, but I really felt the need to address the way we vote for our president of the United States. Instead of using the Electoral College, I think we should select the president by popular vote. We, the people should be allowed to control who our president is and that not always likely to happen. We can't control whomever our electors vote for. If you keep reading you will see my reasonings for not favoring the Electoral College.

First of all, I favor changing to election by popular vote because of something we might call the ""disaster factor."" Us Americans should consider the fact about how back in 2000, there was one of the biggest fiascos of the century because of the election process. Just think about how state legislatures can just pick electors, and those electors they chose can defy the will of the people. Even if we go back even further to the 1960's the segregationists of the Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones, who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Secondly, I would perfer that he election was decided by the popular vote becayse some people refuse to vote. ""These electors are called ""faithless"" electors. They refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please""  stated in souce 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, in paragraph 11.

Last but not least of all, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Only because of the winnwer-take-all system in each state. Because of this system, candidates don't spend time in states they know dont have a chance of winning. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Back in 2000, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all, which is not right.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I would rather have the decision to vote for our president by using the most popular vote. I feel that we don't actually get to make the decision of who our president actually is. I would like to say that the electoral college is unfair, irrational and outdated.  All in all ,My opinion is that Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!

2099CD327374,"Dear Senator,

I believe that people like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole were all right in saying the electoral college should be abolished. I have two simple reasons for this. One being that it is not a 100% way to elect a entire nations leader for four years. The other reason being that 60% of people don't even want it.

First off, the process of the elcetoral college isn't always accurate. For example, in 2000, Al Gore ran for office against George W. Bush. During this election, Al Gore won the votes of the people, but lost in electoral votes, giving the presidency to George. Since we all know how his presidency turned out, we wonder how Gore would've handled things. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for, which means if an elector is chosen to vote for Billy Joe, he might just decide, when it becomes time, to vote for Jimmy Washington. This would leave voters of that candidate upset, so maybe they too will understand this flawed system. Another reason we need to abolish the electoral college is something we like to call the disaster factor. This is nothing compared to what happened in 2000; the system allows for much worse. Consider that a states legislature is technically responsible for picking said states electors. Also consider that said elector could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, electors without faith, have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast their vote for whomever they please. Ask yourself Senator, if this were to happen again, would you do what is right and try to dispose of this system? I hope so.

In reference to my second point, do you realize that (According to a Gallup poll) 60% of our people don't even want this system. The way I see it, if i asked three people if I should buy a new car or a used car, and two out of the three say I should buy a used one, I'm not going to go buy a new car despite them. This is the same with the electoral college. We shouldn't be forcing this corrupt way of decididng this nations leader for the next four years, down their throat. This nation is based on beliefs that include the peoples right to have a say in how this nation is goverened. It's so simple, a majority of the people are against the electoral college, so it needs to go. If you, like 60% of the United States agree with my points and views on the electoral college, then you need to do what you can with your authority, to put a stop to it.

All in all, I have strong beliefs, like most Americans, that the electoral college is a corrupt way of giving this great nation to somebody who people think don't deserve it. Based on my emphasis of these two reasons that this failing system needs to go, I think you , Senator, need to put all your power into the downfall of it.

Every four years on the first tuseday in November we the citizens of the Unites States Of America vote for the next persident to be in office. As you already know for this to happen the they must have all the Electoral College or Election popluar vote. Which is not how elcetions should be conducted. It should only be based off of popular votes.

Voters do not ways have control as to whom their electors vote for. Sometimes it can be anyone not holding public office. In the second sourse titled

The Idefensiable Electoral College it states, "" Who are electors? they can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committe, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" This indicates that voters have dont really have control. The electoral college votes has many reason for being unfair to voters, and the winner-take-all is one of many. Line thirteen of the second sourse, it states ""the electoral college is unfair. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state"" this indicates that candidates did not and will not spend time in states there they won't win votes. They focus on larger states to gain there votes. It has been said

"" the electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational.""

With this Electoral vote should be eliminated from the final vote. With the popular votes the elcetion can be a fair race to presidence

Bob Dole stated

"" Abolish the electoral college!""

. There are many reasons why elcetoral college should be abolished. But In the defence of The electoral votes this can be the tie breaker. If the candidates come to a tie in popular votes The electoral votes will establish which one recieved the most electoral college votes. But this should only be used in case of a tie in popular votes. ""Elcetoral votes is a lack of democratic pediagree."" Within no region is there enough electoral votes to elect a president. A candidate with regional appeal isn't like to secced the presidency because the other regions will feel excuded. the region will feel as if the president doesn't not care for there interest. People believe that wil the elcetoral votes their votes will have no effect. In the section "" run off elections it states ""

they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president were to picked by popular vote...""

This implies with the electoral college is not fair because voters vote and their vote has no effect on the election, because its based off of the electoral college. And this isnt fair!

To Solve this problem there should be absolutly no more electoral votes during elcetion. All ecetions should be based off of popular votes. you have the power to correct this issue so i should be done. Electoral votes dont give a fair chances. With that being said Elctoral votes should be elinimated from voting the next president.

Electing our president through electoral votes takes care of minor problems such as favorism of regions .Each state is giving electoral votes based on their population , no region such as south, north, east, ect.. has enough electoral votes to choose a president.(source 3 paragraph 19) "" So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"" A president with a favorite region may make the rest of the country feel like their votes doesn't count and the new president will show no attention to their interests and their problems.

In all honestly, getting rid of the Electoral College is for the best. It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people.

Source 2 states that the Electoral college is unfair for the voters because the candidates don't go to states they don't have a chance of winning, because of the winnner-take-all system. The candidates only focus on the tight races in the swing states. Sorce 2 also claims that in the 2000 election, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all! That's pretty rediculous. And voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad.

In the Electoral College system, voters dont only vote for the president, but for electors, who also vote for the president. Then again, in source 2, the article says the the electors that were voted for can vote for anyone they choose. That's some tricky business.

Voters can't control who the electors vote for. Electors aren't even voted for by the people. They sometimes come from state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. The second article says that the legislature is responsible for picking the electors. And these electors coukd always go against what the people want.

Article 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.

Also the winner takes all system should be changes I belive that each of the electorates should only have a certin percentage of the votes example: Alaska has 3 electorates, each are assigned 33.33333...% of the population and of course due to the decimals one electorate will have a bit more votes all the votes are then added. 76% voted Republican while 22% voted Democrat and the remaining 2% voted for third parties then the first elector would recive the votes of the 22% and the 2% and do fill up the rest of his 33% he would have 9% Republican his vote goes to the Democrates but the other two are left with only Republicans so there are 2 votes for republicans and the learger the population the more electors because of the increased ammount of citizens that each elector votes on behalf. This way the indivaduals that voted democrate are shown but did not really make as much an impact but it shows and may decide the out come during a tie.

The Electoral College can keep five hundred and thirty eight electors with two hundred and seventy electoral votes to require the president. For each state has his or her own group of electors chosen by the candidate's political party.

The presidential election is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in november. What most states do is have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. Then win the election is over the governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""with every candidate who ran for president names on it. That means who ever won it represents your state for when you try running for president. The certificate is sent to the congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

Apparently people would rather have wanted a direct election to the kind we have now. When you use the Electoral College your not just voting for a president your voting for a slate also.

Usually the only problem would have to  be a tie in the electoral vote , in case the election would be thrown to the House of representatives were they vote on the president.

Candidates don't spend enough time in states they know they probably don't have a chance at winning so they focus only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states.

For example,""Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, somethimes the state party's central committee, somethimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom thier electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiddate? Sometimes"". This quote just shows how confusing the electoral college is. Another example,""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This quote explains that the electoral college is outdated and should be changed.

To contiune, using the popular vote has less problems than the electoral college. For example ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically resposible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. This quote explains that the electoral college will always cause a problem with voting the president you want. Another example ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality elections are spurious at best"". This quote explans that we should abolish the electoral college and it also points out the flaws of it.

To end this off, I still believe that we should get rid of the electoral college. Wheather it's because it has several problems with it or because the popular vote is much more simplier. This is why senator i think we should get rid of the electoral college.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
D78BFBFC52CC,"Why does this country even have this system? Where someone else basically chooses for you? The Electoral College should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This should change because the people have the right to have their opinion go to what is being voted on,not some else choice also because it's like people are voting for something they don't want foresfuly.  The United States is a what we call a democracy meaning the country is lead by the power of the people.

So when two people have an idea to make something better and another person has a different idea they each want to others to hear their ideas. Each person will have their reasons on why they think the way the way they think and the peolpe will have to make a desicion on what the they think is best for their community and their country. The United States is a democracy which means it is lead by the people. It's the people say. So when someone votes they expect their vote count against what they are going for. You making a desicion and someone else who is higher than you changes it makes voting ironic. Why vote? Just make them do the whole election. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president""(Plumer). So technacally we are not doing the voting we are just what is called ""giving options"" to those who are actually doing the voting. We the people demand to be heard and want what we want. In

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong it states that over sixty percent  of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Point being be should be heard no matter what.

In the United States we are not forced to do anything really. Especially when it comes to choosing. Everybody thinks differently so why should someone else vote for the choice of the people. It's like we are voting for someone we don't want when someone higher that you is voting for you. Each stae has their own number of electoral votes but it shouldn't be that way because it the president your voting for is in a tie and he need those votes the people would know that their votes are helping the person they want to see win. But when the electors choose something else the people cant think that. Sometime the electors refuse to vote for the their party's canidate. which makes the situation even terrible.

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong paragraph 11 it says ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please."" So why even waste time on telling people to vote if someone else will choose for you sometimes not what you want.

In the end having to count so many votes could be dificult and when counting it could lead to mistakenly counted. But we the people make our own desion for our own good.

5FE588C6DDB5,"As stated in the article, the Electoral College process consists of the selction of the electors, the meeting of the electors, where they vote for PPresident and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. A state's entitled number of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional Delegation. There is one for each member in the House of Representatives, and two for every Senator. There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College. The two biggest reasons are as follows: Unfair elections and the freedom of the people.

As stated in the third source, the Electoral College is often considered an anachonism and is unliked across the nation. The reasons for which vary greatly from certainty of outcome to big states to swing states. Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be cosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that recieve more atention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed.

Citizens of the United States of America are the ones who are supposed to decide who should be the President of the United States of America. It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are out-weighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States; they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.

I hope that the voting process will change. I hope that it will finally become fair. That it will become what the people want it to be. It should be what the people want it to be. We the people of the United States have the power to change this, and we should work to change it. The voting process should no longer be the Electoral College but should be dicided by the people and only the people. The voting process needs to be fair and needs to be what the people want it to be.    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
6338DA32662A,"Dear senator,

I agree with keeping the Electoral College until it pulls off a mistake. The Electoral College has no real reason to be changed or modified. It's served its purpose with almost no flaws for years now. Let's take a look at why we should keep our Electoral College.

Our Electoral College is a system made to ensure fair voting for our president based off of how many Senators you have, and how many state representatives you have. This is a fair way of voting because of regardless of you population, everyone has the same amount of senators. This is to ensure a small state like Deleware has the same voice to match a big state like Texas. According to Source 3, one of the main concerns for people who want to abolish the Electoral College is that the people are not actually voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors. But in source 3 it states, "" But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"". This state the although the vote doesn't go directly to the presidents vote, it is most common for the trusted slate of electors vote for the president.

Another concern for people who want to abolish the Electoral College as stated in Source 2 is,""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" If the vote were to be tied then the election will be handed over to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Each state gets only one vote so another concern is that the state representatives will not be able to vote what everyone in the state wants because the number of people would be too much to keep up with. First, why would a state turn its back on the majority vote of who their state wants to be president? If a state should do this, their representative would not be representing their state, therfore they maybe punished of may hear about it from the public. Not only are the representatives not expected to miss vote what their state wants, but also what are the chances of theirbeing a tie. It has never happened before, and the closest its gotten is over 8,000 people having to agree on a single same person. This is an absurd number for people to abide to the same person from different states. Its hard to find people in the same room to agree, let alone 8 thousand people! It just seems to extra-ordinary for their to be a tie in the electoral college.

Although there are many pro's, there are also just a few con's. A large con that should be avoided is what source 2 calls,""the disaster factor."" The legislature is responsible for picking the electors and they have all therights to defy what the people want. A clear example of this would be as stated in source 2,""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislaturenearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"". Should the legislature had been able to pull that off, it could have changed the vote and stopped Kennedy from being president. But seeing as segregation isn't as big of an issue in the U.S, this isn't as prone to happen.

As you can see Mr. Senator, there are many reasons why we should keep the Electoral College until it makes a mistake. The pro-to-con ratio is largely in correspondence to keeping the Electoral College. As long as it continues to do its job, and no one abuses it, I'm in favor of it.

In the Electoral College voters vote for a portion of electors, not the president. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, this process is just undated and not right. A lot of states may not even see their candidates. If election by popular vote is used more than the places that don't, then they should be changed.

It is just easier to decide when there are more or less voters. The Electoral College just has less of a chance to be kept. If every state did the same to elect then it would be easier to decide who should be the president of the United States.    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

As it may have come to yourn notice I would like to foucus your attention to the debate about the Electoral Collage. The Electoral Collage is a unfair process the fathers of the Constintution established.

(Source 1) In other words the Electorial Collage is where we elect represintives to vote for the president. That then makes their vote more important then everyone elses. And let me tell you, you wouldnt want that.

The Electoral Collage was a structure our founding fathers set up to help formally elect the president. But if this process goes aginst the wishes of the people, the ones the Constitution was writen for, then what purpose does it serve? "" Its official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Source 2) Once the Electoral Collage has be  abolished the president can then be elected by popular vote and every one will be satisfided.

""The Electoral College is widely regarded as a anashronism"" (Sourse 3) This means that the Electoral Collage is a thing that seems to belong in the past and does not fit in the present. Im sure that our founding fathers had good intions when they installed this system into our goverment.

E4426C4EBD19,"Dear State Senator,

Many people today have very strong oppinions on why or why not we should keep the Electoral College. I am writing to you today to tell you some of the reasons why the Electoral College should not be used anymore.

The Electoral College, like most things, has room for error. However this is the type of error that you want to try as hard as possible to avoid. Any error here could lead to the false election of a President and Vice President. Now maybe the falsely elected President and Vice President have some wonderful ideas on how to help our country as a whole, but in carrying out their wonderful sounding plans, may have to hurt or cut back other resources to do so which could hurt us. This is just one example of how the Electoral College can go wrong.

The Electoral College has been used for many years and has become an anachronism. We consider ourselves a democracy yet we use a non-democratic method of selecting a president. With the Electoral College comes the certanty of outcome. The winning candidate's share of his/her Electoral College usually exceeds the share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires the president to be a candidate with a trans-regional appeal. Any candidate with regional appeal is very unlikely to be succeful as president. The residents of the other regions will most likely feel disenfranchised and that this candidate is not really their president. The swing states tend to pay closer attention to the campaigns and to really listen to what the competeing candidates have to say. The residents in the swing states tend to be the most thoughtful voters. In the Electoral College, they try to restore a political balance between the large and the small states. With the Electoral College you avoid the problem of an election where no candidate recieves a majority vote which would complicate the presedential election process.

All of these reasons are great and everything but there is always going to be a flaw in the system. Some believe that is is the people who vote in the presidents, however, all we are doing is electing the slate of electors who are are the real people who elect the president. In the Electoral College there is a disaster factor. The electors chosen could always defy the will of the people. These electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. Voters cannot always control who their electors vote for and some voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The most worrying part though is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If a tie were to happen, the election would be thrown off to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations would vote on the president. Due to the fact that each state casts only one vote, one single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have just as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who are representing 35 million voters. The House's selection can hardly be expected to  refelct the will of the peple in the states. The elections can be only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters in its most basic level. Due to the winner-take-all system that is in place in each state, the candidates don't spend as much time if any at all in the states they know they have no chance of winning, and spend most of if not all of their time on the tight races in the 'swing' states.

Like everything it would take some timw to get used to the changes and I understand that. I also understand that election by popular vote has its flaws as well. It is time to change from an outdates, irrational, and unfair method. Thank you for your time and consideration about this. I hope you consider changing from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.

8FA286B4FAE3,"I think the Electoral College need changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United State . Because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiaso was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in state they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "" swing"" state. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyoune has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

B53ED19CD783,"Presidential elections have always been decided by electoral votes. The elections today should be voted on using popular votes. All though electoral votes keeps the amount of work tallying up votes down; popular votes will give you a more accurate percentage of votes each candidate recieves.

Initially, when you use popular votes to decide a victor, there will be a more accurate percentage or number of votes per candidate. Popular votes are counted by each individual voter. This allows a more accurate voting scale to be used, since there is an exact number of voters. Electoral votes are based on a state's population and each region in the state is assigned a democratic elector. This only accounts for the majority of the population's votes, which means some voters' votes are irrevelant if the majority voted for an opposing candidate.

Additionally, counting popular votes, while time consuming, is worth the effort. Popular votes, when used, are to make sure that everybody is accounted for in the poll. More people would probably vote if they knew that their vote actually matters. When popular votes are used it may take a longer time to tally all of those up than it would for electoral votes, it shows exactly how many people are actually voting. This will let the government know how many votes they should expect to see on each poll.

In summation, popular votes, though time consuming, are a better way of electing a new president; instead of electoral votes. Electoral votes are an easier and faster means of counting votes but, popular votes show and acount for everybody that contributes to the poll and/or election. Using popular votes will most likely make more people want to vote, since they can see the amount of voters instead of the number of regions through out the country.

First of all, I believe the popular vote should be kept and the Electoral College brought down. I think this because what if some people dont agree with the opinion of others. For example, lets say two people are running too be president of the United States. People vote and everything but then its up too the 538 electors.

And the President that gets the most votes wins all [In most states] the electoral votes. Elecoral college is a great way to decide the President because having every one decide the President from popular votes is not fair because most people vote for what they hear from other people and if the others are voting for a President they are going to get more than one vote from one person. so having the Electoral College is the more fair way of deciding the votes.

People that are chosen are more cnoledgable and smarter to vote than people that vote just to say that they voted without looking and knowing why they voted for that President and not for the other. Because in the passage it says ""It is entierly possible that the winner of the electroal vote will not win the national popular votes"" and that suggests the point of this essay.

The Electoral College foucese more on all states than the popular votes. because big states like (Florida, texes, etc) have way more people than other states so if a state has 15 electoral votes and a diffrent state had 11 when the first state has double the amount of people in the second state. so that means that the President has to focuse on all the states so no state feels that their votes don't matter.

0A0AA9C21C5D,"Dear state senator,

Many people believe that the Electoral College should be abolished, while others believe that the Electoral College should stay as it is. However, what most people who want to keep the electoral college, do not know is that when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Which means that the people do not get a direct vote towards the president. Therefore, it can cause disinterest in people who are eligible to vote. That is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

The first reason as to why I favor in abolishing the Electoral college is because you can not always trust the electors. As shown back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy so that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. Also, due to the winner-take-all system, candidates do not spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, it is obvious that they just want to win and you can not trust those candidates, especially the people who promise to do things they know they can not fulfill. The electors that ""the people vote for"" do not want to help their state, they do not even care for the needs of the people, they are just there for the money. Another reason as to why you can not trust the electors is because it is known that the electors can vote for whomever they choose and forget about the people's needs. One of the main reasons as to why this causes disintrest in potential voters. If the people vote directly for the president they have a better chance in speaking up and fighting for what they want therefore, trusting. Those are some of the rights that are taken away by the electoral college and people do not even realize it.

Another reason as to why I believe the electoral college should be abolished is because the electoral college is unfair to voters. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. That is more than half of the people! If the government really cared for what the people want, the electoral college would have been abolished by now. Studies have shown that only half of the people living in the U.S have voted in the pasts elections. If you really want the number of voters to increase and for citizens of the U.S to express their political preferences you should actually listen to them and abolish the electoral college.

Lastly, the electoral college prevents voters from controling who they vote for. Many voters now in days believe that when they vote, their one vote decides the election but, they are wrong. If they abolish the electoral college the voters would have a better chance in having who they want for president. The people who vote in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference we'll have more citizens voting if the electoral college is abolished. How do you expect for U.S citizens to vote and express themselves if they are not heard?            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

We should be lucky that the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a century ; but this process could end up getting much worse like in 1960. The segregtions almost led to no more Democratic electors. We still proceed with all evidence as to why we shouldnt have Electoral Colleges.

We do have democratic electors but the Electoral College is a very non-democratic process. People in favor of this say even since 2000 when Gore had more popular votes than Bush but fewer electoral votes it hadn't since 1888 . We are the the people we should have a voice that rings loud and clear , not one who whispers under the big booming voice of the people the higher leaders think have a bigger say. We should be the majority not the minority. Even in favor of the Electoral college you can see the many flaws that have come about the age old process. You have the swing states that follow a ""winner-take-all"" method.

Then we have the big states that use some of their large states. like in Florida the 2012 election the state had a very close popular vote and got 29 electoral voates. Then it came down to Wyoming with 3 electoral votes and it took all.

Now I hope you can see why We should toss the Electoral College out the second story window. The vote's come to close to call in a lot of these runnings. The people we vote for can always turn their backs. Plus it just gets to caiotic to handle even when we treat the district of Columbia a state. Even the people with the popular vote get tossed out the window. The Electoral College should be put down , and Replaced with the Popular votes of the Us citizens.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
A54A1822C7AE,"Dear Senator,

We the people of the United States of America, desire a president who will not only care for the wellbeing of the citizens, but know what to do during times of crisis. The Electoral College is but one method of deciding this. There are many reasons as to why we need the Electoral College, and there are many reasons one can list of why we do not need it. If we were to get rid of the Electoral College completely and determine the win on the vote of the American citizens, chaos would ensue. Let's be honest, there are plenty of voters who have no idea what they are doing. If America were to base who would lead and call the shots of the country on the votes of everybody, then one person would end up being in office who is no better a ruler than a goldfish.

The Electoral College is noted as a process, not a place. This is correct. You don't just walk up to the Electoral College and say ""hey, this is who you should put into office"". Each state in the U.S. has a certain number of representatives(electors). For example, D.C.(is treated like a state) has 3 electors. People may say that the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. While in some aspects this can be true, but if the electors know what they are doing and are willing to stay true to their country, then maybe the correct person would be elected in. The EC is known to require a Presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A trans-regional appeal is when one area of the U.S. is known to be in favor of the presidential candidate.

Among the other things the Electoral College is known as being, it has been widely regarded as an anachronism. An anachronism is a person or thing that seems to belong in the past and not fit into the present time. While yes, the Electoral College is very old, it does have its uses. It is perhaps one of the final things that will determine what direction this great country gets set into, be it forwards or backwards. The larger the population of a state, the larger number of electors it has. Most of the states in the U.S. have what is called a ""winner takes all"" system. This system will award all of the electors to the presidential candidate that wins the election.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, what is known as the AFL-CIO, and the U.S Chamber of Commerce all agreed on just one thing. That thing that they all agreed on was to abolish the Electoral College. Over sixty percent of the U.S. population would rather have a direct election  over what we currently use. Out of all the arguments against the Electoral College, one of the ""best"" is the Disaster Factor. One of the other worrying views on the Electoral College is what would occur if there were to be a tie in the vote. If a tie were to occur, the election would thus be thrown in the hands of the House of Representatives.

While there are many reasons to like, and dislike the Electoral College, one of the most re-assuring should be that it (most of the time) will keep idiots out of the Oval Office. Among the reasons to dislike the Electoral College is that it is unfair, and keeps the majority of American people from using their voice. The Electoral College is the fine line between a country going backwards and causing the rest of the world to hate it, and a country going forwards, causing the rest of the world to hold it to a higher degree. If theres anything that the American people should want, it is a powerful and respectable leader who will do anything and everything they can for the citizens. Sincerely,

What is the Electoral College? Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. The Electoral College is an unfair, outdated, and irrational process. Although many believe it is a necessity for choosing a president, it is not. I believe the process of choosing a president should be changed to the election by popular vote in the United States.

First, what is the Electoral College? In the passage ""What Is the Electoral

College"" it says, ""It is a process by which the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your President because when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors."" But, little did the fouding fathers know it is not really a compromise. The Electoral College is composed of 538 electors. Some of them unfair ones too. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. In source 2 it says, ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your President because when you vote for you r canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors.""

Second, the Electoral College is not a place, it is a process, an unfair, outdated, and irrational process. According to the passage ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" it states how, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president."" Do you think that is fair? This process is confusing and it should be abomished. Due to the Electoral College many people get confused and sometimes vote for the wrong canidate. In the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" it says, "" 'Faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" That is unfair, and irrational. People should be able to have a choice, although they let you feel like you're doing something by voting, you actually are not doing much. The Electoral College gets the last word.

Third, some argue that the Electoral College has good intentions, they support their claims with ideas stated in the passage ""In Defense of the Electoral College"" some such as ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance to large states, the Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal, or the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast."" Although these reasons may be valid, they're not enough to pursuade thousands of U.S citizens that the Electoral College should not be abolished.

Cat got your tongue? In conclusion, as you can see the Electoral College is not always the best way to choose a president, it is unfair, it is outdated since the founding fathers had set it up, and it is irrational. the Electoral College should be replaced with the process of popular vote.                            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F76DE2A94F49,"Dear Senator,

The electoral college is in fact not best form of electing the president of the United States of America. When using the electoral college for voting for president, voters are not really voting for the president. Instead, they are voting for a slate of electors who then elect the president. Voters can't always control who their electors vote for, so it is all in the hands of the chosen electors. The electors must be trusted to pick the choice that their people want, but we all know that not everyone is as trustworthy as we would like to believe. The electors could possibly vote for the party that was not wanted in the first place, which is a problem. This brings about many possible issues for the people of our country.

Having to vote for someone who then is being trusted to vote for who you would have rather voted for yourself is a huge issue. Not only could they vote for the wrong person instead of the one that you wanted, they could potentially bring the country great danger if they vote for someone who could bring about bad things to our beloved nation. The electors could always defy the will of the people.

We could save the time wasted having to vote for someone else who has the potential to vote against who we wanted to vote for by just having a direct vote for who we wanted to vote for. Having a direct vote would give the exact opinions straight from the people of the country, and there would be less arguing and hatred for who becomes the president. The whole country would be able to voice their own opinions instead of who they believe has the same opinion as them.

Having a popular vote instead of the electoral college process is a time saver, and helps the people of the country. It allows the people to vote for who they actually want directly, instead of voting for someone to then vote for the president that they want. It would give people a greater influence to vote, knowing that their own vote actually directly affects the outcome of the presidential election. It would potentially eliminate all of the electors, saving time, money, and a vote for the next president of the United States of America.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
0DBE82E9933F,"Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. I believe in keeping the Electoral College for many reasons.

The Electoral College is not a place but a process that was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Each candidate running for president in a state has their own group of electors. A presidential election is held every four years so we can help choose our state's electors because when we vote for our candidate we actually are voting for our candidate's electors. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office.

A single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. At a very basic level, electoral college is unfair to voters. Mainly becuase of the winner-take-all system in each state. It is proven that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational but I strongly disagree. It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote but it rarely happens. I have five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree.

One is Certainty of Outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. Second is Everyone's President. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count and that the new president will have no regard for their interests. Third is Swing States. The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in 2012's election. Fourth is Big States. The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. Fifth is Avoid Run-off Elections. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. An example is Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992. They both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.

These are many reason I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College.

On the issue of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote, I think it is both necessary and unnecessary to keep it the way even if it has been since the founding fathers established it in the Constitution many years ago. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. It only requries 270 of those votes to become the winner of the Electoral College. electorla college is good for the voting process by allowing the qulified people to vote for who they want in office. If we get rid of electoral college then we might not have as many well educated people voting for who gets put in office.

Even if we have the electoral college that dosnt always mean that we will for sure win the election. In 2000 Al Gore won the popular votes but did not win the presidency. There are just a few things that would maybe make the electoral college a little unfair. The state voters do not directly vote for the president, they vote for the electors, who in return vote for the president. State electors are chosen by,sometimes going to state conventions ,the state's party's committee, or even sometimes the presidential canditdates themselves. So with that being said it may be unfair to vote straight for electors and just vote for the president directly. Another thing that would make it unfair because of the ""winner takes all"" system in every state candidates them selves dont spend time in the states that they are repersenting.

What happens if there is a tie in the voting of the electors? In a case like that it would go to the house of repersentatives. If we do it by popular vote than we would not have to worry about there being a tie. People would be able to vote for who they wanted and that would be settled before it even started. If you think that a tie is not likely well in 1976 a tie would have happened if just a small number of votes, 5,559 would have just voted the other way. So saying that the electorla collage way of doing it has its upsides and its down sides. It is outdated and irrational.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
99F66A238A08,"Dear State Senator,

I think we should change our voting system. Electoral College has it's flaws. We know it's the traditional voting system. It has some unfair advantages. Allow me to explain and convice you to changing our voting system.

Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors could be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors will depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't always control whom thier electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfairto voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.

8F0EABC0599F,"Dear Senate , it is evident that many people think electoral voting is the wrong thing to do. I think that we sould use another method of voting like popular voting. I feel this way because the president that you might be voting for might win the popular vote but because he had lost the electoral vote he doesnt become president. I believe this is wrong because the president with the majority of vote by the U.S. should win, people should be able to decide who is president , and because I think its wrong to not give the U.S. citizens what they want.

Although electoral voting may seem good its not because you dont really vote for your president that you want your voting for a slate of elector that pick the president they would rather have . In ""Source 2:The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" it state that ""Under the electoralcollege system , voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president"" From this we can see that its shouldnt be like this because the people should be able to choose the president who they voted for. also in source 2 it states "" The single bets argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.

But their still wrong because electoral voting has caused many problem for us in the past and how dont we know it will not cause them in the future. that why we should change our way of voting.

62C1EF710A7C,"Having ""electors"" vote for us from the electoral college is basically giving us, the people, no say into what we president we want. Why ask us the people to vote when you have someone or others to chose what they think we want for president? Changing the from electoral college voting to the popular vote can give us the people a voice for what we want and think is best for this country and it gives us a reason to vote. If we still electoral college voting then our voice as a country is not being heard.

Giving us a voice in this country that we live in an enormous oppurtunity than what other countries around the world do not have the privelage to have. Giving us, the people, a voice brings us together as a country and it unifies us. It also means that not only do we have governent power but we have people power as a whole. Bradford Plumer from source 2 explains to us in his first subtitle what is wrong withe the electoral college and he startes that ""When you vote, you are not voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors, who then for the president of their choice."" That was an example of our people not having a voice because we are basically wasting our time voting because at the end of the day the slate of electors are the ones who end up chosing who they want as president. Why should we vote when our vote doesn't even matter?

Moreover, I feel that us voting is a waste of our time because of this winner-takes-all method that Bradford Plumer states in the fifth paragraph of his article titled: The Indefensible Electoral College. The winner-takes-all method is when presidents travel to specific states in which they believe they would win in the electoral votes and some states do not get visited at all by neither of the canidates because the canidates do not feel like they would win their votes. I understand that the electoral college is a process in which was founded by our founding fathers and established it into our constitution so that there is a compromise between election of the presodent by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Source 1). It is not really a compromise when you have a system in which a president can win the popular vote by 99 percent of the people but still lose by the electoral college because we basically have no say in the election.

On a final note, the electoral college system is a unfair way of our countries presidents to be elected when we also have the votes of the people which have no effect on which canidate wins. Although, our founding fathers thought this was a terrific idea at the time of making this part of the constitution, in reality we have a much larger population today than they did in the past when they had made the constitution. Having have all these people in our country vote today for a canidate and later have the vote not take any effect which canidate should win is very unfair. I can understand the electoral college system working back then when it was first made because the population was still relatively minimal but now we must abolish it because the points that some electoral vote colleges get is very small compared to some other states. How would you feel if you were a canidate and got 99.9 percent of the votes and still lost?    ",5,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Its unfair because states like Texas the people who they vote for always gets an edge in elections and small states like Mississippi gets small parts in voting.

9EF555637FBC,"Dear Senator Rick Scott,

I am writing to you today in regaurds to the Electoral College and whether or not we should continue to use it in our presidential election.

As you know, the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers when they wrote the Constitutation. They established it as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and an election by popular vote of qualified citizens. I feel that we should get rid of the Electoral College and have a direct election by qualified United States citizens.

One reason that I feel the United States should get rid of the Electoral College is because Congress can be easily swayed to vote a certain way in the election. One example of this would be because of lobbying. This process is where someone persuades a person to vote a certain way by bribing them with campaign funds or other monetary things. Where some may argue that the Congress should have a say in the election because they are chosen to be leaders in their states, I feel that because of some of the people that are allowed to be elected into Congress, the United States should leave it up to the rest of the population to elect the president.

Another reason I feel this way is that through the electoral college, the population of a state votes on an elector who in turn elects the president. This is not fair because if you are a republican, you do not want the democratic president to win the popular vote. This means that if you are in a mostly democratic state, the elector for the state that you live in will most likely choose the democratic president that you voted against just because that is what some of the other people in your state wanted. This would be the same for a democrat living in a mostly republican state.

It is because of these reasons that it is in my humble opinion that the United States should get rid of the Electoral Congress and have a direct vote of qualified citizens.

391455AC0C39,"The Electoral College is a really good process that I think they should keep. This Electoral college was found by the founding fathers and it is used so that the citizens could vote and the congress. The citizens get to have the right to vote on who they want to be presidant. After everyone voted the votes are counted up in each state and it shows which states voted for different people. The congress have a meeting of the electors and get to all vote. All votes for the congress are counted out seperatly then citizens. This is a the start of why I think Electoral College is fair and equal all around.

In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber. When voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors. After voting in the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment,"" which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records.

There are mainly 5 reasons in why the Electoral College should stay. First is the Certainty of Outcome which shows that there cant be a dispute because it is based on popular vote. The next reason is Everyone is Presidant, this means that the presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. Another reason is Swing Sates which is the winner take all method. They are usually whatching campaigns and really listen to the other candidates, thoses poeple are usually thoughtfull voters. The next great reason is Big States, this shows if you win a big state then you win more electoral votes and each big state has more electoral votes. The last reason is Avoid Run Off Elections, this avoids the problem of no candidates recieves a majority of the votes in the east.

Their are alot of great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings to. Voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote, they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant. This can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the 30 or so congress people voting for presidant. What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters.

After reading the article and going over it I believe that the Electoral College is a great idea. There are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it. Not everything can be perfect but the Electoral College is trying to get that way. The presidant is still getting voted every 4 years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time. Those were all my reasons on why I thought the Electoral College is the right way to go.            ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
E5909247F839,"Dear state senator,

I ask you  to change the voting methods to popular vote instaed of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes; focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the resultof them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates al all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campain as. ""You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like Califoprnia that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the precidency and its a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slater of elctors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for precident he was not the most popular in the natuion and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the

President""  by Richard A. Posner there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting methed to The Popular voting to elect The President Of The United states Of America  because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.                           ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
65E9951C2D75,"What is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process ,not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections  of the President  by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. In the United States people select a president every three years. They would either select their president  by Electoral College, or by the most popular vote.

Voting by Electoral College is not safe at all,they should change it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. When you vote by elecoral vote it is never guaranteed that they are going to vote for who you wanted to  vote for. They might even change their mind at the last second ,so you never know what they are about to do. Some rich people can pay them to buy off their votes. Then ,boom you lost a vote  it might result to a tie or lost. According to paragraph 11 ""In the same vein,''faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast and deciding vote for whomeverthey please..."". You never what  could happen ,it is like taking a very riskfull risk and every votes matter .Just one vote can make a very big difference. Further more,voting by popular vote would give you a better chance of getting your candidate to win .When you are the one that elects the President you feel more confident and good .You'll know that you voted for the one you wanted to win and the one that you think that will change everything the way you wanted to. Also ,you don't have worry about anything else ,like people going in the voting box and taking the votes  out. Once you vote ,your vote is immediately safe.

In the other hand,voting by Electoral College  benefited us .Obama which is the current president of the United States wouldn't probably be president if it wasn't for them. Accordind to the last article ""In [2012's ] election ,for example ,Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney....'' That means their votes helped Obama win. Also' the Electoral College avoids problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast. Winners take all methods in awarding electoral votes for what they've done.

To summarise my reasonnings  Electoral College votes should be change to election by  popular vote  for the president of the United States. Peoples should be allowed to vote on their own. Everybody would be much happier .Without happy people the country would be upside down.

I feel that electoral college should stay becuase it set's straight the manege for the peoples votes for the president. Even thow if a tie the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives were they decide on the new president. The electoral college is a process its not a place. It shows that the founding fathers established it for the compromise between elections between the president by a vote in congress. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. Plus a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president .It say's in the passage that under the 23rd Amendment of the constiton that the district of colombia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purposes of electoral college. On many cases 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. The electoral college system states that voters vote not for the president,but for a state of eletors who elect the president. I think that they should have the right to elect the president that would make this nation grow stonger not to make mistakes and lead us to problems which they can decide to choose the future of the united states. Many people have diffrent opinions as me but not all will get the same results as they wanted. The effects of the electoral college has been giving us positive values. As we live on since back of the elections day we are still here becuase of thow,s elections it made us who we are american citizions of the USA.History depends on the future rights of the president thats why the electoral college is there to help make that happen.

92F0F8391870,"Having an electoral college is a controversial topic. There are many different views on whether electoral college should be allowed or removed. Keeping the Electoral College does of couse have its benefits, but so does changing to elecction by popular vote. On a personal opinion, taking out Electoral College has more positives then negatives. When taking out Electoral College, citizens of this country actually have a say in the president they choose and it will become less complicated and less confusing for voters.

Removing Electoral College and replacing it with election by popular vote is greatly convenient. Citizens in the US right now do not have a say in the president they want to win. Instead of voting for the president they are actually voting for a ""slate of electors"" according to Source 2 by Bradford Plumer. Electoral College does not represent a democracy which is what this country is all about. This country gives the individuals a right to say and express themselves. When a 4 year term is over and it is time to vote again, the citizens are voting for a group of people, not the actual president. Then, those group of people called electors later vote for the president they would like. Even though in Source 3 is states "" But each party selects a slate of electors truested to vote for the partys nominee (and that trust is barely betrayed) is is entirely possible for the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" Meaning the electoral college can still vote for another president even if it not the party's nominee. It is the electors who choose the president not the people.

Furthermore, selecting president by popular votes contains more benefits. Many people become confused when it comes to voting. They do not fully understand the concept of the Electoral College and therefore make mistakes when it comes to voting. In source 2, it clearly states "" Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" Thus meaning that people are not clear on the situation and end up making a mistake that may or may not have have changed the outcome of that election. Even though the college restores the politicaql balance between large and small states and has it's good sides to it, removing the Electoral college will be more bemeficial at the end of the day.

All in all, Electoral College should be removed and reoplaced. It will be better. Having people clear on who they vote for and actually having a say in who they want to win president will actually show this countries democratic views and will relieve probably a big chunk of Americas citizens.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
284BD4B2892B,"Dear

State Senator ,

I think the Electoral College would make voting harder. The Electoral College is unfair and votes on its own favor rather than what the people of America think. The reason is because Americans (

voters

) are not voting for their president, but for a slate of electors, who then turn and elect their president. Its a bit overruled that by declaring candidate with most popluar votes winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in the modern sense...it is electors who elect the president,not the people. The Electoral College does not let the majority of candidates votes cast making a difference in voting. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the prsident turned off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The Electoral College Method is from the past its not made for the modern day voting system, it makes voters not want to vote for there freedom or president its not made for present day voting    ",2,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
5FBEBF4F7E1D,"Dear Senator of Florida,

Recently I have begun to research the difference in effect on the people of Ameirca, between the Electoral College and the result of popular cote for President. I have found out that our founding fathers created the Electoral College in the Constitution, so that while the votes between Congress and the people may be different, ther could be a compromise. Our country; well our world, is evolving with the changes in generation. 2015 has come upon us, and with this year brings a whole new change in cutural diversity and tehcnology. So while I believe sticking to our coutry's Constitution is vital for some reasons, I also believe it is outdated in others.

Today, people are slowly coming out of the shells of the past and embracing the change of the future. Every year, children grow older, new children are born, and people pass away from our fine Earth. Though this new generation we have built is going to, one day, become the generation that decides who leads our country and who doesn't. I believe that the Electoral College puts a restraint on the freedom our people, new and old, should possess. Our people have to vote for a party, a group of people that don't show either their faces or their true personalities, to trust well enough with their vote to go for the President they think is right for the Country. Although that is very rarely ever betrayed- as noted by my recent research -I do believe that it is against our certain rights as a United States citizen not to know who exactly we are putting our faith in. Also, even if we do put our full faith in these mysterious political parties, like we have for years and years, who's to say that our vote will even matter? Al Gore, in the year 2000, had more popular votes from the people than Bush, yet he received fewer electoral votes, which decided the winner of the election. Why have us put in our vote at all, if it means nothing to 538 politicians?

Our country is made up of millions, upon millions of strong women, men, and children and they should be the deciding factor in the  elections. It's our country just as much as it is the men that make up the Electoral College. A requirement of 270 electoral votes must be made in favor for one presidential candidate over the, though why should such a small number mean more against the millions from the citizens of this great country, the same people that make up the great state of Florida.

I understand the need for the Electoral College, when it comes to some decisions. Like avoiding a national catastrophe when it comes to the nuber of swing-votes. While I am a woman of passion, I do allow myself to see both sides of the story and I think while the Electoral College can do good, it can also do bad for this country. It is outdated, overused, and wrong.

Our founding fathers built the Constitution and this country we call home, and while that is a great thing...times are changing and the power of the House, and the Senate, should now be moved on to the people. Some states, like North Carolina and Rhode Island were even unable to know close to anything about the current eection between Gore and Bush in 200. I say every state deserves to know the news circling around their country and how it may affect them. The power should now be given to the people, allow them to decide and make decisions. Let the people know they are heard, they have the freedom that our founding fathers gave them in the Constitution. They can speak and let their minds roam for the good of this country.

The Electoral College should be taken down and gicen too the hands of the people, for the good of our future.

Sincerely,

A woman who cares both for her state and her country.

9EF63FBC32F7,"Dear Florida state senator,

I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. I argue for keeping the Electoral College because of several reasons backed up with information.

Firstly, I'd like to point out that the Electoral College makes it so that larger states don't have larger influence than smaller states. If the Electoral College is removed then larger states shall have much more political power than smaller states. Which means that a small state might not get the same amount of attention from presidential candidates as a larger state would like Florida.

Secondly, the Electoral College avoids Run-off Elections in which no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It avoids that problem because candidates can win Presidency by electoral votes instead of popularity vote. For example, Nixon and Clinton didn't have the majority of the popular votes, but they still won because of electoral votes. If the Electoral College hadn't exist then elections might be more frustrating for everyone, because the Electoral College makes a certainty of outcome.

Thirdly, the Electoral College makes sure that a presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. This is good because a candidate with only regional appeal is probably not going to be a very good president. And besides without the Electoral College there would be many presidents with regional appeal wich would make other states feel left out, and this could be catastrophic to the unity of America.

In conlcusion, despite the Electoral College isn't exactly of democratic origins, it still equalizes the political power of states, makes sure that candidates have trans-regional appeal and avoids run-off elections. Overall I say that the Electoral College is very important in keeping how we choose our president balanced and smooth.                                                                                            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
F37464EF4C66,"What is The Electoral College? It is a process the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified cirizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors. Most states use a ''winner-take-all'' method that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The Electoral College is the method we use for voting and selecting our president's.

Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Therefore I think that we should change to a popular vote. Over 50 percent of the people agreee, and I think that should be enough proof. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.

The problem with the electoral college is that you voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, wwho in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate. The slate containing 34 Democratic electors pleged to Kerry. Most likely those voters would probably win the election because Texas is a big state and a high percentage of the people voted Kerry.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. Just as Romney was a solid regional in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states. This causes the method to be difficult to chose a for sure winner. Usually elections are always close.

The Electoral College restores some of that weight in the pollitical balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The method may turn off potential voters. Especially for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas and Republicans in California. I think that we should changeb to a popular vote method. Either way, people should be encouraged to vote because every vote counts.    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
9562D07129D8,"THere has been quite a lot of recent talk of which the national government should keep the Electoral COllege, or change to an election by popular vote for the president of the UNited states. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress""(Source 1: What is the Electoral College? by the office of the federal register). IT has been established by the founding fathers to make a compromise between popular vote and election vote in congress. Popular representation is a vote for qualified citizens to take an individual vote cast to the state which then is transfered to a representative whole. Thre are many good effects this popular representation has on the country, but the Denator should keep the Electoral College without a shout of a doubt.

one of the most important reasons we should keep the electoral college process is that in this process, states pay much more attention to the electors due to having swing states. the people who decide on our president should be most intrigued and the most concerning ones. ""Voteres in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign - to really listen to the competeing candidates- knwing htat theu are going to decide the election(in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president, by richard a. posner, subtitle Swing States)"".  MAny voters that are in swing states, which are stated that cast the majority of votes in the system with higher amounts of population, therefore congress representatives.

another reason why the gov shouyld keep the elctoral college is because  it resorts unwanted balance.  ""there is no pressure for run-off elections when no candidtate wins a mojority of the votes casy; that pressuire mwhich would greatly cvomplicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner"" so what this quote from the passage is saying is that no candidate recieves a majority if the votes cast, due to each states fair rep of the population without being overwhlemded by the most populated states such as florida, california, and trexas. While you may believe that the popular representaion vote may be overwhelmingkly more accurate to the people wants , you are wrong. the electoral college is a processs in whic hgives the people wants in a state to an elector who then gives yiou an equal chance onf voting for what youo pleased. he may be the ""biggest"" or ""smallest"" amount of electoral votes, but as a state in a whole yu may recieve a big surprise that there is no clear winner as each [president may not be just familiat with one region such as the north east, or the southwest, etc.

so as you can see, the government should keep an electoral colllge process instead of the popular representation vote. it would be greatly appreciated to the United States People who may be under informed of how grest an oppurtunity for an idea such as this to vome up, or they might be over informed of fallicy iinformatio  of our election process now. either way, theyu should know what a great process this is    ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

The government has made two types of ways to vote, Electoral College and popular vote. I believe that we should go with the popular vote method. When voting like this its not a confusing, Theres no missing ad campaigns, and in the winner take all you dont rule out another persons elector for his chose.

Using popular vote for electing our president is better then Electoral College i believe because its not that confusing. In Electoral College you vote for a wet number of electors and they give their own vote on their behalf. Now with popular vote say one state votes for president b rather then president a then the state votes for president b.

In ppular vote both presidents are trying to win you over so they will make a campaign. what if you never see the campaign? This is what can happen in the Electoral College method. If a president knows that a certain state will not vote for them then the president wont perade around there. Therefore the state cant make a correct decision.

The popular vote method is very diffrent as you have seen in the paragraphs above. One reason I prefer the popular vote method over the Electoral College is do to the winner take all in ruling out the electors that didnt vote for the president. So if theopposing pesident winns the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and i dont believe thats fair.

So when it comes to election day which method will you chose?

ED46683FC1E4,"The Electoral College is a place. In the passage, they are deciding wether or not to abolish the Electoral College. It was originally made as a compromise in the election process for a new president.

Based on the information given in this passage, the Electoral College should be kept. It makes it easier to decide on a new president. The normal citizens vote for who they want, then those vote go to the electors. Those electors then vote for who they think should be president. If the Electoral College is abolished, then it would become way more diificult to decide on a new president .

Although over sixty percent of citizens want a direct vote, it still has its upsides. For example, the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. Each state selects a group of their own voters to decide on the next president. Using the Electoral College, this is a certainty of outcome.

A7EA8CF2F203,"In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1) I believe strongly that we should keep the electoral college, beacuse it keeps people from directly voting for a presdient,keeps everything even and mostlikely fair. Most people think that we should get rid of the electoral college,its clearly a state of opinion.

When you really sit down and think about how most people vote in the Northeast and South they are not the thoughtful voters. (said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what he  stood for but most didn't.

In reality most people think that the voting is unfair, like what happened with Presidnet Kennedy. Kennedy was the stronger, better canidate to be president. I believe that the electors chose right, it may not have been who the people wanted. He was way better then Nixon could ever be. That may have made the people very mad,which led to the assination of President Kennedy. Kenndey changed the country and to this day in my mind, known as one of the best presdidents we ever had. Thanks to the electoral system we had Kennedy elected instead of Nixon,could you just imagine how the country would be today. If Kennedy didnt win,or if Nixon was president just one little thing could change everything. Everything happens for a reason and having the electoral college helps. I know that Nixon has the popular vote but kennedy needed to win for the better of our country,its my state of opinion.

Most people think that having the electoral college is bad,why? because they believe that the people should be able to vote directly. I understand how and why they believe that. When you think about votin directly it would insure the people that whoever they are voting for they would be sure to get thier votes and for sure get the president that they wished to be president. I could truley undertsand why and this would work out, but i still strongly believe that this could be the cause to many problems.

In conclusion,I beleive that we shoudl keep the electoral college becaue he keeps the people for choosing a president direlcetly. If they make a bad chose someone,who knows is the better canidate that they could over rule the peoples vote. So it would all fair in most turns and would possibably helping the country,and many people believe otherwise its truely a state of opinion. You choose who chooses the president.

To begin with, you've probably herd the term democracy since thats what our government is  right ? well that word comes from the latin words demo & kratia meaning people rule . Popular vote would be better than the electoral college because then peoples voices can truly be heard, no scams, no funny buisness, just old fashion voting. Popular vote is also an easier and much more simple system than the electoral college. with popular vote all you do is look at the polls and see who has more votes as apposed to counting each and every states electoral points until you get 273.

In addition, if popular vote is put into action then it would inspire more people to vote, some citizens are very skeptical about the electoral collage but with popular vote the facts are in the polls. According to "" The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plumer The electoral college is infair, outdated, and irrational.

CBC776495BE0,"Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote because the electoral college is outdated and ruins the American freedom.

The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur. This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world. Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 ""Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency.""  If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose?

Another factor to this problem is the American freedom. The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.

While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states, it's a one-sided deal. It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president?

All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy.

I understand there has been some contreversy between keeping or changing the Electoral College by popular vote for the president of the United States, But We need to Keep the Electoral College, and these are the reasons why.

First things first, the Electoral College is a process,not a place. Also it consists of 538 electors but a majority of electoral votes needs to be 270 votes in order to elect a president. So each Canident has a 50/50 chance of winning or losing. The elctors are chosen by the political parties, which i can see how people would have a problem with that,but if they dodnt choose the canadents for us we probably would even know which person to elect as a canadent.

The presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, giving the citizens more than enough time to decide if they are happy with the president they have or if they should elect a new one, usually there happy with the president they elected which means that the Electoral College process is working.

Although the electorla college system is for the voters to vote for a slate of electors to elect the president the citizens still get a say in the election towards there president of choice. if the citizens could just elect a president from there personal votes then they would probably make the wrong decsion on who to choose, they might be fooled by the flashy ads on tv promising change when in reality, there promises are lies. Thats why having a slate of electors help to vote for a president if so important because they know how to point out there lies and know what there true intentions are.

Some say that the Electoral College system is 'Unfair' to the people but i strongly disagree. Infact, the Electoral College helper the people choose the right president for our country    ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
CCF1C548FD56,"One big thing i want to happen is that the electoral college for voting should be changed for popular vote for the prsident because i think that if you change it voting would go a lot easier than it do now. Why? because the electoral college is a more complicated voting matter that people often do and get their votes mixed up and  it takes more effort and time just to vote rather than a easy popular vote that people can measure off a chart or graph to see with person should get elected.

Another thing about the voting process i think i shoul'd talk about is some of the possible problems you can come across after this change in the voting process. there's one thing thats possible of happening is that a lot of people might nor agree with changing the voting process because they dont want to learn a new one because they are so used to the one they already doing. Another one is that poeple might think things would go more worse if someone mad a change because of they way the votes are coming in and if you voting on a behalf of a friend and send the vote to the wrong person and the other person lost by 1 vote when you didn't mean to send that, they should have a computer system that you use that makes sure you really want to vote on that person.

It is another major thing about voting that needs to be discuss. when all these thousands of people vote they votes should actually count not just have people vote and then the only votes that count is the people in some court room that have more business people come in to vote and only there's count. But i think people waist a lot of their time with the electoral college because of how it works and the way peopple send their votes and who the votes actually going to.

The winner of the election is the most important one because he is the main focu now because his votes were more popular of just alot more than the other person, but thats what i want to talk about. even though the winner won he still have to pay attention to the other candidates but they should have a system that protects the winner files and have people haves a good watch on the people who is elected to see what their background life is like their history and what they do everyday to make sure that person isn't trying no horrible plan for something.

23F6EB35E138,"The Electoral College is a process in which electors pick the president instead of the people, but is it worth keeping. No, the Electoral College is not worth keeping because it reflects the view of the electors instead of  the people.

Some people would argue that the Electoral college should be kept because it ensures the certaintity of the outcome ( source 3 paragoh 18). However this relies on a winner takes all system which makes the say of the minority voters pointless since even if they do vote then their vote is pointless. Second of all the presidents only campaign in states they are not sure of and completly ignore the states they know they will win (source 3 paragraph 19). This may be a good strategy but if we instead abolished the Electoral College then everyones vote would matter and the canditate would have to campaign in every state to ensure his victory. In all the Electoral College should be abolished becasue it takes away say of the people.

Not only does the Electoral college take away the say of the people, it also has no protection against a tie of states that have an even number of electors (source 2 paragraph 11). For instance a state like hawaii that has a total of two electors if they both vote for differnt people then how are the votes decided well it already happened in 1960,but Richard Nixon who was the vice president at the time and known to be against the Electoral College decided to only aknowledge his opponents electors. That is why we should abolish the Electoral College.

Allow me ask a hypothetical question what if the electors were corrupt and voted for whomever they pleased without even considring the peoples vote (source 1 paragrqaph 2). We have no system to ensure that the people vote matters but the electors does therefore electors that are picked by former canditates may be more likely to return the favor and ignore the peoples vote and vote for their canditate. There are many important figures whom are against the Electoral College such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter,  and Bob Dale there are many more but thes are all politicians who see the Electoral College the same way the people do (source 2 paragraph).

In all the Electoral college should be abolished because it ignores the peoples votes. The votes that werre granted to the people by the constitution therefore the Electoral College not only doesn't care about the people, but it is also violating their constitutional rights.            ",4,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent
850201A9689E,"The electoral college is our countries way of voting, but we need to change that and what i mean by that is that i think we need to have our voting system on the peoples popular vote, for many reasons first off, easy to comprehend you dont have to be nervous and accedently vote on someone different you can obviously see who your voting on. secondly, president can win just by popular vote and not worry about the electoral college votes.

To start off, the electoral college is confusing when i first learned about it i could barely understand, but when your voting on a president you dont have to worry about voting on the wrong person because you vote and your states vote is different. also when you vote by poular vote you chboose who you want to be president and not worrying about your states vote. also theyr'e aren't any hassels involved like understanding how the electoral college works. also the vote that you cast can not be who you wanted due to the elctoral college because you cast a vote on the electors and they vote which isn't fair to the people because they could vote for someone toltally different then what you wanted.

In addition, the nominees for president now can get popular vote and still loose which isn't fair to the people and the nominee because he can get tricked and the people do to which is cruel. also if if i was a nominee i would wrather win by a popular vote becacuse it means the people get to vote for who they wanted instead of a elector and it means the people really wanted me as a president so it shows that they wanted me and that i win by there election vote. now instead of that we have a system to where i could be running and get popular vote and loose which is cruel and unright to the people cause it means they wanted me.

To conclude, the elctoral college is our countries way of voting but i would wrather have the president win by popular vote because first, easy to comprehend and you get who you wanted to vote for. secondly, you dont have to worry about winning popular vote then loose cause you didn't win electoral vote.         ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

04DEFB0B11C5,"The united states has this ellection system called the electoral collage. The electoral collage is a system of voting for verious comities. When the founding fathers of The united states made the constitution the electoral collage was a part of it.

Why would any one want to change the electoral collage because i would like to know. In my oppinion in is the best thing i know of for a working government. Over the years there has been a larg number of amendments to the constitution, but that was to adjust it to the chang in todays tecnology. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage.

The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a ""winner-take -all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat.

Everything that is rong with the electoral collage. Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry.    ",1,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Throughout the years people have lost their lives due to the use of their cellular phones. Using phones while driving could be dangerous for everyone that's on the road 24/7. Innocent people that go to work a drive every day put their lives at risk for other people that drive while using their phones. Phones should not be used while driving.

People that use their phones while driving put their lives at risk for the simple fact that they could cause an accident on the highway or even in the streets. People choose the wrong moment while driving to look at their phones and sometimes forget that they share the road with other innocent people and they turn what could simply be a normal day to a tragic ending on a person's life. Phones haven't been out for that long and we as humans can get so distracted by just looking down at your phone and not being aware of the cars around you or in front of you. Every year more people die for causing an accident while using their phone or is killed by a person thats on their phone when not supposed to.

In the U.S., 4637 people died in car crashes in 2018 due to cell phone use. Including the cost of people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion dollars. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 millions crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving , these mortality death rates are from every country that people are able to have a phone. One out of four cars accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. however , the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car accidents. On average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to people that are distracted by their phones while driving.

Ways that we can prevent accidents of people using their phones while driving is that people should put their phone on silent or out of reach. People should be able to use their phone if they are going to a certain location and they need to use their GPS. car accidents are mostly caused by the fact that nowadays teenagers have the privilege of driving around with innocent people that go to work to bring food to the table. Most teenagers know the risks that their lives could be at risk while driving. According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyways. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accident were distracted by their cell phones.

I say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life.

If you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.    ",2,Phones and driving,Independent
4F0E197053FF,"Drivers Should Be Limited As To When They Can Use Their Phones While Driving

Drivers who are distracted by their phone while driving have an increased risk of crashing. Crashes affect both the crasher and any possible crashing victims. Everything from physical pain to emotional pain as well as financial pain can be felt after a crash. 3,287 deaths happen every day due to fatal car crashes. On average, 9 of these fatalities are related to distracted driving. Due to the inability to test if a crash was due to distracted driving, it is believed that the recorded number of distracted driving incidents is greatly under-recorded.

Over 80% of drivers admit to not paying attention to the road while they are doing blatantly hazardous behaviors while driving. The listed activities are not always the driver interacting with their phone, however it is safe to assume that interacting with their phone is one of the many hazardous activities these drivers admitted to doing. Distracted driving is now considered to be the ""new drunk driving"" since it follows the same psychological pattern. With recent studies of phone addiction showing some of the same signs as drug addiction, people are having a harder time ignoring their phone. It is no coincidence that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.s and that 16-19 year olds have a three times higher chance to be involved in a fatal crash than any other age group while studies show that teens and younger children are the most addicted to their phones.

While it is dangerous to be interacting with your phone while driving some people have no choice in the matter. Reasons for this can range from work related texts or phone calls to family matters. Some states are trying what is called a ""hands free law"" that makes it illegal for a driver to hold their phone while they are driving. It also states that a driver cannot read or watch videos on their phone while driving. Because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages. The law along with the accessories allow these types of drivers to access their phones, though very limited, and keep up to date with their important concerns.

The hands free law and the accessories could make the open roads a little safer for everybody while allowing people to keep their phones in their car but it is important to remember that no matter how many laws are put into place, people will still continue to abuse them and accadences will still happen. It comes down to the individual and how properly educated they are and whether or not they can mentaly handle a responsibility like driving.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Look around you! All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.

Phones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. ""About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year"" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article ""Mobile phones and driving safety"", it stated that,""In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving."" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.

Many people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of "" Teen driver source"", ""In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.""The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on ""Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.

Both the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.

Each state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.

In conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.       ",6,Phones and driving,Independent

Most humans have that habit of attending to their phone when they receive a notification while driving. They are so anxious to know what's going on right there at that moment. But they have no idea of how much danger they are putting themselves & others in! Using a phone while driving can wait. Here's why!

First, you can't multitask & pay attention to both a phone & the road at the same time. If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps.

Second, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So therefore, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that.

Lastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence. Just think about it.

Those are my reasonings for advocating that phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle. It's a high risk & dangerous. But hey, it's just my opinion!   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Losing your life over having a cellphone in your hand or trying to respond to a text that can wait is not worth your life. It is not that serious to ruin someone else's life and yours to send a text back to your homeboy saying your on the way. Stop signs maybe but while driving of course not.

Using your cell phone on the road is nothing to play with. Driving without a phone in your hand is hard enough. You have to focus on your surroundings and other people driving is hard enough. I think I can speak for everyone when I say stuff can happen right before your eyes. That means as soon as you look down to send a text back to your girlfriend you can be in a ditch or through a building as soon as you look up.

Moving on, I feel like people should not be able to have their phones active while driving. And music should not be played loud enough to where they can't hear the outside world. Personally I don't like how people do that. It is dangerous to others and themselves. But more phone laws should be introduced because that is way too many deaths to be comfortable with.

In my opinion, while you are driving you should not be able to use your phone. You are putting your life in danger as well as others. Phones are a big distraction while driving and if you don't have some type of bluetooth system in your car then you should not be on it. Cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands.

Holding a cell phone to your ear, or having your eyes diverted from the road by logic and common sense the driver is distracted. If an emergency maneuver or emergency braking is needed a driver has a second to react, and a split second to execute the appropriate maneuver to avoid a collision. Picture doing this with a cell phone in your hand. Those who are caught will be issued a ticket by a police officer who will probably be quite perturbed at the driver's ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident. A text message that reads ""ok"" isn't worth a couple hundred dollar fine.

However, people shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

In the society of today, everyone is easily distracted when they get a notification on their phones. Which can lead to some funny stuff like running into a pole or a wall. But it can also lead to the end of someone's life.

The average person drives 70 mph on the highway, and if a person were to look away for 5 seconds they would have traveled 102.7 feet. That is more than a quarter of a football field. By that time anything could've happened that would lead them to an accident. Each year, over 390,000 accidents caused by texting and driving leads to severe injuries such as broken bones, neck and back injuries, traumatic brain injuries, etc. For example, in 2013 a 22 year-old man named Alexander Heit flipped his car and rolled for a while. He died while typing a text to his friend.

Because of all the deaths and injuries caused by texting while driving, most states in the United States have made laws to try to make the road a safer place. The first offense you will be charged with a misdemeanor and can get a ticket that ranges from $25 to $50 and one on their driver license. And it just gets worse from there on out if they continue violating the law. But if you were to kill someone while texting and driving, you will be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter and can spend up to 20 years in prison. Although all of these precautions have been made, accidents are still growing.

The states of Missouri and Montana do not have laws to regulate texting while driving even after all of the accidents caused by it. I honestly think that there should be harsher laws for people texting while driving. It so saddening to hear that someone lost their life over a text that could have waited till later.

Texting while driving is even more dangerous than driving while under the influence of alcohol. People should put their devices down and focus on the roads and surrounding cars.

This causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. They do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. They also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. All these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone.

In America 28% of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. This is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. This is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. Motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non-distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied.

In 2019 most cars on the road have a hands-free devise built in to the car. This helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. A lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash.

A lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. You will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. I am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. People need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones.

In conclusion I believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. Using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. There are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands-free systems. And finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone.

Phones are a key part of our life, we use it for everything we need but some people can't be away from their phone for a minute and that can be a problem if there driving people. They could get in a car cash a severely injure someone and also put there life at risk or maybe even kill someone. As long as that person is responsible and can pay attention to the road while on their phone it shouldn't be a problem.

What if there's something really important that you need to handle on your phone and your on the road you can drive and handle your business at the same time instead of waiting until later where you might forget about it later and what if you get a phone call or a text from someone and its important and you can't answer or text them later.

These are some of the reasons I think people should be allowed to you use their phones while driving and some of the reasons and risk of using your phone while driving. I don't think it should be illegal because that's too much because you never know what people got going on these days.

The young adults had got to the point that they have to respond back to a text or a call, that they need to learn that a long-awaited response from a text or call does not mean rejection all of the time. The average time people eyes are off the road while texting and driving is a total of 5 whole seconds. In just one second, something could happen. Distracted driving is incredibly dangerous.

Driving while using cell phones is a problem that everyone has and need to learn how to adjust that. This requires adults and young adults to be aware to be safe while driving and not use their phone while driving. So adults and young adults, be aware to use your time wisely because that one look at your phone could end up being your last..      ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

My opinion is that they should not be able to use cell phones in any situation while operating a vehicle. I think this for multiple reasons such as they can get into an accident, they could harm someone else, and they could easily take a life out of this world.

My first reason why I think they should not be allowed to use cell phones is because it could lead to a car accident with someone else. For example, on the News 24 website the driving states this, """"I was trying to get my phone on the bed behind me. It was ringing. I did this while I was driving. I'm sorry about this I should have stopped the truck."" This shows that many people don't think about their surroundings within the reality and rather have their phones.

My second reason why is because they could harm someone else. It is proven that nearly 390,00 injuries happen during accidents that involve the use of cell phones. For example, an article on livestrong. com states , ""traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for American teens, and when it comes to distracted driving, young people are among the most likely to text and talk behind the wheel."" This proves that many accidents harm other people when the collision happens or within the next few days after the collision.

While some may say they need it for if their family is having an emergency and they had to make a quick phone call, you should still need to think about others and your surroundings and not just yourself.

Today, many states within the United States are making it a law to drive with a phone in your hand and can take you to court and write you a ticket for driving with a phone in your hand. Do you want to be in an accident with someone who was on their phone?             ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

In the United States the number one cause of motor accidents are distracted drivers, evidently these are people who text and drive. People know this fact yet accidents due to distraction on ones cell phone still arise in todays generation. Some people think that they are a experienced enough driver to be able to get on their phones and send a text, search the web, or make a phone call. However, studies have shown that it is impossible to focus on two things at once. In the United States 1 out of every 4 car crashes are due to texting and driving.

The National Safety Council reports that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". These statistics are frightening and eye opening to those incompetents enough to believe that they have the ability to text and drive safely. These victims are actually not experienced drivers but are mostly novice drivers. Police reports most of the accidents are caused by young adults. According to a AAA poll ""94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driver, but 35 percent admitted to doing it anyways."" Their young arrogance puts their lives at risk and states like Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, and other states outlawed texting and driving.

The risk that people of any age take when they text and drive is far too great and the laws set in place by those states are meant to protect us like any law should. People might not only hurt themselves, but they can hurt someone else who has loved ones. In conclusion, the final text to a loved one, boss, or friend should not be the last message of your life.

5E00448C4088,"Texting and driving has been a growing problem for years now. People should not be allowed to use cellular devices and drive at the same time. 3,637 people died in 2018 alone due to phone related car crashes. 15,341 drivers aged 15-29 were involved in fatal crashes due to distraction or cell phone use. Driving in itself is already dangerous and risky but then you put the additional risk of unneeded distractions it makes it more dangerous.

3,637 people died in 2018 alone because of phone related accidents.

Believe it or not this is one of the lowest recorded numbers in recent history. The National Safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. 1 out of 4 crashes in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Cell phone uses behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving 37 percent.

It's not just teens who text and drive. Adults are just as likely to text message while driving as teenagers.

More than a quarter of U.S adults admit to texting while behind the wheel. At any age, texting and operating a motor vehicle has been found to dramatically increase the chances of an accident. Adults 18-33 are the most likely to admit they text while they drive (59 percent) compared with age groups 34-45 (50 percent) and 46-64 (29 percent).

DE01C3FDCA0A,"Driving while operating your phone can end in a very horrific way and has for a number of young adults. The number one killer of young adults is motor vehicle crashes. This is a major issue in the United States and it is shown because a law was made to prevent operating a phone and driving. For example, there are billboards everywhere saying no texting and driving and commercials saying the same. Texting and driving may seem tempting to do, but every year thousands of drivers and passengers are killed due to someone being on their phone and driving. It only takes a couple of seconds for you to take your eyes off the road and someone can swerve in your lane or you swerve in someone else's lane and didn't notice because you are texting someone back or looking at a notification. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away.

First, ask yourself if the text or notification you received is more important than your life or than the people on the road with you. If not, put down the phone and wait until you are at a light or until you get to your destination. No notifications are worth someone's life or yours. You can look at the news or on the internet and see just how many young adults' lives are cut short because they wanted to text someone back or make a snap, all of that can wait. Seeing the statistics, the death rates, even some people's friends dead because they couldn't wait to text someone back or make a snap. Just because you got away with it once doesn't mean you should keep trying to do it because all it takes is a couple seconds and then you or someone else is hurt or dead.

Secondly, ""In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists."" All these deaths could have been avoided if the person could have just waited until they stopped or until they got to their destination. Your parents tell you to text or call before you start driving for a reason so they won't lose their child or see their child hurt. ""Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent."" So this shows that texting can make you forget important things you are supposed to do before or while driving.

Lastly, ""Typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles."" This shows that the couple of seconds you take to text or look at your phone can take away the attention you are required to have on the road to ensure safety. Texting while driving could make you miss that there is construction going on, someone is walking, or etc. Parents should not call while their children are driving, they should call before or after they arrive at their destination. If their child is called he is going to look at their phone and some might answer, but all it could take is a look and boom the car goes into another lane or they hit someone or another car.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away. No notification is worth someone's life. You can easily take someone's life young or old by a simple text. Before you start driving, call and text everyone that needs to be called or texted and if they call or text wait until you stop or get to your destination.

Should people have the privilege and/or the right to be able to have their phone out inside the car? While there are some good reasons why you should have the right, there are some things that people just can't help.

We already can't stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and now a days more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people don't even realize that there even doing it and most care now a days have the Bluetooth or people sell Bluetooth devices so you can be on call and drive while you drive making it better for the people but as tested on ""MythBusters"" changes a little but still distracts you in some sort of way people also know there way around things already and sometimes work or no most of the times it works but some of the times it doesn't under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or ""fine print"" and they can just say oh well it's like a Bluetooth but it wasn't type of stuff and the court can't do anything about it.

This is what I think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally I don't care what they do or say all I care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or not.

They (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can't lie, or anything even know they shouldn't even if it's an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn't do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car.

This is what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent
B8EB9AC4606F,"Cell phones have become very popular. Almost everyone who is old enough to drive owns a cell phone. They have become a part of life. Cell phones are an asset this day and time, but they can also be very dangerous. Although cell phones are a necessity, I do not think they should be used while driving.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. You shouldn't be on your phone while driving. It causes all types of tragic deaths. The best way to stop it is to enforce the no use law. People die almost every day from this. When you drive and text it causes accidents and deaths. People have a hard time with texting and driving. They just have to pick up the phone that instant. To me, I fill like electronics are evil to humans because since they dropped the first phone the death rates has increase.

Using your phone and driving is just like drinking and driving. I saw my mother actually texting and driving and she slam on brakes. It was very scary at the moment because we were young. People just love to do that. I'm not going to lie if the phone call is important to me, I am going to answer it, but I will try to pull off of the road first. I do not want to cause an accident and hurt myself or someone else just to answer a call or text. That can wait.

Using cell phones while driving put everyone's life in danger. We don't know what the person behind the wheel is going through. There is nothing so important it can't wait. Next time you get that phone call or text while driving, wait until you stop the car to answer it. You could save your life or the life of someone else.        ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

The call or text can wait because you have to take your eyes off the road to answer or reply. Many times when you're texting and driving you misspell words and then you have to go back and correct it. So therefore when you go back and correct it your eyes are still off the road. This also means you are risking your life and someone else's life by being on the phone . In addition this leads to my next reason.

Cell phones are a distraction. They are a distraction because if you get a notification you're going to look for your phone. You can look down for 1 second and anything can happen. Also when people talk on the phone they are distracted. They have a tendency to look ways that they aren't supposed to and they drive crazy.

In conclusion drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. It is a distraction and the call or text can wait. Remember when you drive you have to drive for yourself and drive for others too. So try to avoid texting or answering and call while driving especially if it's just a friend.

5E538C8612E2,"In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours an average of 660,000 people are using electronic devices while driving. People from ages 16-24 are mostly involved in car accidents having to do with texting and driving.

When you text and drive you put not only your life at risk, but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.

Texting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing a death. When you text and drive you are distracted and are not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving is bad and also illegal.

Additionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.

In conclusion, texting and driving does not need to occur. do not do anything else in your car besides paying attention to the road and having both of your hands on the steering wheel. People around the world need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in. too many people di because others are too worried about their phones instead of the people around them.

On a daily basis the majority of humans own and utilize cell phones. The use of a cell phone while driving can lead to injuring yourself; injuring others on the road; and having a record in the system. Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones while driving a vehicle.

Drivers are risking their lives when they decide to utilize their cell phones while driving. The cell phone is a form of distraction that can cause an accident. An article points out ""Failing to keep a proper lookout and to pay attention to surrounding dangers because of distractions caused by the cell phone"" (Warner and Sherman para. 4). Giving your phone a quick glance can result in an accident. Therefore, it's important to always keep your eyes on the road while driving.

People are not only risking themselves but others on the road as well; when they decide to use their cell phones. Talking or texting while driving is life threatening; that being the case it's essential not to try to multitask while driving a vehicle. When a driver is not being continuously attentive while driving; it can cause an accident. If they crash into another car; they're putting others life in danger. People need to be considerate of the other drivers on the road; so they need to be focused on their surroundings when driving.

Although, no state bans all cell phone use for all drivers. If you were to get in an accident because you were using a cell phone there would be consequences to the one at fault. If an accident were to occur you're more likely to face jail time; especially if it resulted in the other driver getting injured. Being in this situation can result in having a record in the system. A way to avoid this from occurring you would have to consider to put your cell phone on 'Do not disturb'.

At the end of the day it's a choice to decide whether or not you're going to utilize a cell phone while driving. Humans need to be cautious because their actions can affect others immensely.

Losing the privilege to drive can be upsetting, all the work that's put in just to get the privilege to drive. Driving is a privilege that we earn and lose, this essay discusses the ways to lose and keep the privilege to drive. There are multiple ways to lose the privilege of driving but one way is by using a electronic device while behind the wheel. Most people believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones,texting,etc. while operating a vehicle.

Driving while talking on the phone can get others and the driver hurt. One example could be hydroplaning. Hydroplaning is caused by traction and sliding on a film of water. Using one hand for driving and the other hand for the phone while it's raining is a creation of an accident and getting the privilege to drive taken away. Your driving privileges would be taken away because the driver has a phone in their hand and it's not allowed to have a phone in the vision of the driver behind the wheel.

Another example would be of course texting and driving because once again there is a phone in the hand of the driver instead of both hands on the wheel and no one paying attention to the road. This could lead to an accident because many drivers don't know where they're going and the car could lose control. Driving with a device in your hand is a distraction because your attention should be focusing on your surroundings and the vehicles on the road.

To keep from getting hurt and jeopardizing your life and the life of others,drivers should follow the Hands Free Law. The Hands Free Law is a proposed driving law that states that a driver shall not ""record or broadcast a video"" on any mobile phones, iPads, computers or touching any part of their bodies while operating a vehicle. Even with the Hands Free technology, drivers are not allowed to write, read, or send any messages or emails, but voice to text is allowed. Voice to text is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output or when the speaker can speak into their device and it translates their words into a text so that the speaker is able to answer the text message or any other important subject.

Driving is a privilege. Responsible drivers should always pay attention to the road and other drivers. Cell phones should always be out of the drivers hand so they may maneuver the steering wheel and not drive reckless. Drivers need to remember that driving is a privilege and that it can easily be taken away from you.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Imagine not making it back home to your loved ones. Imagine what you could cause and put other people through that they didn't deserve, because they were doing the right thing. Or put yourself in their shoes. Just think about it before you decide to pull your phone out and possibly cause accidents maybe death. We can prevent things happening like that if we just do the right thing. Is the cell phone worth it? That's a decision for you to make.

With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.

If you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger.

Results from using phones while driving can lead to death, PTSD, depression if you get into a car accident. Using a phone while driving increases the risk of their lives. Also the drivers are more distracted making it hard to focus on the road which is leading to crashing. When stopped at a red light people feel as if it is safe little do they know it is just as risky because a car can come smashing into you and you wouldn't see it. Also you can make people mad because the light could turn green and you could be holding up a line.

For people to use their phone less there was a bluetooth, a hands free thing and air play which all 3 limit the use of the phone where you can just talk. It still is not safe but it is not as bad as using your actual phone. Instead of holding the phone to your ear you just speak, call whoever and you don't have to touch your phone. It is easier to just wait to text or use your phone than to rather take your life. For Iphone users apple company made a do not disturb to mute the notifications, which is when you won't receive any notifications until you turn that mode off.

Explain: These consequences can be very costly. The driver could end up paying over $1,000 dollars in fees. The driver would have to pay their ticket they received. Also, they might have to pay a lawyer if they license get suspended. Next, the driver will have to pay the fee When the driver attends court they might have to pay fees over $1,000 dollars.

If you receive the consequence of ticket you got to go to court. If you receive the consequence of your car getting towed you will have to go up to the tow shop and come out of pocket to pay to get your car out. If you receive the consequence of going to jail you will be wasting your freedom, when you can be in the world doing something else productive.

3rd Paragraph:

Point: driver need to drive with cautions of others and they self.

Example: When people drive with cautions driving is so much better, because people would be so scared to get one of those consequences that they will stay off they cellphones until they make it to their disination.

Explain: cellphones distract people when they driving, because people are quick to check they phone instead of the road. Its very easy to get distracted from driving and that one of the biggest distraction while driving. People don't understand that you don't have to check your phone every time it rings or ding. Everything will be just great with this no cellphone hand free law.

4th Paragraph:

Point: Drivers need to be more safe while driving with a cellphone.

Example: Driver that drive with a cellphone get distracted on what is really going in front of them. Drivers text and make videos when they driving. When people drive with a cellphone they the get distracted from the alerts they get from people,but its because we gotta get use to the new law.

Explain: The hands free law is to avoid people from being on they cellphones while operating a vehicle. The law got approve because a lot of people got into accidents for being on there cellphones while operating a vehicle. I am kind of happy the approved this law because people in Georgia do not know how to drive.

5th Paragraph

Reintroduce Thesis Statement: Using a cellphone while driving can lead to an accident, ticket, and going to jail.

Closing: Once people realize that the police are not about to play about this hands free law, that when they going to stop. i still see people on they phones and not pay attention to the road because they on there phones.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
E341A9A188EB,"Because it's a common activity for most people, sending a text doesn't seem dangerous. However, when you're doing it behind the wheel, there are a ton of other factors at play. Driving is a privilege because of the inherent risk and responsibility we all need to assume out on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers.

It can be hard to grasp the dangers of texting and driving, but once you know the facts, this hazardous habit starts to become a reality. When you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. In just the 5 seconds it takes to send or read a short text message, you've already zoomed past the length of a football field with minimal attention on the road ahead. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children.

No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel.

When you're behind the wheel, you should always be considerate of other drivers and remember you're putting your life at risk while texting and driving.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed?

While driving, you should always be focused on getting from point A to point B. Having any kind of mobile device in your hand while driving puts your life at a major risk. Once driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text message, suddenly the driver's life is changed by a horrific accident. People should definitely reconsider before pulling out their phones while on the road. Dr   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent

Many people have the bad habit of using their cell phones while they're driving every time they step into a car to drive somewhere. Both teens and adults have this habit and most drivers are aware that it is not a good habit to have. They could be texting people, calling people, getting on social media, etc. However, using a cell phone while driving is a huge distraction to the driver which is why it is such a bad habit to have. There are plenty of reasons as to why people should not use their phone while they're driving and why it's so dangerous to do so. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.

Since some people go on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident. If a person causes a car accident because of being on their phone, it can cause harm and even death to the driver, the passengers in the driver's car, other people driving on the road, and even pedestrians. There are many handfree ways to use a cell phone while driving instead of having the phone in the hand of the driver. According to a website called driving-tests. org, it states, ""Hands-free technology is easy to use and widely available."" An example of a hands-free technology that people can easily use would be a phone holder. With phone holders, people can place their phone in the phone holder on the dashboard so they can answer phone calls, use their GPS, etc. If the people with the bad habit of using their phones while driving get a phone holder, it would decrease the chances of getting into a car accident which will benefit everyone.

Being on the phone while driving not only is very dangerous and unsafe, it is illegal in most states to have a mobile device in the hands on a driver. Having a mobile device in the hands of a driver at any age is illegal in 10 states while having a mobile device in the hands of a novice driver is illegal in 32 states. Since it is illegal in most states, the consequences could be getting a ticket, having to pay a fine, or possibly getting some jail time. There is a website called araglegal. com, and on the website it says, ""Texting and driving makes a crash up to 23 times more likely."" That is the reason it is illegal to even have a phone in the hand of a driver in some states because it results in bad consequences. To avoid bad consequences from happening, drivers can be smart to not even touch their phone while they're driving, they could easily pull over to use their phone instead of using it while driving, etc.

Many adults use their cellular device while they're driving and sometimes, they even do it with their kids in the car. Doing that sets a bad example and gives a horrible influence on kids.

When kids grow up and learn how to drive, they might use their phone while they're driving because they're going to think that it's okay since their parents did the same exact thing.

According to ""4 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Text and Drive,"" it states, ""Why wouldn't young drivers think it's okay to text and drive? They've seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents."" That quote from the website explains the mindset of a young driver perfectly; Having this mindset as a young driver is not good to have because it can cause multiple consequences for them. So if adults don't use their phone while they're driving, especially when their kids are in the car, young drivers will make the smart decision and not be on their device while driving.

Almost everyone knows that it's dangerous to be on the phone while they're driving but people still do it regardless. It would make the world so much easier if people stayed off their phones while driving because there wouldn't be as many car accidents happening. Every driver needs to think about what would happen if they caused a car accident just because they were on their phone and driving at the same time. If someone caused a car accident because they were paying attention to their phone and not the road, and someone died, the person that caused the accident would feel so guilty. In conclusion, every driver needs to know the dangers of being on their phone while driving and why they shouldn't do it so there can be less car accidents. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.

The rate of of people dying in automobiles has increased 300% because of people using their phones while driving. Using a phone while driving should NOT even be debatable. The consequences that could come with that are way too dangerous. It could cause distractions, an accident or even worse, death. Being in any of those situations could be very harmful not just to you but the others in the car with you. The government should get involved by making laws.

Using phones while driving should be illegal everywhere.

To begin with, using your phone while driving could cause a distraction. For example, if you're driving and there's an ambulance or a police officer trying to get through because of an emergency, the driver may not hear or see the sirens because they are distracted on their phone. Someone could be critical conditions in the ambulance but can't get the hospital because of the person that's distracted on their phone. Sometimes you have to use your phone for an emergency. Just wait till you get to your destination. Cell phone distractions can also cause problems to a pedestrian or even a driver that is swerving. Being distracted by a cell phone is similar to being drunk and driving.

Another consequence that it could have is an accident could occur. It could be the slightest accident but its still considered an accident. Which means someone has to call the cops to report the accident and the cop will take at least 45-60 minutes just to arrive which is a waste of time and money because if it was your fault your insurance cost rise up 60+ more a month. Depending on what the driver already pays it could be way more. That's just for a slight accident. All of that for using your mobile device.

Last but not least, the use of your phone while driving can cause death. The driver could be so distracted that they are unaware of how fast they are driving. If you get into a head on accident at a high speed it can cause death or even crashing into a tree at high speed it can do the same. If you have others in the car with you, you're putting others lives at danger. That could affect the people that love you and love them as well. All of that because you forgot to shoot someone a text back.

Yes, we get it, sometimes using your phone while you're driving is needed for an emergency. Don't just use it to text your friends back or to put music on. Do all that before you take off. Because remember all the bad things that could happen just for using your phone while driving. Keep your eyes on the road.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Although Cell Phones are pretty useful it does not mean that people should be glued on to it the whole time. They may help connect one another, but at some points, the phone has to be put down. Such as when someone is doing tasks that need them to be focused. For example, driving needs the person driving to be all the way focused. Although most people may tend to use their phones for a GPS system most cars in this modern day have a GPS system within it. Phones should not be used in driving because of less attention on the road, setting a bad example for young children, and it is worse than driving under the influence.

First of all, cell phones are a Manual distraction. This means that the tasks that require the driver to take a hand off the steering wheel and manipulate a device. (Hilbert 24) Due to this, the driver is more distracted and unsafe when driving. According to the text ""This inventory highlighted aspects of equipment designs that could affect driver distraction.""(Hilbert 30) This means that the driver would spend more time looking at a screen than on the road. As stated by the author, ""Cellular phones, and other in-vehicle distractions, force drivers to divide their limited attentional resources among tasks, thereby focusing less of their attention on driving."" (Delashmit 160)

Phones may still be useful for people but less time looking at the road is still not a good thing and could set a bad example for younger children.

Secondly, children have a developing mind. Meaning that certain events may scar them for life. They may even think that it is okay to be on the phone. As it states in the text "" For example, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in collaboration with NHTSA, found that driver inattention was involved in 80 percent of all vehicle crashes (65 percent of near-crashes)."" (Delashmit 150) If a parent or older sibling, while a child is in a car, is on the phone when driving then they are more likely to be distracted from the road and crash. The younger people are trusting the person who is driving and if there were to be an accident then it could start the development to a mental health disorder. As stated by the author ""These implications highlight the degree to which a child or adolescent is likely to be involved, witness or experience a crash or the consequences of a crash and therefore be subjected to any number of physical injuries or psychological disorders.""(Greydanus 92) If it was not bad enough driving under the influence is a little like worse then spending eighty percent of the time on the phone while driving.

Finally, although driving under the influence is bad, it is still not worse then spending more time looking on the phone then on the road. As stated in the text ""The public does not appear to be as cognizant of this social responsibility aspect, as distinct from personal risk, for in-vehicle technology use, compared to alcohol.""(Hilbert 153) This meaning that driving under the influence is not as bad as being on the phone.

A test was conducted to see how drivers would drive under the influence or on the phone. The results where ""Some studies of cell phone use have compared the degradation of performance to some level of alcohol impairment. Strayer, Drews, & Crouch (2006), for example, found in a study of simulated driving that drivers using cell phones had elevated crash risks similar to those of drivers with blood alcohol concentrations of approximately .08 g/dL, though the specific impairments of each group differed."" This test showed that there were more accidents with being on the phone than driving under the influence.

Although some may say that having the phone out is okay seeing as it is used for navigation. There are laws in place for driving and having a cellular device. As stated by the text ""These laws take several forms: Some require drivers to use a hands-free device if they want to talk on the phone, some prohibit younger or less experienced drivers from using any type of cell phone, and some allow officers to cite drivers for using a handheld cell phone if the driver is pulled over for another offense.""(Guerin 163) As shown they only get in trouble or is only bad if they have it in their hand only if they get pulled over and the officer sees it in their hand. Driving while on the phone is not bad.

In conclusion, phones and driving is not that good. It puts the risk of lives on the line. It causes more vehicle accidents on the road than any other distraction. Although it maybe be handy to help navigate it still should not be used eighty percent of the time while on the road. It sets a bad example for children. It is still slightly worse then driving under the influence. Driving and having a phone out is bad.

In 2015, the United States started to focus on the problem that was phone use while driving. Distracted driving has taken many innocent lives. According to enddd. com 37,416 lives were lost in 2016 due to distracted driving. No matter how much the death rate rises people still use their phones while operating a vehicle. Most people have the argument that having a phone mounted so they could have two hands on the wheel eliminates the problem. However, the level of danger is still high. There are opinions that the use of cell phones while driving have little to no negative effects, but there is much more compelling evidence that it is a serious hazard to be distracted while driving.

While driving with other motorist around, it is imperative to keep all focus on the road. The smallest mistake could lead to a major accident including people that were not involved. In 2012 alone, 3,328 people were killed in distracted driving crashes, a number that continues to go up (Distraction. Gov). As technology advances they rate of distracted driving increasing. It has been uncovered that people between the ages of 18 and 25 have the highest rates of distracted driving. Text messaging creates a crash risk 23 times worse than driving while not distracted (Distraction. Gov).

On the contrary, it is understood that a phone might need to be used in a state of emergency. However, answering to an emergency can cause one of your own. Imagine being in a state of panic and stress with the addition of cell phone use while driving. Now there is another state of peril. It's better to get to the emergency than not getting there at all.

In conclusion, people are still being severely injured and even killed because of drivers distracted by phones. People walk through and across the streets scared for their lives, wondering if they will make it to their destination. How many deaths must occur before people realize how dangerous their actions can be? No one will ever know the real answer How many children are going to have to lose their parents, or for that matter, how many parents are going to have to lose their children before this danger can be stopped? No one will ever know the answer. All that can be done, as of now, is to try the best ways that can be done.            ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

PROPER_NAME

People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

There are several reasons why and I will be discussing two of them. Cell phones are a convience to our society, but there should be a time and place for them to be used.

First, cell phones are a benefit and allows everyone to have access to a telephone at all times of the day.

Kids, teenagers, adults, even grandparents have cell phones.

As you pay attention to people that you pass by whether it's in traffic or walking, there is a cell phone in toat.

While riding a bike, people are on the phone.

While driving cars, people are on the phone.

While sitting waiting for a bus, people are on the phone.

Even while people are walking they are on the phone.

Do they get any break?

The phone that is?

With all of this phone use where is the focus of the individual?

Individual focus does not exist when everyone is on their cell phone.

Whether they are looking at the weather, SnapChat, Facebook, or Instagram, they are still not focused on their surroundings.

With the lack of focus there have been more accidents and deaths.

Accidents occur when you are distracted and death can easily follow.

While driving the attention needs to be on the road.

There have been documentaries where those that have lost loved ones due to inappropriate cell phone use read the last message that was sent or the last words that they user said.

Many times that call or message wasn't that important and could have waited.

Overall, individuals should not use cell phones while driving.

They cause distraction and lack of focus.

Many lives could be saved if people weren't careful about their cell phone usage.   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent

Smart phones have not been around for a very long time , but they have hugely impacted today's society. People can literally use their phones for anything which is not good , because it has become an addiction for many people. They are using them at the wrong times and of them is while driving. People are so focused on their phones that they risk their safety and others safety everyday. 1 reason that it's bad is because you can't pay attention to the road which can cause accidents and driving with 1 hand is not easy. This a very big hazzard that can be stopped , but people would rather be on their phones.

The National Safety Council report that cell phone use while drivng leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries are caused from texting while driving. This is not good. Too many people are being hurt and some are even killed from these fatal car crashes. The regulations must be changed because this is making the roads unsafe. People should not have to worry about if their life is in danger or not because someone is in on their phone.

In conclusion Phones and Driving isn't safe and it should not be permitted.

The Risk is very high and too many people are being hurt by the situation. We should try to fix this problem as soon as possible.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

First, cell phones and humans are like a duo and used by them almost every day. Humans and cars are also another duo or like a duo. But, people phones and cars and or driving? That personally is not a good idea. That is what I will be explaining in this essay. Is it or it is not a good idea to be texting and driving at the same time? Many different opinions from different people but, here is mine.

Next, have you ever been on a road with more than one lane and the person next to you is looking down on their device? Ask yourself do you think that is safe? Operating a cell phone is okay, and is done on a daily basis. People often think that since they have been texting and driving for long periods of time that they are experts and can do it with no problem. When in reality anything can happen at any moment you look down at your device, and it is certainly not safe.

Then, one of the number one causes of death in the world is car accidents. Usually it comes from texting and driving or even a drunk driver. Texting and driving is not safe and people should NOT be able to operate a vehicle and use cell phones. Why? Because, people die every day from a car accident either because of a device or drinking and driving. I believe that it will decrease the number of crashes and save many lives.

Therefore, Driving and texting should not be allowed. Very dangerous and you have a high risk of losing your life and others in your car and around your car. If you are in a vehicle your phone should not even be your main focus, because the road should have all of your attention. It is better to be safe than sorry on the road, and help prevent many accidents.

In conclusion,

I think phones and driving should NOT happen together. I mean as in texting and driving at the same time. It has been a law but is barely followed by anyone. Many people will still text and drive but, for people who care about other they will follow this law. Maybe even one day they will prevent someone else from losing their life.

It has been proven that driving without the use of your cell phone is 100% safer than driving while using your cell phone. Humans should not operate cell phones while driving, cell phone usage while driving is unsafe, People who use cell phones while driving put their lives in serious danger.

Humans should not operate cell phones while driving. People use their phones on a daily basis while driving yet, they pay little attention to the road while doing so. This can possibly cause accidents to happen. Many people have lost their life due texting and driving and just being on their phones. When driving its best to do it safely for the sake of your own like and others. Using your phone while driving dramatically increases your chances of crashing.

Cell phone usage while driving is unsafe. #1 reason why it is unsafe is because you can lose your life. Just reaching for things while driving takes your main focus off of the road and put you in danger. When your distracted from the road anything can happen even if its just a second thats all it takes for everything to go bad. For instance the second you look down at your phone for that text message is the same secon a pedestrian can walk across the street or another vehicle can cross your path and just like that your life can be ruined or it can be over.

People who use their phones while driving put their lives in serious danger. Recent studies have shown that the victims on texting and driving accidents are young drivers and the elderly. Kids are too attached to their phones and having a car at a young age today is an immediate risk one text message and they instantly have to read the message and at that moment it could be over. Cell phones should be put away while driving or on a phone holder just to keep things safe. All attention should be on the road and if needed a person can easily pull over and make a call.

Just put down the phone that one message or missed call can wait its not worth your life. People should stay safe and just be patient and pay attention to the road and others.                     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Everyday people die in car accidents and or get injured very badly because they use cell phones while driving. It is illegal in many states and it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive because these actions could lead to vehicle crashes. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

One reason drivers should not use cellphones while texting and driving is because it is illegal in most states. If drivers are caught using their cellphones while driving they will be forced to pay a fine. Fines can cost from $20 to $250 dollars depending on different aspects. This fine is supposed to intimidate people when they use a cell phone while driving. People need to take caution of their surroundings so there are no wrecks; therefore, if you look down at your phone even for just a second a lot could happen which is why you need to be more alert while driving.

Another reason why not to use a cellphone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are much less dangerous. For example, the earpiece can be used to accept calls and to talk into this way you can keep both hands on the steering wheel. Do not have both earpieces in so you can listen out for other vehicles and your surrounding. Another hands free device is a car kit, if you do not have one in your car you can always buy one. Car kit is basically a touch screen radio and instead of texting you can voice your text to the carkit. It is okay to use your phone as long as your car is in p (park).

In conclusion, you should not use a cellphone while driving because it is illegal, it can lead to vehicle crashes. There are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road.

Communication has progressed from the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 to the endless communication that is now available in the 21st century, but it has come at a price. People's need for communication, specifically with cell-phones has created the serious issue of cell-phone use while driving. This issue leads to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving.

This issue has caused various accidents and sometimes deaths. The distraction that cell-phones create while driving has the ability to seriously injure or even take someone's life away. For many years, while most states have not had laws regulating cell-phone use while driving, there have been various PSA campaigns warning against cell-phone use while driving, usually specific with texting and driving. These PSAs are meant to scare drivers hoping that it will discourage this dangerous behavior.

These distracted drivers are usually texting to reply to someone, using their satellite navigation system on their phone, or could be adjusting their music through their phone. These behaviors have been specifically targeted by many states that have enacted laws to prevent cell-phone use that can cause accidents. Georgia, specifically, passed the hands-free rule, fining drivers for cell-phone use, holding the phone. This law can be easily obeyed because of the adjustments created by car companies and other accessories that are available. More recent cars have options for phones through the car to keep the driver focused on the road but keeping the communication possible for the driver. Cars may have an aux cord or a bluetooth option to be able to receive and make calls without touching the phone. Phones connected to the car this way, can play music through a cell-phone through the car, then the driver can control volume and choice of song through the steering wheel. There are many car accessories to make phone use safer like an attachment to the windshield that holds the driver's phone, to keep their eyes in the front to the road rather than to the side to look at their phone. These adjustments that coincide with laws like the hands-free rule allow drivers to safely use their cell-phones while driving.

This issue has lead to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving, but will continue to have serious consequences. While there are many solutions to this issue have been created it will still have consequences. People will continue to be injured or killed by this issue but without any restrictions or inventions this issue would not continued at the same rate. The precautions keep the roads as safe as they can be, because people will continue to use their cell-phones while driving, but at least it is more regulated and less distracting now.

12BD6AF88485,"Over the years cell phones have become a very useful tool .The demand of using a phone has risen in today's society . But should we be able to use our cell phones while being on the road? The number of people that have used their phones on the roads and highways have increased so much . Some people don't understand how important it is to be completely focused on the road and for the people in their car and everyone near them. Should we leave a message unread or not answer a call or answer the text or call but be at risk of causing the life of someone ?

People tend to always want to be on their phones and be in touch with other people during social media, call, or text , despite the danger of causing an accident. We keep our phones closer than our loved ones. Phones are a constant distraction such as meetings, movies ,meals and especially when we are driving. Everyday people die from car accidents because someone was using their phone while driving . Studies have shown that there is a 4% greater risk of drivers being in a car accident due to using a cell phone. Overall the crashes every year because of cell phones are 1.6 millions with 330,000 million injured in them.

Hands free devices can also be harmful . You are focused on the road but if something happens to your phone for example the call ended or you received a message then you are distracted and want to grab your phone . A lot of people would think that probably if I just take one second to look at my phone nothing will happen. But that's not true a car accident can happen based on the driver not looking on the road . You can't multitask when you are driving ! If you would like to be a safe driver you would have to make sure you process a ton of information about your environment and surroundings at all times.

Georgia's new hands free cell phone law has resulted in more than 1,000 tickets since the start of the law . Georgia's residents aren't allowed to have their phone in their hand or part of their body . They are only allowed to use if it's on a wireless headphones, speaker or bluetooth . Their first fine is $50 , second is $100, and third is $150 and a subsequent conviction . Georgia has become the 16th state that enacted a hands free driving law. Georgia would like for residents to stop using their devices when driving because cell phones only continue to increase the number of accidents.

It's a privilege to be able to drive and we shouldn't just think about ourselves but about the people we are risking when we are driving. Cell phones are a very important tool in our life but we should know when it's not the right time to use it. It's better to leave the phone down and ignore the missed calls and texts then not being able to get to our destination and being with our loved ones because we couldn't leave our phone down. Put it down and just drive !   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Even though people this they can do it without an accident, people should not be using a phone while driving. Teens, being the main group of people driving distracted, including the fact that the majority of they are newly trained drivers could cause more damage than just a crash. In 2017, over 3000 people were killed due to drivers being distracted. Some things aren't worth the risk and can just be pushed off to another time. While driving and using the device you are putting other drivers, passengers, bystanders and even yourself at risk of getting hurt or much worse.

In any case, while you are texting and driving, you are not thinking about anyone else other than yourself. The main thing going through a person's head while on their phone is what's happening on the screen. You readers may have, or know someone who could be looking at their phone and not hear a word someone says. It's already disrespectful to be on your phone while talking to somebody, so imagine how crazy it is to be on it while operating dangerous vehicle at high speeds. Texting and driving is more of an impulse, the driver is more worried about getting caught than hurt ,but the punishment of death and homicide is worse than texting and driving.

Without a doubt, you may think that the person you are texting or the game that you are playing can be done at another time. The game can wait till you are out of the car, but if you need to communicate with someone, there are many alternatives than doing it while driving. You have option to call someone and put your phone on spreaker so it will be out of your way, pulling over into a parking lot is also a choice and finally texting at a red light or stop sign only if its legal in your state. Like the famous quote from Star Trek, The

Wrath of Khan, ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" meaning that you have to put the majority over yourself even if you think you shouldn't.

Although, you may not want to die, there are still more simple reasons you should avoid using your phone while driving. If you get caught you will have to pay an expensive fine and your car insurance will go up. Paying hundreds of dollars is not worth one text, one youtube video of anything else you could be doing on it. Most of the people who text and drive probably is doing it because they will be busy later, but going to court for a ticket will just add more to your schedule.

As a result, you as a reader can see all the risks and should yourself

""is this really worth it""? In a situation like this, the cons outweigh the pros and that's not good. If you want others to care about you then you have to respect yourself first to show them what it looks like. Think about the family of the kid you ran over all to heart some instagram post, it's not worth it. If you truly want to be a responsible driver, then obey the laws and don't use your phone while driving.

In my perspective, I think drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. The reason why I say this is because people don't pay any attention to what they are doing because they so caught up in their devices. Driver can get killed and they can hurt somebody else if they are using their cell phones. They not only putting their life in danger, but also somebody else's life too.

Drivers can be drunk while driving and be on their cell phone and end up killing themselves. Instead of being save and advoiding that risk that they are doing right now, they are being very dangerous of themselves and others. That's why now in today's history, it is rare that people pull over on the side of the road to be on their cell phones. The ones who do that are very smart because they aren't taking a risk to hurt themselves or others.

You have to be careful of what you are doing when you're in a car driving and being on the phone. That's why today, a lot of people buy a cell phone holder to put in their car. The reason is that they can talk on the phone but also pay attention to the road so they won't get in a car crash. It is just crazy that people would not think about what they are going to do when they are using a cell phone when they are driving. That's why for me, I think it would be safer just to buy a cell phone holder to put inside your car so you can talk but also pay attention to the road and what you are doing.

Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones during driving. They shouldn't be able to because they can cause an accident and harm people, and cause addiction. Using your phone during driving can hurt many people and cause people to get addicted and not pay attention to the road.

If drivers could use their phones while driving, they can harm people and cause accidents. If they're on their phone they would most likely not pay attention to the road. They can hurt kids and cause road problems. They could even mess up their jobs focusing on their phone and not the objective. Devices can become over powering.

If drivers could use their phones, it could become addicting and cause problems. They can get addicted to their phone and not pay attention. Devices get addicting and can do too much and can decrease focus. They can be going through a problem and not focus on their man goal.

Technology has extremely increased in today's generation. Many people have a tendency to rely on their devices while driving. Phones are very addictive to have. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They will look at the phone while doing everything. The main problem that is occurring is that people are texting while driving an automobile. Should or shouldn't drivers be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle.

I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving unless for navigation. It's extremely dangerous to look of the road to send one simple text messages. For example, if you are driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellular device while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving, unless it for directions, a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. It's okay to want until your done driving to use your cellphones! So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.

The risk of texting and driving is a big risk, you take 20-35 seconds to look, type, and deliver a message while operating a vehicle going at a fast pace which could potentially hit anyone or anything under those few seconds leaving the driver and them hurt or possibly even dead. It is said that in the United States around 1 out of 10 people are killed by distracted drivers everyday because they choose to put their attention towards texting instead of focusing on the wheel. In today's society mostly everything is run off by technology and its how nowadays we communicate with one another, but there are moments when it is necessary to put down your devices and it's when you are driving a vehicle.

There are many methods on preventing texting and driving and one is simply just putting your device down and not use it when behind the wheel. Another way to prevent texting and driving is using a cell phone stand which prevents you from looking down at your phone but instead having the phone next to your view of the road. If anybody else is in the car let they should wield the device while the driver is operating the vehicle and let them know if any important notifications appear. These methods just take very little time so they can prevent a risk of taking the driver's life or anybody who is at risk of being a victim of a distracted driver.

It is believed to say people are more likely to die in a car crash by a distracted driver rather than a driver who is drunk or under the influence of marijuana. Even if that is to be said, there are still people that are confident enough to multi-task and risk the chances yet they don't know their reaction time is slow as an elderly due to them paying attention to several things at once which causes a commotion in the brain.

Phone companies such as AT&T have tried preventing these kind of things by starting a campaign and having traffic signs say things to prevent drivers from being on their phones while driving. These acts help prevent accidents and possibly reduce accidents in the future.

In my honest opinion about phone's and driving they do not go together at because both you have to use full attention on when using especially with how things are now and days. It's really dangerous when doing it driving a car because cars are this big built mobile that if you get into a crash and risk your life and or money for insurance on it. Now I think you could balance it between Phone and driving if your good at that like at a red light maybe take a quick glance and it see what it is and then back to driving or get a car that can pick up phone calls.

Now with phones people are so attracted to phones now they can't even walk straight without bumping into people now is it bad to use phones no I don't think it is but when driving is a different story you are putting your life a risk with using a phone. You are putting other peoples life's at risk with doing that too.

When it comes to cars you need your full attention when driving a car everything needs to be sharp because there is dangerous things everywhere so you need to be aware of that when driving so that nothing bad happens. You can't do that when you're on a phone because you're taking away your senses from driving.

I don't think it is a good idea at all to do it unless you know what you're doing and have a car that can pick up phone calls and does not take your time away from driving on the road and therefore can keep you safe and everyone else around and get to your destination safely.

Generation X is constantly caught having used a cellphone while operating a vehicle. The cell phone is a ""life saver"" and helps individuals with everyday tasks. However, while driving to a destination is the use of a cell phone prohibited? And if not, to what extent is it ok to use a mobile on the road?

The use of cellphones on the road is legal with certain restrictions in which not followed could result in a justified prosecution. Driving with a cellular device under the age of 18 while driving is strictly prohibited. Driving is a more taxing experience than most realize. It is a death sentence if not taken seriously. Nearly 1.6 million crashes happen annually to texting and driving. This is due to the driver taking his/her attention of the road and not being aware of their surroundings. There should be not lenience when it comes to texting and driving and should be promoted not be a social norm.

Texting and driving is not a smart way to drive. There are too many variables as to what the outcome could turn out to be. Many people lose their lives to such things. Is that one text really worth someone's life?                                       ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

Texting and driving has become a huge issue. Many car accidents have occurred by being on the phone. Most people think texting and driving is not a serious thing but in reality, it has caused many lives. Police have been cracking down and a lot on this situation. Phone companies like Apple have put a do not disturb setting on the phone for driving. You turn it on and it will silence all calls and texts messages, so it won't temp you to pick up your phone. Many teens have been in an accident due to texting and driving. This has become a dangerous issue in society that has caused many lived and needs to be stopped.

In this paragraph I am going to be talking about the dangers that texting and driving have. Currently 46 states have banned texting and driving due to many accidents. This problem is occurring a lot with young teens. Many teens don't know how to put their phone down while driving they feel they need to always have it in their hand. 21% of teen drivers who were involved in fatal car accidents were distracted by their cell phones. 330,000 injuries arise each year from texting a driving. There are many organizations dealing with texting and driving. They also have addictions programs if you are addicted to your phone and cannot put it down. Phone addiction is a real thing, many people struggle with and don't realize it. Sources say that ""94% of drivers support imposing a ban on texting while driving"". It has been proven that texting while driving its 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk and that really should tell you something. This is huge problem that can be solves so easily if people would just put their phone down.

Many car companies have been making self-driving cars. This makes people think it is okay to be on their phone while driving because the car is driving itself when in realty it is just as dangerous. I think texting white driving is a horrible thing I think it should be banned. I say this because many have died and many more were injured. It should not be allowed at all it puts the person that's driving in danger and other drivers. I think that police cracking down on texting and driving is a good thing. It will make more people stop doing it if they know they will get a ticket or possibly jail time. People will not stop until they know it will be serious consequences, they don't take it as a big deal. Research also shows that when people are talking on the phone, crash risk quadruples. The national safety council estimated that cellphone use leads to more than 1.6 million crashes every year. A first offence of texting while driving is 50 or more. I think that price needs to be much high then 50 dollars. I say this because if tickets were higher like maybe 100 or more lots of people wouldn't be texting and driving because they wouldn't want to pay that high ticket.

In conclusion I think texting and driving is a horrible thing that needs to be stopped. How many more lives is it going to take before people see how horrible it is. As a society we need to do better for our safety. We need to stop being so distracted by our phones and focus on making it where we need to go safely. The biggest age group affected by this problem is aging from 16 to 30. We need our young teens and our adults to do better and learn to put the phone down for their own safety. In the end we all want our country to be better and safer place. We want to live are life to the fullest and enjoy the good times so we should start thinking wise and be safer and it can start by not texting while driving.     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
4457F02B554A,"Drivers should not be able to use a cell in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I feel like that's the least safe thing you can do while a driving a motored vehicle. I think all of your undivided attention should be focused on driving. Your life isn't the only one in harm, but you're also jeopardizing someone else's life putting them in harm. Safety first; extracurricular activities later.

First of all, driving while you're on your phone is very dangerous and can be life threating within just 5 seconds. Most car accidents today are from people who were distracted by their phones. According to statistics from ""The National Safety Council"", cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. I feel like if more people were less distracted by their phones then there would be fewer car accidents than there are today. One out every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Second of all, though you may be only replying to a quick text or answering a quick call, but those few seconds you took to look at your phone traffic is still going. I agree that phones should not be in use while operating a vehicle because not only does the phone user get dangerously injured, it could cause someone else get hurt, too. I would advise anyone to not get caught driving while using their device now today because there are consequences.

A cell phone should not be used while operating a vehicle because driving should be number one priority.

Third of all, although I feel as if phones shouldn't be prohibited while operating a car but there are some reasons it would be reasonable to use your phone while driving. I think the only reason you should use your phone is too answer important calls only nothing more. The only way you could answer those important calls are if you have Bluetooth and your phone is connected. I feel that if you have to remove your hand from the steering wheel to use your phone you shouldn't. I say phones should shouldn't be used at all inside of a vehicle that on.

Most of all, drivers shouldn't use their phone while driving because it's very life threatening and dangerous. Driving while texting doesn't only just put your life in harm it puts others that are around. Texting and driving is a big distraction; focus should always be number priority while driving. Most accidents that occur today are from distracted drivers who were on their phone .Even though they were on phones for short amount of time, within that time span a car accident can occur.

In today's society, Phones have become a necessity. There are even some people that own two phones. Many people have become so reliant on their phone that they have built a tendency to use it whenever they can, or when they feel like it is ok to use it. People use their phones when they are out with family, friends, or when they are driving. Phones have become a menace to our safety on the road. Although, there are some drivers that are responsible when it comes to driving, that does not make the road any safer. Everyone still has a chance of getting into an accident with someone who was too busy on their phone while driving.

People who use their phones while driving are part of the menace to our safety. People who use their phones while driving are distracted from what is happening around them. Some people are against phone usage while driving, but are the people who usually do it. People today do not usually commit to a cause because they believe it will never be achieved, so they just join in and start to not care of what might happen next. That is why laws on phone use while driving should be much harsher.

There are laws against phone usage in the United States, but that does not completely stop people from using their phone. Laws should be much stricter, and a bit of a bigger punishment. If the laws that prohibit the use of phones while driving were much stricter then maybe the use of phones while driving will deplete greatly. This will result in accidents going down which would make the road a safer place for new drivers, and drivers in general.

Laws on phone usage while driving should stricter. This resolves in less accidents, safer roads, and cops not having to pull over and write multiple tickets, or arresting as many people just for using their phones as they drive.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

You see ads on tv, on your phone, on billboards, pretty much everywhere, and they are taking american lives.

There's a lot of problems phones bring to the table, but Americans getting distracted by them is one of the most common causes of death in the us. One quick peek at your phone and suddenly there's a semi truck coming at you 100 miles per hour. It can happen in almost an instant. And the numbers are there to back it up! There is no way more than 25% of the people killed per year expected or saw the crash coming.

The government has taken slow action, creating the ""hands-free"" law. This law makes it illegal to touch your phone while driving at all, but it isn't exactly being enforced. Sure, cops are now allowed to arrest people for touching their phone, but it just made people hide their phone better while driving, which honestly causes more accidents.

There are so many ways to fix this problem. For example, apple could make a feature where when your phone is moving above a certain speed, your phone locks itself until you have stopped moving. While Apple has a feature like this, it's easily avoidable as there's a button on the screen that opens your iphone.

I hope these essays give you a reason not to touch your phone while driving. It's just seconds before you realize what's happening, and there's no going back when you cant even see what's coming.

Should phones be acceptable to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Today, we will basically cover why people should be able to drive and use their cell phones. Nowadays, with all the technology some cars are capable to drive on their own. Tesla would be a company that has started this whole new thing called autopilot.

Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system which has lane centering, adaptive cruise control, self-parking, the ability to automatically change lanes, and the ability to summon the car to and from a garage or parking spot. If you were to have that feature the car basically drives itself with asking you every 30 seconds to 2 minutes to grab the steering wheel and move it side to side just a little. Tesla has also announced sometime in 2020 that the car will be able to detect stop signs, cross-walks, stop lights, etc,. Which means the car is fully capable to drive itself anywhere you put the navigation to take you and you could fall asleep to your destination.

In addition, the Tesla model 3 has been tested and said to be one of the safest cars in the world with many of its safety features in the cars system. So if you're capable of purchasing the car then I think you should be able to use the phone while driving sense the vehicle is driving to begin with. But if you can not purchase the vehicle I think you should be able to use the navigation system on the phone and have it set up to where it's not dangerous to look of the road for a second as if you were checking how fast your going. Most people can not afford that car and they drive older models of cars which don't have all the new technology in their car and all the extra luxury.

In other words, phones should be allowed for some people to use while driving, while others can not. It really can not be unfair because if it was really important for them to use the phone while driving they might think I should work harder in life to be able to do all their things while driving. So people should and should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
034A48259522,"Texting while driving is a profoundly serious topic and it often comes up. Texting and driving are talked about all the time, but people don't take it in consideration to be serious about the situation. Some drivers say ""I can do text while driving"" or ""it'll only take a second"". Thinking / saying that is a foolish thing because all of us feel that we can multitasking. We take these situations lightly until something really happens and then we wish we could take it all back.

Texting and driving can be a serious hazard; for example, a Georgia teen, Cristina PavonBaker, got 15 years for killing her best friend. She was driving 105 mph, racing another student then she started to use snapchat and crashed into a tree. For that reason, I feel that it should be banned in all 50 states because this is a serious cause, and everyone is taking it lightly. People who use cell phones distraction rates are high. In this generation we use our cell phones a lot so when it's hard for us to concentrate and to focus on things that are more important.

When you are texting and driving it's like driving down a soccer field or football field blindfolded. According to my research, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for 2.5 seconds, which is how long it takes to switch lanes. It is dangerous and deadly to not only yourself but also to other drivers and passengers. Texting and driving have beat drinking and driving as the most leading cause of deaths among teens. Us teen are not the only ones, 49 percent of adult drivers admitted that they text and drive.

Teens die every day for making the wrong decisions and not caring about the outcome. We don't care about the law until something happens and we wish that we could go back in time and change everything and not do what we did. The penalties of texting and driving can be jail or prison time or a misdemeanor. The fine could be as low as $20 and as up to $500 depending on the

To sum it up, we would be better if phones weren't allowed in the car at all. You can be killed or can kill someone if you are distracted driving. We are always distracted by our phones so when we are driving, we are tempted to get on it and do stuff. When we do, we have consequences to our actions and sometimes we must pay for what we do. We need to take responsibility and own up for our actions. We need to stop taking things like this lightly. I hope I encouraged you to not do this and put the cell phones down.

There are some people in this world that are extremely good at multitasking but... most aren't. If you feel like you can be on your phone while you're driving you are out of your mind. I feel like the only reasons you should be able to use your phone in the car/ operating machinery is when your using the GPS or trying to play music and at that point you should be using voice control.

Like I said at the beginning of the introduction a lot of us in this world cannot multitask. We don't have the attention span to pay attention to the road and be on our phones. As soon as we see that text from our mom, significant other, or crush whoever it may be we immediately look at the phone and try to text them back. Me knowing me I can't try to do anything phone related because once I'm on my phone I check all my emails, social media, and everything interesting there. Trying to operate machinery while while being on your phone is extremely life threatening especially using power tools and or heavy equipment. When I say heavy machinery I mean cars too. Texting and driving or even being on the phone are driving are one of the biggest factors in the death rate of the united states at a whopping 41.75% a year.

Voice control... I feel like that should be something very high on all phone companies list when it comes to making the device. With voice control everything is easier and the death rate via texting and driving could be potentially cut down to a much better number like 25%. With all of that being said I feel like using our phones on the road and when driving is a very bad idea and is something that could use great improvement.

Teens, adults, and even officials are on their phones, the majority of the day. Although cell phones existence hasn't been very long they've seemed to be a huge impact on today's society. People tend to forget what they're doing outside the phone because of how much a distraction cell phone can be, which leads to accidents and injuries. Many people in today's world have picked up a bad habit of texting and driving and don't realize the fatal accident they have partaken. Texting and driving isn't just reckless it also shows how careless people are of others well being.

To begin, people should not be allowed to text and drive because of the dangers that it brings to the driver and other drivers around them. Texting takes your attention off the road which leads you to not notice things you may have been able to avoid if you were paying attention. Simple things such as slowing down because an animal is crossing the road instead of swerving off the street because of how late you noticed the situation due to the distraction of the phone. In addition to taking your focus off the road, texting and driving also limit your vision at night. When your driving at night the light from the phone can strain your eyes causing you not to be able to see when driving. The screen acts as a mini headlight which blinds the driver making you lose awareness of the road. Texting and driving can limit the abilities of the driver because of how drastic a distraction it can be.

Meanwhile, you also benefit when you're not on your phone and you're aware of the road and everything around you. For starters, a lot of people driving don't realize some of the things they pass by every day because of the fact they're always looking down at their phones. For an example, you may drive useless miles to a gas station because that's the first one you see when you look up from your phone, when there may have been a gas station you missed on the way. Not only that but you stay sure that you're not in trouble with the law. If one is to be caught texting and driving by an official, in addition to legal consequences, the driver can then lose points on there license and/or can get their license suspended or revoked. Teens have been reported to lose their license because of texting and driving which then leads them to have to wait more years in order for them to obtain another one. Adults have gotten the license suspended which causes them to have taken off from work and/or their kids to get another license. Getting your license taken away from you is and having to take time to get another is wasteful and can be avoided easily if you just put your phone down.

In conclusion, texting and driving is a serious matter. The consequences of texting and driving are serious and can the worst thing to happen to many of us. It can lead to your license being taken away from you, it can lead to a waste of gas and money, or more importantly, it can lead to very serious injuries. Put the phones down, the text or post can wait until your off the road.

Cell Phones have become very important to our lives. People use their cell phones for everything; texting, talking and to get on social media. However, these everyday things become a distraction when it comes to driving on the roads. It has become a big issue in modern day America. As more teens text and drive, many cases of texting and driving have occured, resulting in a mass of avoidable lost lives.

In 2016, The national Safety council reported that 1.6 million car crashes a year are caused by reckless teen driving, most of which, are by texting and driving. Teens nowadays can't even put enough effort into not using their phones for at least 20 minutes, and for what cost, their lives? There has to be a kind of restriction on texting, or any kind of activity on your phone, while driving.

Some phones already offer some programs or apps that let you disable your phone while you drive. Drivesafe mode is a built in program that is available only on some phones. Although, most of the programs similar to Drivesafe mode, are supposed to be turned on by the user. This is simple to disregard, and most drivers don't even know they have such kinds of apps on their devices.

As of 2019, most states have gone to the point where they feel the need to ban texting and driving by using the word of law. The state of georgia put in place the ""Hands -free phone"" law which only allows drivers to operate voice controlled devices whilst driving. Still, even with the price of a hefty fine, and in some cases, jail time, people still continue to text and drive.

In conclusion, a good solution to ending deaths and accidents by teens who text and drive, starts with the parents. Parents should monitor their teens phones while they are out. Not only does the technology of today let parents spy on their kids phones just to keep them out of trouble, but it will help keep them alive, too. Parents should keep track of their kids while they go out, and alert them to stop when they text and drive. No one can tell you better than your own parents to stay alive.

7C25CB4FA297,"Drivers shouldnt be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Imagine having to spend time in jail or prison because you hit someone and they are harmed, in critical condition or worse, maybe even dead. Besides facing possible jail time, the guilt you would feel for that is unbearable. Which is why using cellphones while operating a vehicle is an unacceptable decision. Not only is it against the law, but for one it is harmful all around, and it is also a complete distraction.

Driving while using a cellular device is illegal. Often times if an officer spots you using a cellphone while noticing you are driving, he or she will pull you over and give you a ticket. For one that's a silly reason for getting a ticket. Now money has to be spent to pay the fine all due to the fact that whatever was on your phone was so important. In some situations there may be an emergency that is that important, but if that's the case you pull over then use your cellphone. Especially if the situation is something that can make you panic, you shouldn't be driving while in a frantic state.

1.6 million crashes a year are due to cellphones. That's a lot! More than what it should be, considering the fact it is against the law. Like I said before the guilt you would feel if you were the cause of someone's serious maybe fatal injury would make you feel horrible. Or imagine if something happened to your loved ones because someone was texting while driving.

If something on your phone may be very important and you feel the need to use your cellphone, then you should pull over into a parking lot or maybe the side of the road depending on the circumstances. Like I stated before if something tragic is happening and your getting a call of text about it the last thing you'd be worried about is the road. Which can can an accident or an almost accident. Or even when someone sends you something funny while your driving your not going to be focused on the road, your going to either be laughing or replying. Maybe even both.

In conclusion, don't let using your cellular device while driving cause you to be another statistic and have the 1.6 millions crashes a year go even higher. Which leads me to, once again, why using cellphones while operating a vehicle is an unacceptable decision. Not only is it against the law, but for one it is harmful all around, and it is also a complete distraction.                                      ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
BA13728424E7,"Today we as humans live in a society that is controlled by the advancement of technology and as certain things become easier to access, we seem to get distracted by the objects we have at our disposal. Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.

The first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cellphones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.

Although using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.

In addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.

In conclusion, my stance in the argument on cell phone use while drives stands where I have shown in this essay. I hope you can agree with me as to why I believe in the change this will bring to our society and change the rates in accidents making our cities, town, and roads safer for everyone. This changes is a great feat that we can achieve as long as everyone is on the same page. Together we can relieve our worries of driving with care-free people driving beside us. We make our roads safer for everyone. The facts that I have stated in this essay are self-evident and require support from everyone in order to change our stands on cell phone use while driving.

Everyone sees drivers using their phones, but most people don't notice that sometimes it's you. Mobile devices have taken over during this technological era. The majority of people have and enjoy using phones. Whether they're looking at the newest post from someone on social media or texting a friend, family member, or stranger. Phones have the ability to keep people occupied for long or short periods of time. Using phones is okay until it comes to driving while using them. It turns into a whole new scenario where the user is gambling with their life with every tap, swipe, or click. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones for any reason while operating a motor vehicle; it puts you and others lives in danger, it is equally as bad as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and it's illegal in most states.

Distracted driving by the use of cellphones alone causes 2,600 deaths yearly. About 330,000 minor or major driving injuries too. Using mobile devices while driving impairs your ability to operate a motor vehicle. Forcing you to take your eyes off the road and focus your attention on it rather than the environment around you. Even if it's just for a couple of seconds, this can be devastating and lead to serious injury. Studies show that drivers who just talk to someone on a cellphone rather than texting respond to emergency braking situations 18 percent slower than if not. Imagine if these drivers were texting rather than just talking, putting their attention more into the message they're sending rather than the road in front of them. An emergency braking situation could be tragic for these drivers and lead to serious injury to them and the drivers in front and behind them. This shows that distracted driving can be devastating to you, and for the people in the vicinity. The danger caused by distracted driving is on par if not worse than driving under the influence.

Driving under the influence is seen as the sin of all driving, but is it really? A study done by Harvard University found that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs was very similar to driving distracted. 40 patients, nine percent of distracted drivers drove slower before breaking. 24 percent displayed an inability to keep pace with other cars because of the constant shifting of their attention. The same study found drunk drivers drove ""a bit"" slower than distracted and undistracted divers. With a serious increase of aggression, they pace cars more closely and more likely to break only seconds before a collision could occur. They also hit their breaks 23 percent harder than distracted and undistracted drivers. All participants had a BAC higher than 0.08 percent. The zebra's 2017 study states in 2015 drunk driving caused more deaths, while distracted caused more accidents. 10,265 drunk driving deaths vs 3,477 distracted driving deaths. 290,000 injuries caused by drunk driving vs 391,000 injuries caused by distracted driving. While drunk driving caused more deaths distracted driving caused more injuries, injuries that have the possibility of leaving permanent damage on the victim's body. Ruining innocent people's lives impeding what they once were good at just because a driver-focused their attention on their phone rather than their surroundings. States are now taking action against distracted driving to attempt to stop or at least cut down on driving accidents.

Currently, 48 states have banned texting and driving. Washington was the first state to ever pass any form of texting ban, doing it in 2007. 20 states have banned handheld cellphone use. No state has banned complete cellphone use, but 38 states have banned all cellphone use for teenagers who are operating the vehicle. All states who pass these laws all have a common goal. To lower distracted driver accident ratings for the state at hand, but do the laws work? Yes and no, California cell phone usage dropped 57% from 9.3% of drivers to 3.3% using their cellphones after the ban on handhelds in 2008. Even if the usage of cellphones dropped the crash ratings haven't this is where the no comes from. Bans in New York hope to see a decline in crash ratings, but there was basically no difference. The reason being drivers switched from handheld devices to using the car's new built-in interfaces to interact with the outside world. The new built-in interfaces aren't any safer like the companies claim they are and are just as bad when it comes to causing accidents. Banning the use of cellphones while driving did work because the use of actual cellphones dropped, but with new car technology allowing cellphones to connect to the car's interface the risk and threat of distracted driving is still just as bad.

Driving distracted isn't okay, and it never will be. It's the root of a majority of driving accidents. It can cause injury to you and the people around often fatal. It can even cost someone their life. It isn't as life-threatening as driving under the influence, but it's still dangerous.

Driving bans have lowered ratings cellphone use while operating a vehicle, but they still fail in stopping accidents. No matter how many laws are pushed or lives are taken driving distracted is here to stay unless something major changes. Car manufacturers are creating new technology that makes it easier than ever to drive distracted. It's a losing battle and it only gets worse by the year. Drivers shouldn't drive distracted, yet they still do, accidents happen every day. Just try to make sure you aren't on the giving end and hope that you aren't on the receiving.

The future brings many new advances in technology, and along with it, dangers and responsibilities. Cell phones are highly addictive, and although they are beneficial for connecting to the world and finding information efficiently, they have proven to be a major distraction and huge problem for drivers. People often get into car accidents while texting. Drivers should not be allowed within arm's reach of their mobile device because it can harm themselves and others on the road.

First of all, according to seriousaccidents. com, ""Distracted drivers are the top cause of car accidents in the U.S. today."" This means that texting while driving is more dangerous than being intoxicated behind the wheel. People - especially teenagers - can kill themselves and others when they text while operating a motor vehicle. If they're lucky to survive the crash but they kill others, they can serve up to 20 years in prison, according to criminal-law. freeadvice. com. 20 years is a serious amount of time to serve because of a text or call.

Secondly, many students get into car accidents due to texting. They can often collide with other students or adults and may cause an injury or death. Many people believe a text should be responded to in 10 minutes or less, so one can wait to arrive at their destination before texting again. Furthermore,, if a text is too important to ignore, a person should simply pull over so they can respond, instead of distracting themself from the road and putting others at risk.

Thus, no person should be allowed to have their phone while driving due to it posing a threat to one's own health and wellbeing, as well as others'. People should not answer texts or phone calls while they should be focused on the road when it can be such a huge distraction many problems can occur in the short period of time it requires to answer a phone call or text. It is much safer to simply wait to get to your destination.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile device use. Nevertheless, many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device. Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone to conduct calls, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash.

In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones.

In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving.

It only takes a few seconds to look at your phone and get distracted. Within those few seconds anything could happen. In the state of Georgia the law is its illegal for drivers to have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support a phone. This is known as a hands free law. This still doesn't stop people from using their phones. More than 16 million users on snapchat have admitted to using the app to take photos and videos while operating a vehicle. According to traffic safety experts, engaging in any activity that takes your eyes off the road and your hands off the wheel puts both you and other motorists at risk. Is a text or snap really worth your life and everyone around you. Nothing is more important than the safety of you and those around you. Distraction only takes a few seconds. It can wait!

We all have those moments where we need to know where we are going. This doesn't mean we need to hold our phones. Car mounts are an easy way to make it hands free and allows your phone to be eye level.

Nowadays most cars have bluetooth to where you don't have to pick up your phone you can just use your voice. There are also new apps that parents can have so teenagers can't use their phones while driving. Apple also has a setting on their phones to where when you get a text it will automatically send a text saying you are driving and will respond when the car is not in any motion.

Damn, if it were me in a car crash I would be scared out of my life and praying to god I'm still alive. There's a lot of people who don't even cause the crash and end up getting really bad injuries just because of that one person who decided to choose a poor choice. Also, there's one more thing really traffic that can happen, and

Ramirez 2 that is death. The victim or yourself can end up dead in the car crash and that's something we don't happening.

Last one, it's more important to me in my opinion and is similar to the last one but with one more thing added to it. If you do get in that car crash for being on your phone and you have someone else in the car with you like a friend. You are going to have full responsibilities not only for yourself, but for your friend as well. Your friend's parents are going to have a lot to say not only to you but to your parents too. From there, you are going to cover the medical bills for yourself and for your friend too. Imagine all that money over a poor decision you made by texting someone back. That money could have been used for something good like for college, a new car, or new house.

In conclusion, please don't make the same mistakes people failed to do. Be smart about your decisions while being on the road. Never use your phone on the road or it could lead to bad things or even worse.      ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

I am disappointed in this common day society thinking that texting is more important than their lives. It's honestly sad that either drunk driving or texting while driving is more of a common issue of death than common reasons like strokes or heart attacks or natural causes like old age. Many people believe texting and driving isn't the issue it is the issue though people are just trying to ignorant to believe the lies that the media are teaching them but not me I am going to outshine the laws and not die from a car accident but rather old age when It's my time to go I will go not anytime early. But many people don't appreciate life until their stripped away from it instead of watching how they could've ended their lives within a status being known for something they did they disappear without people knowing who they really were. To any beginning drivers that are by themselves in the car without adult or guardian supervision pay attention especially late hours 8 Pm-4Am where you can't see that well outside use your taillights and headlights use turning signals when turning left or right or even merging in the lanes use your stopping signals when your about to make a stop at a red light and please put down the phones anyone who is texting and driving can wait till you get to your devastation safely.

Nowadays people are on their phones all the time on a daily basis, whether or not these should be allowed while driving is an easy answer. They shouldn't be allowed at all while driving for reasons I will state.

Phones are distracting. Phones aren't like other distractions they almost always require your full attention (unless it's calling). If your browsing social media while driving you're going to be reading what's on your phone rather than drive or you will be playing a game on your phone rather than watching the road you're watching the game. when your texting unless you know the keyboard like the back of your hand then you're going to make typos and grammar mistakes which will lead you to be glued to your screen to make a good text.

Phone use in general is just a bad idea. You aren't giving the road your full 100%

attention while using a phone and if you slip up and look at your phone for a second you can cause an accident. Some things while driving need split second reactions like, someone in front of you stopping without warning abruptly or a car swerving into your lane or a person walking onto the road, if you're on your phone while driving and any of these things happen you're sure to cause an accident or even worse kill someone.

To play devil's advocate the one caveat to this essay is calling. With Aux cords in virtually in every car and Bluetooth becoming more mainstream in more recent cars, you don't need to be holding a phone to call someone. You can do it all from your steering wheel with newer cars if you get a call while driving your car will accept the call and you can talk while not even touching the phone. While aux cords aren't as good as Bluetooth there still amazing at keeping you hand free, you can just pick up your phone while its hooked up to the car and pick it up and put your phone down while talking on the phone though the car.

In conclusion phones should not be used at all for things like that you need to be watching the road for anything that gets literally and figuratively thrown your way, phones are just straight up distracting and you should not be distracted while driving for reasons stated earlier and because it's just irresponsible the only exception to this is using an aux cord or

Texting and driving is never okay but that doesn't mean that phones should never be used while driving. There are beneficial uses of cellphones that allow drivers to get to their destination is a faster, happier way. Technology keeps advancing and is even included in newer cars or other vehicles. Not everyone has, or can afford a new car though. This means that they must rely on their phone for music, GPS, and emergency phone calls.

Music can be a big deal for drivers because in certain kinds of situations such as long drives. Long, extended drives causes drivers to not be able to focus on where they're supposed to be going, also called highway hypnosis. Music allows drivers to focus better and keep them attentive. It also keeps drivers in a good mood which causes less stress and road rage.

GPS is the most necessary reason for using a phone when the car doesn't have that kind of technology. GPS is safer than writing down directions or using a map. The driver doesn't have to look down at the phone either because most GPS services have a voice speaking out directions for them.

Sometimes drivers have absolute emergency phone calls that they must take. They don't have to put their phone up to their ear since there are other ways around it. Drivers could use the speaker option on their phone or Bluetooth. An emergency call could include calling the police for reckless drivers or crashes. Personal emergency calls include a wife going into labor or needing to take a detour to pick kids up from school.

Drivers should never text and drive, however there are still plausible uses for phones such as getting directions from GPS, listening to music as entertainment, and emergency phone calls for various reasons. Most reasons for phones are unnecessary especially with the technology provided in newer cars. If the driver has a car that has everything available, then their phone is not needed in their presence.

You have social media the bad and violence the games that's knocking sleep due to staying up on phones but what's worse is people try and use phones while driving. Not so good that can cause lots of problems and bad things to happen.

People in today's life does not worry about the consequences that can come their way later in life or right then and there. Anything can happen or go wrong while you on the phone and driving. I prefer if you do not be on the phone and driving at the same time. You can put your life or others life in bad shape while driving and on the phone. Especially the innocent lives should not be viewing bad things like that it is setting a bad influence on the kids and others in the situation.

Driving while on the phone is also illegal to do you can be sent to jail or killed during the bad decision. You can easily drift off of the highway and hit a car that's slowing down or anything you never know what could happen while on your cell phone and driving. Someone can be coming out of and parking lot you won't know because your busy on the phone and in the 5 seconds you on your phone boom ! just like that car crash or even worse. As I stated earlier, what if you have that innocent person with you and the person is injured due to what you have done.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become the importance of our life. People in this world use their phones for just about everything now there's no such thing as a dictionary or books because it's all in the phones. But, that doesn't give you rights or authority to be on your phone and harm someone else's life. I feel that it is very harmful in lots of ways.

It will be very important if you just stay off the cell phones until it's a great timing because driving and on your phone is not what you should do at anytime. I strongly agree that on your and driving is the most dangerous thing drivers can do on the road. Put the phones down and keep your eyes on the road at all times. Its key to being safe while on the road many people have died from car crashes and its best to avoid and accident like that. Stop the violence and stop texting and driving.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't cut the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they were talking to and that it doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call for when there is an emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in-car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is AirIQ. AirIQ is a service that if an accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while AIRIQ is always ready to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.

Worldwide over 1.6 million crashes happen each year. Nearly over 300 hundred k people are injured. From accidents caused by texting while driving. In the United States approximately 9 people are killed and over a thousand were injured in crashes because they were distracted. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents.

The driver can't have the phone touching them while on the phone. It must be on a hands free setup. Hand free stands are helpful. Plus you don't have to worry about getting pulled over.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

As technology development grows at an exponential rate and far more places have access to internet and phones, many people have begun to experience the benefits of globalization, meanwhile however, accidents on highways and freeways are on the rise as a direct result of people using their phones while operating motored vehicles, not only putting themselves in danger but others as well. This is an unsafe behavior that deserves great attention and society needs to come together to come up with a plan to prevent future accidents.

It is true that everyday more and more businesses conduct their activities online and most jobs require employees to be on their phones for a large amount of time, prospecting and client outreach may come at an unexpected time, and some may argue that the act of being the phone while driving is often times necessary to conduct business, this however comes at a great cost, and the risks associated with this behavior could be fatal according to experts at a local university in Kansas.

9 people are killed and more than 1,000 are injured daily in incidents reported as distraction-affected crashes in the United State (""FCC""), and in 2013 it was reported that, according to a national survey in the US, the number of drivers who reported using their cellphones to access the internet while driving had risen to nearly one of four. (""USA Today"")

The bottom line is that Phones and motored vehicles do not mix well and the action of using a cellular device while driving must be avoided.

You text Ron back and let him know you're driving ...or have a whole conversation with him trying to be a good parent and direct him to the medicine bag, again. Next thing you know flashing lights are behind you looking to give you ticket that ranges from 250$ to 2,750$ and if he doesn't he can be fined 11,000 dollars. Is it right to have cellular devices out while driving? Was this situation an acceptance? In this essay I will inform you on whether I believe having your devices out is wrong or right and have supporting facts and details.

What are possible reasons when driving with a cellphone? There are at least 3 if you're a service driver and you need (directions). Two is in case of last minute call (urgent phone-call). Three, if your receiving an important phone call.

These still aren't acceptable to the law tho. In the state of Georgia having a phone in your hands leads you straight to a ticket. I say these three things because I agree but because it's known that everybody does this out of Bad habit, it's going to happen. An average of 62.9 percent of the world owned a cellphone in the year 2016. Cellphones and he internet is a fast growing thing these days, some people can't keep away from them, but that doesn't mean it's okay to use them while driving there's a time and a place for that. I don't agree with those that use their cellphones incorrectly while driving. Technology is growing and the world has to learn how to adapt to it in safer matters, not texting and driving or taking selfies behind the wheel. There really aren't any real good excuses for being on it all the time while driving, there's built in GPS, and Bluetooth so for those reasons I said are acceptable aren't. Maybe the if it's in your hand ticket things a little too far but safety first.

Cellphones and driving is risky and has a bad effect to the world. 1 out of 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the united states. An estimated amount of 1.6million car crashes happen a year from it. Almost 390,000 injuries a year happen leaving people paralyzed when people text and drive with a high death rate. The fines and jail time aren't nice especially in bad cases. Those aren't acceptable numbers or is it worth the risk, don't expect your insurance to save you either.

Cell phones have evolved in our society everyday in which case its made a huge impact in our daily lives. Technology has grown dramatically over the years. The majority of people own a cell phone in which they use on a day to day basis including while driving. Even though it is not authorized people still tend to do so. Drivers should not be able to use or operate any type of cell phones or any form of technology in which case it can be very dangerous. In our society people have been so focused on trying to do multiple things all at once that we are willing to risk our own lives and others safety.

Texting, calling or reading messages while driving can easily lead to a car crash. Keeping your eyes off the road for less than 5 seconds can cost you or somebody else's life. According to The National Safety Council states that cell phone use while driving leads up to 1.6 million crashes each year. There's actual statistics that shows that 26 percent of people driving say have admitted to texting while driving (Teens and Distracted Driving). These are just some facts that prove using your phone while driving can become a major threat to our community. Did you know that teenage drivers are four times more likely to be involved in a car crash than adult drivers? It is causing insurance to increase and causes concerns for others health.

Throughout time humans have always tried to multitask simply because nowadays in order to get a job, cook, work, or have kids you need to know how to do multiple things all at once. Yet, humans are naturally not great at multitasking. While driving your main priority is to focus on driving and just driving; if people were actually good at multitasking than ""texting while driving"" rates of deaths wouldn't be extremely high as it is now. According to American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) traffic crashes are the #1 cause of death and injury for people ages 16-20, with more than 5,600 teens dying in motor vehicle collisions each year. While being behind the wheel you need to be inventive, always look at your surroundings, all mirrors, and everywhere.

Texting while driving is threatening because you see it all the time yet, people still don't change their bad habits. If it wasn't harmless than there would've been any commercials of people getting into car crashes on the television nor either any signs stating ""no texting while driving."" The rates of using a cellular device are so high that statistics show that driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. The U.S. bans text messaging. There are three main types of distractions which are visual, manual, and cognitive. Texting while driving uses all three of these distractions in which it will cost you a life including jail time all because humans can't put the phone down for a few minutes. The U.S. bans text messaging so don't even try to do it.

In conclusion, humans should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. Simple facts and statistics show us textual evidence in how texting while driving is life threatening. As we know, numbers don't lie. There over 1 million car crashes each year; not only that but we live it everyday and watch how innocent lives are taken away day by day because of cellular devices. Save a life. It can most definitely wait. A life is not worth a text or a call.

Smartphones make it easy for us to be connected with friends and family through phone calls, text messages, etc. How do you feel about the use of cellphones while driving? Well, about 660,000 drivers attempt using a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Rates for cell phone distractions are extremely high. Do you think that it would be okay to use cellphones while driving? I feel that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it affects their ability to drive, causes car accidents and people die.

People's driving could easily be affected by the use of a cell phone. It can be a distraction physically and cognitively. The physical distraction occurs when they are using the cellphone while driving their vehicle. Cognitive distraction occurs when drivers give their attention to the phone instead of the road. However, the ability to give your attention to both of these tasks are limited.

Statistics show that driving and using a cellphone is more common for which can be very dangerous. According to ""National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes each year. 341,000 involved text messaging, and 1.2 million involed drivers talking on the phone. The statistics show that this multitasking while operating a vehicle is becoming life threatening. Research from ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)""

says, teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any throwbacks. If they don't use their phones they would be able to pay attention to driving, be less likely to have a crash, most importantly, they would be following the law.

Car crashes end up causing very fatal injuries and death. Driving while texting is 6 times more likely to cause car crashes than driving while intoxicated. There are nearly 390,000 injuries caused by texting and driving yearly. Approximately 6,000 people were killed by texting and driving in the past year. Checking a text takes 5 seconds of a driver's attention away from driving when they could be used on the road.

Overall, I feel that using a cellphone while driving shouldn't be allowed because it causes car accidents affects driving and kills people. 1.6 million car accidents, 1 out of 4 of them yearly involves texting while driving. This could be changed. Limit your cellphone use. Just think how many lives can be saved. Think of the car crash rate, they will dwindle. Before driving and after check your phone.

Drivers preoccupied by non-driving activities are prone to causing an accident. Therefore, the use of cell phones has been one of the main contributors to car accidents. However, many States have rightfully stopped local governments from prohibiting cell phone use by motorist, and they have enforced strict rules to control their usage. For example, driving a state vehicle a person can be terminated if caught texting and talking on a cell phone. The National Safety Council also estimates that in a recent year, 21% of vehicular crashes (1,100,000) involved talking on either a handheld or hands free cell phone. About 6,000 deaths and a half a million injuries are caused by distracted drivers every year.

If you are driving at 55mph for 5 seconds in that amount of time you could cross a football field. People don't understand how dangerous distracted driving really is. All states should have some sort of legal parameters of what happens when you get caught using your cell phone while driving. Drinking while driving laws are much harsher than distracted driving. The Arizona state laws states: "" if you are under the age of 21 any trace of alcohol, illegal drugs or drugs that impair your ability to drive safely will result in stiff penalties and your license will be suspended for two years."" As you can see the laws have bigger consequences.

a good alternative to prevent cell phone distraction would be to put the phone in the glove compartment. Relevant phone messages can always be retrieved after you arrive at your destination. some people might say that banning cell phone usage while driving is similar to banning a person from tuning the radio or lighting a cigarette while driving.

Surprisingly people are using them at the wrong times, causing car accidents and other accidents. Driving while texting or even talking sometimes on the phone is not safe at all. All of this makes it extremely hard to focus on the road and your surroundings.

Therefore, since driving and texting is illegal, and people still do it, there are now fines and tickets people have to pay if they are caught or even suspected to be on their phone while driving. Most drivers cannot maintain the same speed when they aren't focused on the road so the other drivers will either be so close to them or get mad and speed around them. There have been reports of 36% of drivers who admit to being on their phones while driving. 14% of that 36% ended up in a deadly wreck.

Billions of people throughout the world are using cell phones in daily routine life. Cell phones provide communication with greater flexibility. It is, nowadays considered less fashion and more a utility providing several benefits. Cell phones have different features in addition to communication including cameras, video games, music, FM receivers etc. Cell phones not only facilitate business and personal convenience they also provide comfort and safety. However, observations, experience, and studies all have highlighted the dangerous effects of using cell phones during driving, strictly unadvisable, and an illegal matter. The major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts attention of driver. (Scotti, 2007)

There are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention. They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating at the same time that increases threats to safety. Furthermore, drivers has also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance. (Gravelle, 2005)

Despite offering huge benefits, cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers using cell phones are not able to give their complete attention on roads exposing not only themselves but also other people on the road. Therefore, most of the governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Greece, Germany, and different Asian as well as African countries, have imposed restriction on using cell phones during driving.

Because of diversion in attention drivers reacts slowly to the traffic signals, missing them at times. Decision making during driving is a critical factor giving drivers fraction of a second to make a swift decision about a given complex scenario. Studies have highlighted those drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decision causing serious accidents involving other vehicles also. (Gravelle, 2005)

Drivers demonstrates comparatively slower braking responses and also had low awareness of other traffic flowing through the roads ignoring their presence concentrating more on cell phones and less on roads as how other drivers are behaving. Different studies have reported hundreds of deaths during a year because of using cell phones during driving.

Increased Chances of Fatal Accidents

Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. (Gravelle, 2005)

The main advantage to avoid using cell phone during driving is ensuring safety of driver, vehicle, and other people driving on the road. By making conversation, writing messages, or just playing with the mobile increases the chances of accidents. It is pertinent to highlight that hands-free phones have also similar negative impacts during driving; both distracts attention, although hands-free cell phones do not require manual handling. (Sturnguist, 2006)

The nature of conversation on cell phones during driving differs and can have distinctive impacts on drivers. The complexity of conversation draws more attention of drivers, while simple or casual conversation is less distracting, however, both may produce same consequences. As such, the more complex a situation is higher are chances of distraction that presents a threat to road safety. (Klein, 2000)

Cell phone users while driving has low level of perceptions. There exists a direct relationship between perception and performance of a driver. Distracted attention results in low perception of the driver reducing performance levels. A major strength of driving skills is a pro-active approach anticipating actions of other drivers and making adjustments accordingly. However, a driver busy in conversation on a cell phone is unable to adopt a pro-active approach and it becomes almost impossible to anticipate other person's attitude as well as behavior. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death. (Gravelle, 2005)

Some Benefits of Cell Phones during Driving

Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic. (Sturnguist, 2006)

Conclusion

The paper has presented arguments on both sides of the issue using or not using cell phones during driving. On the basis of arguments presented in the paper, it can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

Cell phone usage while driving isn't very safe at all. When you are using it, you aren't really paying attention to the road. It's a safety hazard with a lot of people driving and using their phone. In the united states alone, just fifteen years ago, there were only 4.3 million people that use cell phones. Today there are 224 million people that use them as of now. Your cell phone gets used everywhere you go such as the shopping and trying to find the item you need or even when you are making a list to go to the store to buy school supplies. People talk on their phones everyday while they drive or even around the house to keep in contact with others.

In several cases, drivers have been in a lot of accidents and it's been, because of their cell phone and people sue either you or your insurance company depending on the accident and what happens. People also have been held liable for the accidents involving their phone, because they were the one that wasn't paying attention and was distracted. Cells are convenient for people, but they don't know how to properly use them. Begin on your phone is so dangerous and people need to understand it's not really that important to be on your phone while you're driving unless something is really wrong then you need to pull over and find out what's going on.

In the united states they have a law called ""hands free"". When your being on your phone while your driving is a distraction that lead to fatal consequences. The consequences aren't normally very good, because when an accident happens and you were on your phone you can be sued very badly and you'll probably be in trouble and struggle with money. Its best if all drivers will stay off their phones while they drive. In the end of the day there are a lot of people dying in accidents, because of distracted drivers. So always pay attention to the road while you're driving and don't be on your phone.

In the end its always smart to not be on your phone while you drive. Use your phone when you at a complete stop or if it's safe to. If everyone would work on this the accident percentage wouldn't be so high in the united states.                  ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

90BC4A0EDED0,"Imagine checking the notification of your cell phone and in the blink of an eye you get into a car accident.Texting and driving is the act of texting, checking social media, composing a message,emailing, or using the internet while driving a vehicle.Texting and driving is an issue that has resulted in car crashes and even death. Picking up a phone while you are behind the wheel could put yourself and others in danger. People should be cautious and know the risk of picking up a cell phone while they are driving.Cell phones have become and is a very big distraction. Drivers should not be able to use them or even have them in their hand,lap, or etic while they are in the act of operating a vehicle.

The cell phone has become so much of a distraction to the point where people are immune to picking up their phone every time they receive a notification. The disturbance of a notification on the phone has been the cause of man accidents and deaths caused by car wrecks. Statistics show 6 out of 10 teenegers have been in car crashes due to distracted driving. In the text located on www.teensafe.com it shares the story of 25 year old Natasha Boggs of Ohio and how texting and driving affected her life and others. It states "" Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving.""The article also tells the story of 20 year old Dillon Jackson a pickup truck driver that was distracted by his cell phone which took other innocent lives. The text states ""A driver of a pickup truck killed a whopping 13 individuals in a Texas crash in the spring of 2017. 20-year-old Jack Dillon Young was behind the wheel of his truck and was texting while driving, causing him to cross the center line several times.""

This informs you on how cell phone distraction could risk the lives of not only yourself but others as well. ? people are injured or killed due to cell phone distraction. Cell phone disturbances have a big impact on car crashes and deaths.

Cell phone distractions are very dangerous when someone is operating a vehicle. Distracted driving can include things like eating, drinking, talking to others while driving, and etc. Out of all those distractions cell phone interaction is the most common and dangerous. When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says "" Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes."" This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that ""4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind."" When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving.

People should consider certain things before picking up a phone. Things can be done to lower the accidents caused by the distraction of a cell phone. Companies have taken a huge step to decrease the number of wrecks caused by phones.Cell phone companies such as AT&T realized how big cell phones are distractions to drivers so they come up with programs. For example, a big program today is "" It could wait "". On the site www.independentmotors.com it describes the can wait program. It quotes ""AT&T itself has helped drive these conversations with its It Can Wait campaign, which has seen more than 7 million people take the campaign's pledge to drive more safely. The company also launched its DriveMode app, which keeps all phone calls and texts quiet while you are driving. The app turns on automatically when it detects that the user is moving faster than 15 MPH and turns off shortly after it detects that the user has stopped.""

This shows how companies have noticed the danger of cell phones and have taken action onto fixing it such just like AT&T which is a huge cell phone company. Another program example is the Stop Texting AND Driving Distracted, or STANDD program. This program was launched by a lady who lost her son due to a texting a driving incident . The website states "" Like a few other organizations on this list, STANDD has its own app for iOS and Android smartphones. It starts up as soon as your engine does, and as long as you're moving more than 10 miles per hour, the free app deactivates any texts and calls that you receive, letting the caller know that you're unavailable with an auto-message."". This goes to show that there are ways to put an end to all the horrible incidents caused by texting and driving but it is all up to you. Programs have been made, apps have been released, and signs are around you everyday to remind you not to text and drive so do what's best and focus more on the road and not on your phone.

A simple message or text could wait. If people paid as much attention to the roads than their phones there would be less wrecks or car tragedies. Cell phones are huge distractions on drivers. Drivers are put in harm once they pick up their phones to check a text, post on social media, change songs, make videos, and etc. Cell phones while driving is like taking a risk. People are put in life or death situations once being distracted by their phones when operating a vehicle. In conclusion the use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving.

DBD87F1C44C6,"Today the majority of people use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of us just can't put them down, not even when it can cause other people to be unsafe. We use them from when we wake up to when we finally go to sleep. But is there a time that we shouldn't be on our cell phones? When we're driving it is never a good idea to be on your phone.

The reason that its a bad idea to be on your phone during driving is that it takes away your attention from the road. Driving is already a multitasking operation. We have to balance our speed, gas level, directions, music, air conditioning, and other drivers. The last thing we need is another thing to focus on, especially an entertainment device that we already struggle to put down. All cell phones do for drivers is add another thing to focus on, and the list of things for drivers to focus on is already too long.

Another reason not to allow phones in the hands of drivers is that, although distraction is a large issue, even if you argue that you can pay attention and multitask well enough, your reaction time is still slowed. It has been proven that multitasking lowers a person's ability to act efficiently. This also applies to driving. Not only do you run the risk of missing a turn or passing that restaurant that you were looking for, you run a very large risk of not reacting soon enough to a distracted driver, running off of the road, and rear ending a stopping car. Your slowed reaction time is a very large issue when using cell phones while driving.

The reasons for not using cell phones while driving are very compelling and should not be taken lightly. Many people lose their lives every year due to distracted driving. It is important to stay very focused and aware while driving. Do not risk your safety or someone else's due to cell phone usage while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Distractions can serve as a curse and a blessing. Not giving full attention to what we should be doing makes us miss deadlines, fail classes and crash into other drivers. Distractions sure comes with a price! Mobile phone use while driving is a particularly important form of driver distraction. It can increase the risk of traffic accidents by up to four times.

Our brains have a limited ability to focus. We can't pay attention to everything around us at once so we must choose what to focus on. For instance, while driving we are supposed to keep our eye on the road , but as soon as our phones chime the brain automatically wants to check the phone ,taking your focus off the road and to the distraction which can cause you to crash into other drivers. Due to our brains ability to focus on one thing at a time NO driver should be allowed to have a mobile device while driving a motor vehicle.

Talking on a cell phone may be less distracting than some other activities people may engage in while driving. Sadly, some people still don't get this one. Alcohol has an effect on your motor skills and judgment, meaning you just simply just cannot drive and be intoxicated at the same time .Research shows an increased risk of death for drivers who have been distracted by their phones checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Even though phones can cause a distraction your focus should be on the road. Therefore, drivers should not be allowed to use phones or be under any kind of influence while driving.

To conclude, no drivers should be allowed to have an operating mobile device while driving simply because your brain won't be able to process a car and a phone at the same time. Driving can be dangerous business. Every year, a shocking number of people lose their life or are severely injured while traveling in vehicles. Leave your phone in your pocket or purse and take it out once the car is stopped. Save your life and the text.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
E1DF5A240860,"I think it should be designed by teachers. The reason why it should be teachers designed, is that if the students need help on the project the teachers would know how to help.

Teachers help students a lot with providing information that they need to complete their assignments. There was this one times my friend Generic_Name needed help on his projects he kept over thinking that he had to much,or that it might not be enough. But when he ask the teacher for assistants Mr Generic_Name help show him the things that he needed,and don't need. Once Mr Generic_Name showed him Generic_Name felt better about his project

Teachers have more knowledge than students. To became a teacher you have to go to college and get your degree. And they have already went through the process,of being a students in school. For and example my Grandmother used to all ways tell me I didn't know more than her because she have been living on these earth more than me and she was right because I haven't. She have been a students before she had to do same things I have to do.

The reason why it shouldn't be a student designed is because most kids now a day just copy and paste anything from google and don't put no thought into hard working

That's why you should pick teachers design they have more knowledge and training.",3,Summer projects,Independent
59B8A753F73F,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects range from all sorts of different styles and designs. Some people argue that these assignments should be teacher-designed so it is more detailed and challenging. Others argue that it should be student-designed so its better for the student. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it, students will be more passionate about it, and teacher-designed projects take away freedom.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students will learn better from it. People learn better when they do things themselves. If students have the ability to choose how to do their project, then they can learn from their mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn which makes student-designed projects the best way to learn. Furthermore, its helps students overcome obstacles. When students are doing their projects they will run into troubles. If the project is student-designed, they will have to overcome these obstacles themselves and help them grow academically. To sum it up, student-designed projects help students learn from mistakes and help them overcome obstacles.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be more passionate about it. Students will do their project if they can choose what its on. If students can choose the subject of the project they will be more likely to do it because they are interested in what it is about. If the project is something they do not care about, they will not complete the assignment. Students will have more fun doing the project. If students can choose the subject of the project they will likely choose something they are interested in. If the subject of the project is something the student enjoys, they will have a great time doing it. To sum it up, student-designed projects will encourage students to complete the assignments and students will have a good time doing it.

Summer projects should be student-designed because teacher-designed projects takes away a student's freedom. Teacher's get to choose everything. Teacher's get to choose what assignments students receive throughout the whole school year. Students should get the chance to be free and choose what they want. Furthermore, Students should get the choice of how the project gets done. Students have to take time out of their vacation to complete their summer project. Since they're using their own time, they should at least get to decide how to do their project. To sum it up, student-designed projects give students the freedom to learn what they want to learn.

Student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed projects because they help students learn better by making them overcome obstacles. Students are also more passionate about it and it gives them the freedom to do what they want. Students don't get the chance to choose many things, but summer projects should be something they get to complete the way they want.",4,Summer projects,Independent
C54DFE18A444,"Summer projects keep the mind sharp. However often tedious, summer projects can often be beneficial as it can prepare the students for the following year or preferebly life. Some believe that these projects should be teacher designed so that students have the base kowledge on what will be covered that year, however that's not what learning is about. Learning is a life long journey not a journey to the next test. If these summer projects were student designed, where students had the freedom to choose, they could work on a something they truly found interesting. These projects could give them life experience rather than school experience.

Firstly, these summer projects can be anything from work experiece to writing a noval. For example if a student loved to write and thought they may have a carreer as a jounalist or even an author they may decide their time was best spent on sharpening those skills. Not only would their time be spent to make themselves a better writer but also they would excited to do the work. However what if a student decides to make their project a job or even an internship at some law firm, well that is even better. These students will come back to school with more maturity, life experience and perhaps some money in the bank.

Another outcome of student designed summer projects is rather than coming back the school with dred and resentment, they'll come back excited to showcase what they've learned. For example if teachers assigned a massive work load on everything they might need to pass the tests during the year, students will be anxious, unmotivated and stressed by the first day of school. This would kill students desire to learn and cause resentment towards teachers. However, if students can come back to school with the confidence that they are able to learn and experiece things by themselves, students will come into school postive and inspired to learn rather than being negative and unmotivated.

Finally, there is a difference between schooling and learning. Schooling is a soley a tool to educate individuals however it is temporary. Learning is rather a life long jouney, something that should never stop. There is learning before school such as when you learned to walk and talk for the first time and then there is learning after school when you get a job or simply when you read a book. That is why summer projects should be the students responsibility, so that they can learn to learn by themselves. Sadly too many students believe that learning and schooling are the same thing and their life long jouney ends once they leave school.

In conclusion, summer projects should be the students responsibility. These summer projects should inspire students to learn and experience new things. The goal is to have students motivated when they return to school rather than stressed and anxious for the year to end. Lastly learning is a life long jouney, schooling is temporary.",5,Summer projects,Independent
48A79347EF59,"Summer assignments are never fun and many students can agree with that statement. Even though they are beneficial to continue your learning throughout your break. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers of the course due to the fact that they are familiar with the curriculum, they understand what is needed to be tested on throughout the course, and the teacher knows what the students are capable of doing.

Teachers are familiar with the curriculum and know what needs to be on your assignment to ensure that you are successful in the class. The teachers have learned that topic and are experts on the subject. Going to a college and receiving a higher education in a certain topic makes the professor best fit to decide what you should learn during your break off from school. For example in a AP Human Geography class the summer assignment was to fill in maps of the world and fill out chapter guides for the first two units. In doing this the students became familiar with the content which makes them more likely to receive a higher grade and a better understanding of the unit. This proves that when the teacher designs the assignment they are leading you to become more familiar and successful in your learning.

Teachers know what is being tested in a course and what is expected for the student to know. Teachers have to teach certain things to the students while following a guideline. This tells the teacher what the student should know by the end of the year. By giving the students a summer assignment that lets them be ahead and know certain topic then it benefits the students and makes them receive a better understanding of the curriculum. In most courses there are online resources that allow the teacher to know what should be taught by the end of the year and what should be taught in a certain state. This helps the teacher decide what the summer assignments should be. Some students may think that a student-designed assignment would be easier and more beneficial. This is incorrect due to the fact that the students aren't familiar with the subject or what needs to be taught. The students also aren't responsible enough to decide what needs to be learned over their break.

Teacher understand the students position since they were all in the same place at a certain point in time, therefore they will assign what they know the student is capable of doing without overwhelming them. The teacher will give the student a doable amount of work that will benefit them without stressing and overwhelming them. A teacher that taught AP Human Geo at a high school understood that students wanted a break from school and they didn't want to do useless work that wouldn't help them. Therefore he gave them a good amount of work that they could finish and learn from.

Summer assignments should be teacher-designed due to the fact that teachers understand the students and understand the curriculum so they can balance an assignment that benefits the students. Teachers are more familiar with the subject and know what the students will be tested on, therefore the assignments will have a good purpose. Teachers should make the assignments because they are experts on the topics and have the students interests at heart so they can help them.",5,Summer projects,Independent
63382FEE34A7,"Summer projects are something a student always dreads during vacation, maybe your at the pool and you remember that you have to do a research paper for your science class that has to be turned in on the first day of school. So you get ready to work on it but you dont know what to do it on and you get stuck since your supposed to choose the topic and the format your research paper is going to be in. Giving students the opportunity to design there own project is good, but students forget so much during vacations that they have no prior knowldedge or forget how to do certain things. This is why Teacher designed projects during the summer are a better idea then student designed projects. Since students can understandably be too busy enjoying there vacation they can forget how to do certain things or have problems making decisions for there projects. on the other hand if teachers design these projects they can make a rubric on what to include points, topics, and even examples and if any students are confused they can just email the teacher. Ive had experience with a teacher designed project or assignment and it turned out way easier then I thought it would be even when I had difficulties me and my teacher were able to work out a solution so I could finish the project.

Summer vacation for students is a time to relax go travel or visit other family members maybe get ready for a summer sport. Most students wont even think about there work until the last month of vacation when this happens thats when students start to panic. Projects can also be hard if a student goes out of country for the summer and doesnt have acess to technology at all times and struggle to create a project that gets high points. Even if students have acess to technology, during large gaps like summer vacation students can tend to forget many things they learned during the school year since they arent really learning anything. Students are more likely to get a better grade on there projects if they are given certain tasks that they have to do to complete there project so that they dont stress out over the work they have to do.

In comparison Teacher designed projects can be easier to follow since most teachers will leave specific directions that you have to accomplish. This takes away from the stress of coming up with something yourself and sometimes wasting time looking for the right topics. Teacher projects can vary depending on classes like for instance an English might make you read a book then give a report on it and they give you a series of books that you can choose from. Most Teacher projects have a goal or something they want you to accomplish ,so its really clear what they want you to do and how to execute it to get the best grade possible. Reaffirming my statement most teachers will give a rubric or packet to show what you have to do and maybe even examples so you can have a better idea of what they want from you. This method can give students a clear picture of what they need to do and they can plan what work they should complete now and which to do later. Even then students might still be confused so if they really are stuck they can just email the teacher since most teachers will give there email before summer break begins just in case students have questions.

I had a experience with my AP government teacher where before the class had even started he had left us a assignment/project to do. He explained that this project was so we could start the year sprinting and fly through the first couple of units so we could get to the important topics about government. I went travelling to visit my family in Canada and didnt start doing the project until there was a month left. everything seemed pretty easy by itself and everything was clear, but I was supposed to print the the documents after I had finished completing them and I didnt have a printer. I was able to email him to see what I could do and he recomended I just answer the documents in paper and to just hand it to him when school started. i was able to have a nice summer and still do the work and when school came by i was able to give him the work.

Even though teacher designed projects are a bit easier and straight to the point it doesnt give you much option to be creative or do much else. Student projects can be more fun and give a greater sense of purpose since your choosing what your going to do for your project. This gives room to people who are really passionate and creative about theyre topic and they create amazing things. by putting restrictions and limiting the ammount that these people can do it makes them feel less motivated and makes it seem like they are just doing simple work instead of doing something special. this can hurt them and maybe even make them lose interest in the class that they generally like.

In conclusion even though Student projects offer more purpose Teacher designed projects are more simpler and easier to understand so students dont have to stress when they are in vacation. Teachers provide clear directions and can offer help when needed so students can focus on being with there familys and relax. Students can have a rough time doing there projects if they are given vague instructions for doing it and they end up wasting time and not making a good final product. From my experience i was able to complete my work and work through troubles I had with my teacher so I do believe that Summer projects should be Teacher designed. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
95B8CF43E670,"Summer projects have become a cultural norm within the school system. These projects have been created and mandated by the teachers. It can be vigorous and also very flexible depending on the teachers idea of what they believe you should do. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project.

Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom. Generic_Name, a student at Generic_School, completes vigorous sports and extra curricular activities during summer and, also has 5 different classes with summer assignments. Generic_Name has designed a workload that he can complete while leaving free time but, his teachers have designed summer projects that completely wipe out all his free time. Generic_Name should be able to design a summer project that works for his schedule and, should not be told by his teachers what to do on his only long term break from those teachers. Another student, named Generic_Name, wishes to be engaged during her time off but does not want the burden of having her summer break destroyed by teachers who try to maximize their workload during the time off. She wants to be able to create a project that minimizes her time learning but that keeps her engaged during the break so that she is ready to come back. By mandating what students do outside of school limits their freedom during a time where they should be on a break from school; This totally destroys the whole idea of summer being a break and a time to de-stress by constantly stressing students to finish summer projects. Students want freedom during the summer, this is why projects should be student designed.

Also, summer projects should be student designed because it keeps the students interested in their project. A 12th grade student, named Generic_Name, is being told by his teacher that he must read the book, the odyssey, during his summer break but, Generic_Name has no interest in that book what so ever. Students should have the ability to chose which book they read, if any. If a teacher tells a student they must read a novel over summer, they can choose a book that interests them so it makes it easier and, ultimately more fun for the student. A 9th grader, named Generic_Name is required to complete an 100 question math summer packet during her time off. She has AD/HD and struggles to stay focused for long periods of time, especially in things that do not interest her. By allowing her to complete online practice using a math app, it will keep her engaged and will allow her to make sure she is doing these problems correctly. Teachers mandating what students do and how they do it may interest the teacher but, a majority of the time, will bore the student and can actually lead to a regression in their skills. If students can design their own summer project that keeps them interested, it ultimately leads to more participation and effectiveness among students.

Furthermore, Summer projects should be student designed because it allows for more flexibility within their project. For example, Generic_Name, a student athlete, plays on one of the highest ranked women's lacrosse teams in the country, she has practice and workouts during the weekdays and a tournament every single weekend. Generic_Name was assigned a 400 page book to read but can never find the time nor the energy to read that much. By allowing her to chose, for example, an 150 page book, she can find enough time and energy to stay focused, and be able to complete the book. If students are not allowed the ability to design their projects it tends to become more of a pain to the student, rather than help. It tends to stress students more, especially those with vigorous schedules, during a time created for students to take a break. An 11th grade Spanish teacher, Generic_Name, sends out a summer assignment that requires students to go out and use Spanish in the real world. What would be considered to most students as an easy task, some students are not comfortable with this and would rather do book work at home where they feel more comfortable. A one size fits all plan does not work for every student, some need hands on learning, some need to listen to instruction and be taught directly to, and some students need to read and do book work. The idea that one assignment will fit every students needs and allow them to complete it quickly and efficiently will quite frankly never work. This type of flexibility is what students need out of summer projects and, they should be designed by the students.

Summer projects should be student designed because it allows kids to have more freedom, it keeps the students interested in their project, and allows for more flexibility within their project. Every student is a different learner with different advantages and disadvantages and, projects should be made to meet those students needs or they will either not complete it, or complete it while gaining nothing from it. Students know what they need and should not be completely controlled by teachers who think they know whats best for them. The student knows themselves better than anyone else in the world so they should be able to design their own summer projects.     ",6,Summer projects,Independent
4A55B9B42D20,"Many teachers assign summer projects to students to ensure that the child is still school focused throughout all the fun summer activities. Even though, majority of students hate the words ""summer and project"" together, giving them lead way to design their project is the best way to go. Students would have a chance to gain responsibility, be creative and make an easy grade.

Firstly, giving students the lead way to design their project allows the individual to gain responsibility. The student would be obligated to make time for all the steps leading up to the final project, making them move their schedule around or cancel plans. This ties into being an adult, making sacrifices to get important things done. For example, a students gets a summer project, its a Friday night and his or her friends wants them to go out. Instead of being behind on the project from going out, simply saying no and staying in to miss out on the fun is a sacrifice to the student. Therefore, creating responsibility from the ultimatum.

Secondly, letting students take lead way is the best option because it allows the student to actually be creative. Students get boring topics and assignments all the time, causing them to do poorly strictly because they dont find interest on the topic. However, giving students the free will design the project based on their interests while also being school related will definitely give a change in the result of the final project versus a random teacher designed project. For example, a teacher gives a random topic she designed to the student. The student gets a topic about plants, which the student knows nothing about while also having little to none interest about them. As a result, the student is not going to give their full potential on the project because they did not have interest on the forced topic.

Lastly, letting students design their summer project will give students the ability to bring their grade up. By students being creative and going the extra mile to have a successful project will give them the the perfect opportunity to make a great grade. For example, while doing the summer project the students will have confidence in the topic. While doing research the student will know exactly what they want to look for and even have a small plan on how they'd like the final outcome of the project to be. Resulting in a confident, well put together project.

However, some teachers might argue that allowing the students to design their summer project wouldn't be an excellent idea. Teachers may say that students would give no effort because they do have lead way on their project or it may be overwhelming for the student to make a decision on what they wanted their topic to be. However, letting the student have the option to choose their topic would not allow the student to not give effort or any creativeness. The topic would only be designed by the student and what their personal skill level is, leaving them to set their own boundaries up based on what they prefer.

In result, when summer rolls around and summer projects are assigned, letting students get the opportunity to design their project gives them responsibility by making simple or grand decisions, an open door to the students creative limits, and also makes great pay off from all the hard work and dedication gone into the project. So next time a teacher assigns a boring topic, students should take the lead and make a astonishing grade.",4,Summer projects,Independent
965C95685E5C,"Throughout my adolescent past, I've had a vigorous number of summer assignments. Whether it was a Algebra 1 packet or a summer reading assignment, teachers never fail to overwhelm there students with work before the year even begins. Most summer assignments are enforced by the teachers and lack any student input. A majority of students show little interest in the assignments they are presented and approach the work with a negative attitude rather than optimism. Although a student-designed summer project is a chance for students to exhibit there work in a more enjoyable fashion, a teacher-designed project would work better because teachers understand what work will best prepare students and shows the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.

A reason why teachers should design the projects is because they understand what work will best prepare students. Many teachers have attained an advanced education in there subject. Unlike the students, the teacher knows exactly what the course will consist of, and the level of difficulty that they will cover. In most classes, students start the year with no prior knowledge of the subject they will cover. An example of there unpreparedness is that large portions of high school students switch out of classes because they don't know the level of the work that they will be covering. A student led project could be void of any important information. If they find an area of the subject thats more difficult than the others, they could address that area more than another part of the subject. Assignments created by teachers would be a prime opportunity for teachers to demonstrate the work they will cover, and help a student drop the class if the work seems too challenging. A summer assignment is before the year starts, so switching your classes wouldn't interrupt your school year.

Another reason teachers should design the projects is because it shows what type of assignments will follow in the future. Teachers are a people of habit. Throughout the year, they will assign projects that are very similar to each other, following similar guidelines. An example of repetition in school is teachers assigning a variation of slide show presentations. Throughout the school year, many teachers conduct slide show presentations within new concepts. If a student were to design the summer project, it could be an entirely different format then any format suggested by a teacher. With the teacher in control, they could give you a project very similar to one that you may face in the future.

Many believe that if enjoy what your doing, than you will be more productive. A student getting to choose what type of project they will do could introduce the topic in more exciting manner. While enjoying what you do is important, it may also not prepare a student to the best of it's capabilities. A student led project may not cover the ground that it needs to cover. For example, the students could decide to write a one paragraph reflection on an area of the subject that they found interesting. The problem with that format is that it may only tackle a small portion of the subject, and you wouldn't be able to reflect on what others found interesting, which would help you remember the information better.

The teachers should design the project that the students work on. They know what work will best to prepare students and help them succeed. Teachers understand the subject far greater than any student designing the project. A more rigorous area of the subject could be addressed more in the project. If the teacher creates all of the future projects, than the summer project could reflect the type of projects teachers will assign in the future. Repetition is prominent within classrooms, and a summer assignment created by the teacher could offer incite into future projects. With a student in control of the project, they may only address a small area of the subject that will come up later in the year. While a student-designed summer project can make there work more enjoyable, a teacher-designed project would be better for students, because teachers understand what will prepare them best and is a way to discover the type of projects teachers will assign in the future.     ",5,Summer projects,Independent
AF9079B5EF21,"some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure that kids are still learning over the summer. Leaving only one question should the projects be designed by teachers or the students. Now letting a teacher design a project over the summer rather than the student will only be like homework. Therefore you shouldnt let the teachers design it because if you have homework over the summer just like over the year nine times out of ten your not going to do it. But that does not change the fact that if a student was to design his project he or she would most likely get it done better and get it done more quicker if their designing it themselves. Then again some students may have trouble designing projects themselves. Therefore I do think teachers should design a version of the project for students that that really have the creativity or thought process to get done all on there own.

Just imagine a student at home over the summer time he or she just getting out of school, going on break for two and a half months. think about what a student is going to go threw if a teacher designs a project and assign it to them. It will be way easier for the students to design there project the way they want it to be. For one there doing it over break which means the quicker he or she gets the out the way and done the better. So letting students design their own projects would better for the staff, students, and school. Making a student do teachers work over a break like the summer just isnt going to work because, if a student doesnt get the concept of the project that the teacher assigned then how is he other than looking it up on the internet which does not answer all question. Allowing students to actually get creative and design it them selves can actually help there knowledge in school and the real world. Then to go on and start the next year with good grades rather coming into a class room with an excuse because you where confused on what the teacher said.

working on a project while on summer break may be hard if you got to think of it all by yourself. But not only will you have to think for your self you will have to think about how the teacher actually want this project done. I know that you'll have to worry about how the teachers want it done anyways but in this case the student will have the advantage of designing the project themselves rather than having the teacher design cause any confusion. Because confusions lead to stress and stress results end with you not doing your project. which in that case you can say that it could really happen both ways but the point is that designing a project over summer break where its the student and only the student even tho sometimes he or she may have help from family members that still doesnt assure they will still get there education if their looking at something a teacher designed then letting them design it themselves. Its the students summer theey should atleast be able to design it themselves and not the teachers.

In conclusion students that go to schools where they have projects over                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ",4,Summer projects,Independent
D3E723651DF3,"While on summer break, students typically do not enjoy being assigned school work. There is an ongoing debate over whether or not students should be able to design summer projects. Those who oppose this state that teachers should design student's projects, but this is not true. Although some may disagree students should be allowed to design summer break projects.

There are a variety of reasons why students should design summer break projects. If students where allowed to design projects, one would be able to find an enjoyable topic to focus on. For example, instead of a book review, one could write about a destination they are visiting over the summer. This allows students to enjoy their summer break while still completing school assignments. The summer time is a time for rest; however, students still need to complete assigned projects. If students could design their own projects, one would feel more free and content; as a result, Leaving them with less stress and anxiety. Many students summers are very busy. In between summer camps and plane rides students may find it hard to locate time to complete such work. By designing there own projects, these students can work around their schedule to make the most efficient plan.

There are even more reasons why students should be allowed to design summer projects. During summer students do not want to focus on school. If one is allowed to personalize their own assignment, they will be able to focus more on the task at hand; as a result, the product will come out much better. By using relevant topics that the student is interested in, one can find more information on it than a premade prompt by teachers. Even though school work is typically not fun, students can find a way to make education more exciting. Preforming experiments is a great way for students to have fun while working. A simple test on how baking soda and vinegar react with each other can make a boring day into an explosive one! Without interest in a topic one might find it hard to complete an assignment on it. This is why students should be allowed to use topics they are interested in.

Although some may disagree students should be allowed to design summer break projects.

By allowing students to design projects teachers will find: The projects will come out better, students will be able to enjoy doing them, and their student will be less stress while completing. Some believe that it is more important for teachers to assign projects to students but this is not true. By allowing students to create their own work, teachers will find that the overal l quality of work, and happiness of the class will be raised.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9A165155AC0C,"Summer Projects for school should be Teacher-designed because it will show students the expectations for the course, helps them learn the specific material that is needed, and keeps students on track. The main part of summer projects is to assure that students continue their learning process. While schools have long breaks at a time, it is difficult to come back and still remember all of the things that was taught before being let out for a long amount of time. Teachers and student both struggle to jump back into the schedule of going to school each day. Many students have a hard time maintaining everything after being a way and not looking at the material for a while. Some schools require students to complete assignments or projects during a long period break to maintain their learning abilities, but if students are not given the right objective, then they are bound to not learn anything. There are many examples on why summer projects should be teacher-designed.

First, students need expectations and requirements for school projects because it shows them what the teacher will be looking for while grading. This can relate back to whenever a teacher is gone for a period of time or is absent for the day and tells the students what is expected of them while the teacher is away. Having expectations and requirements for a project makes sure that the student puts in effort and that the assignment is detailed with the right topics. While students are working on an assignment, and essay, or a project, they do tend to lead their way off topic and start to write about unnecessary details. Having a list or a checklist of things that are expected of each student helps them know what needs to be on it and it is easier to follow.

Most students have said that they prefer checklist and requirements than anything else because it is helpful to check off instructions and make sure that everything that is needed is on the assignment.

Next, having students keep the learning process going during the summer with help their growing minds, but if they are not given the right topics and material then they will be confused and would have not learned a single new thing. With projects, students are suppose to make the assignment talk and discuss a main point of a topic. Teachers usually make projects as specific as possible, if the student was told to do it themselves then it would be easy for them to not go into detail and specifics about anything. In school, most topics have a huge variety of smaller details and information that would not be a main point in assignments and projects. Students would have to follow what the teacher wants to make sure that they do not write down the wrong information. Most of the time, when a teacher designs a project, they usually give a variety of tools and websites to go to if they need more information on something. Those websites and tools will give the specific examples and info on what the topic is based on and it will help the students have a better knowledge of the main point.

Lastly, after focusing on one main topic for a long time, students tend to get bored and not try as hard as they should. Some students have a hard time staying on track while doing something school related on their own, they usually need some guidance to follow and go by. If summer projects were student-designed, the students would not be able to follow what they need to do and would not have any rules to go by. Different students have different ways of learning, some like to do hands on activities or web quests to learn, others just prefer to write down everything that they learn as notes. A teacher-designed project can give different ways of portraying the material. A teacher-designed project will also make students be on time with the assignment. If a teacher assigns a summer project, they will most likely attach when specific things are due at what time, for example: the essay portion will be due in 2 weeks, the rough draft is due in 1 week, the poster with the end result is due the first day of school. Most big projects that take a while to finish will have smaller tasks to finish throughout of period before it is due. Teachers can tell if students are on the right track if they assign things during the process of working on the project.

In other words, having a student designed summer project is not a great idea. If students made the project by themselves, the teacher could become confused while trying to figure out the main topic. Students would not follow any sort of guideline unless a teacher attaches it to the assignment. If the project was not designed by a teacher, then the student making it would not be great with knowing when to put deadlines and they would not be sure with what to put on the project. The summer project will most likely be done much sooner because made it clear when things will be due. If it was made by a student, they will more likely slack off and be lazy with portraying the assignment. A teacher-designed summer project would be the most efficient way to stay on track with deadlines, to know what to talk about or not, and it shows the requirements and expectations that the teacher wants to see.         ",6,Summer projects,Independent
3F04C12160E5,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. This helps them to keep their brain running. I believe that the students should get to design what project they want to do. Choosing their project will guarantee that they are focused while working on it, they will choose a topic that interests them, and their grade will result at a higher score.

Allowing students to choose their projects will help keep them focused on it. For example, if a student likes things related to writing, they will enjoy working on it. They will give it all their effort and time. It also allows them to focus more on the topic itself. Being home will let also let them be comfortable working on their projects. They will not be distracted by any classmates. They will feel less pressured by their teachers to get things done. They will be able to pace themselves. And their hard work will be reflected in their projects.

Students tend to get exited about a topic they are interested in. Giving them the freedom to do so will result in a better researched project. They will also be interested in similar things, so they will continue to research without them being told to do so. The quality of their project will be reflected by their interest in the topic they choose.

Some people may believe that getting their research project assigned by a teacher is better. I disagree with this statement. Students will feel the pressure of getting the assignment done because a teacher told them to do so. Some may even do the project last minute because they were not interested in the topic. Or maybe they were not comfortable working on it. Their efforts to work on the project will be decreased, resulting in a much lower grade. If a student chooses the topic they want to work on, and the time they dedicate to working on it, they will get a higher score. It will assure that the students continue to learn during their break.

In conclusion, a student-designed project will ensure they continue to learn over the break. They will get to enjoy their break and learn at the same time. A teacher-designed project will make them lose interest and effort. What would you prefer? ",4,Summer projects,Independent
4183BA00BE40,"Summer projects are dreaded by most students, despite the beneficial continuity in learning they provide during the otherwise schoolwork-free summer break. Such projects are only rewarding if they include information relevant to the corresponding course they were assigned for, making the idea of ""busy work"" both unecessary and hated by students (as is often the case in more open ended student-designed assignments). Teacher-designed summer assignments are far more effective than student-designed alternatives, as teachers can integrate necessary and prerequisite information for the course, the assignments are less open to interpretation and more focused, and students recieve an assignment that is both more impactful and less work-intensive.

Teachers are well versed in their respective subjects, and have a good understanding of what information is necessary in order to succeed in a specific course. They are able to structure summer assignments in correspondence with key information, helping students start a course off strong. My AP Biology teacher illustrated such a well-directed summer assignment last year. She included information that was necessary for the transition into an AP science course, leading to the majority of the class being well-versed in key concepts by the beginning of the school year. This was reflected by the class average of an A in the first quarter. The alternative of a less directed student-designed project would lack the benefit of being structured by an individual knowledgable in key topics and would likely prove detrimental to both grades and overall understanding.

More often than not, student-designed projects entail open exploration of a plethora of topics. While this can sometimes be beneficial, such open interpretation leads to less directed focus on the actual cirriculum, making the student-designed approach less effective than the teacher-designed counterpart. My computer science teacher assigned such a flawed project during this past summer, requiring students to merely explore and document anything computer related and create a project based on the findings. While such a project took student interest into account, it had little to no focus on the actual coding and programming cirriculum of the course. If my teacher had assigned us a project that required gaining a decent and basic understanding of code instead of an open ended exploration, we would have likely gained far more knowledge relevant to the course and a better idea of what the course's focus would be.

Students already loathe the idea of doing work over the summer. Requiring students to not only complete a summer assignment, but forcing them to design it as well is both aimless and unecessary. Teachers designing these assignments with intentful structure makes the completion of the such projects less rigorous and more impactful, including the actual cirriculum of a given course without forcing the students to do any extra work in designing the project. Students want to enjoy their summer and not be weighed down by a huge project. Cutting down on unecessary work would make students and teachers alike happier, as students have less to do and teachers have less to grade, making teacher-designed projects the logical choice.

Teacher-designed summer projects are more impactful than student-designed ones, as teachers have a good idea of what information is key for understanding of important concepts, they can narrow the focus of the project to aid in transition into the subsequent course, and they are less rigorous and more impactful. Students will appreciate the boost in understanding provided by a well structured teacher-designed project.",5,Summer projects,Independent
51980DE241EE,"Summer project assigments should be teacher designed and not designed by students. Most students cannot be trusted to choose a project design that would truly challenge them and help them learn the subject, and teachers are more well equipped to create a project format that is effective and user-friendly.

If summer projects were student designed, the project would be ineffective and students wouldn't learn as much from them as they would if teachers had assigned them. Students cannot be trusted to create something that would be challenging, and therefore a valuable learning eperience. Students would want to create a project that is easy to do and would result in the best grade for themselves, and cannot objectively prioritize their learning experience. If this was how projects were conducted, there would be no point in doing summer projects in the first place because nobody would learn from them. There would also be inconsistencies in the projects that everyone does, if they can create them indiiviually, students would have different assignments from each other and the grading would be biased. If the students had to come to the conclusion of one project designed together, they wouldn't be able to agree on one thing and each indiviual would want different things to be included in the project. In contrast, if things are designed by teachers, everyone gets the same project and it is not made with a bias towards what works better for one student compared to another. Teachers can be objective in their creation of a project so that it challenges everyone in some way. For example, my history teacher often designs projects in very different ways. For one unit, he will have an individual project that focuses on a complex and creative formatting to communciate the information learned in the unit. For the next unit, he will have a group project where people have assigned roles and have to execute specific actions and work together. These projects work well in a way that can only be thought out and executed by a teacher because they challenge students in the actual material of the subject, but also challenge them in their skills of formatting, public speaking, teamwork, and communications, which are valuable skills to learn in their own right. These are extra factors in a project that you woudn't get without the involvement of a teacher.

Teachers are also better at creating projects because they have more experience and knowledge with the concept. It is most likely that students have never had to create a project themselves before, so they wouldn't know where to start, what to include, how it should be graded, etc. Teachers have made many projects as apart of their jobs, and they know the design that tends to be more approachable for students, the material that seems to be the right level of difficulty, and how to grade it so that it is a proper evaluation of the student's abilities. Teachers are also well versed in the subject that they teach and would know the material that is most relevant and important to properly assess a student's understanding on. A student would have no guidance on what parts of the subject they learn is considered to be of highest value, and many projects are based on some of the most difficult concepts in the unit, so that a student is forced to spend more time with the ideas to gain a better understanding. Teachers are the ones who create the tests and quizzes that a student has to take on the material, and with this knowledge they know what students tend to struggle with and what parts of the unit should be focused on for an ideal learning experience.

One could argue that students should create their own projects because they would get better grades on them and it would be easier for them to understand, but this concept has too many factors of bias invovled and a student wouldn't be able to get a comepletely objective learning experience. If we only learned the things we wanted to learn, we would miss out on a lot of valuable skills in life and leanring experiences that help us with other subjects. If a student likes english, they can study literature and progress in that field, but they can only go so far if they only learn english without any teachings in history, math, or science. In the example of only learning literaure, there are many exmaple of historical references, scientific vocabularly, and mathematics in complex literature, and one cannot fully understand these works without a precursory knowledge in the other fields. Thus, projects cannot be student run just towards things they enjoy. Although it would be more enjoyable for the stundet to work on, it wouldn't be as effective educationally and there would be missing parts to the whole concept that need go be addressed.

There's a reason teachers are teachers and students are students. Students need to use their educational experience to focus purely on learning the subject at hand and useful skills for their lives. Teachers are there to help guide us to these goals, and this path is led astray when students start to do the jobs of teachers, and the effective system begins to fall apart. Educational experts are trained to know what they're doing, and it is our job to trust them and learn as much as we can. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
B1703E8A7555,"Summer is my favorite time of year. In the United States, schools have a little over two months break from school each year. During this period of time schools usually give students assignments to help them remember all that they have learned during the school year. It is very common for teachers and other staff to design these assignments for schools, including my own school. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because it would make it a more engaging and exciting experience for students, and it would help students be more productive over the summer.

Student-designed projects would make summer projects more engaging for students, while still expanding their knowledge. An experience I had with this was after I finished my freshman year in high school. Over the summer I had a ten page assignment for my math class that I had to finish before the first day of school started. This experience was very frustrating because all I could think about at that time was what I was missing out on with all my other summer activities. This assignment was very long and boring for me to do, when it could've been a lot more fun and exciting if students could've brought their own personal intrests and ideas into it. Another example was when my friend Generic_Name had to do an assignment for German class. The teacher asked each of the students to research one aspect of German culture and then make a power point with pictures with what they found. Although this wasn't a summer assignment it shows how assignments can be made more engaging if students can take charge in it. In this instance, Generic_Name was able to research a specific part of German culture she was interested in, and she actually enjoyed taking part in this project. Summer projects have the potential to be very engaging and could even bring in personal interest if they could be student lead.

If students were able to design their own summer assignments it would help them be more productive with their free time. In past years at my school, teachers have assigned specific assignments for the summer, but this last year they had a checklist of some educational activities one could take part in such as: watch a documentary, read a book of choice, go to a museum, and so on. I decided to go to a science museum with my family, where we learned about astronomy, oceanography, meteorology, and much more. This experience was very fun because I got to spend time with my family, but also it helped me learn even more about science, which I already love. It also helped me go outside the house and be productive with my time instead of sitting around and watching TV all day. Another time, some friends of mine told me that they don't even do the assignments until the last few days before school starts. These summer projects are not even helping the students learn if they're just rushing to finish. In this instance, the students were not even being productive with they're time because when they rushed to complete the assignment they could not comprehend what they're writing down. Summer is a time when people don't have too much going on, so it promotes laziness and procrastination, but with an interesting assignment it could bring students off the couch.

Some may disagree and say that teachers should design these summer assignments. Although it is understandable to think this way, this reasoning is flawed because teacher-designed projects don't always connect with the students. One example I have of this was with our summer reading book from last summer, 'Craig and Fred.' This novel was about a marine in Iran who found a dog and brought him back home even though it was against the military rules. I thought the book was very well written, and I appreciated this experience Craig shared with us, but I personally didn't connect with the story because I couldn't relate to the characters in the book and it wasn't a kind of book I usually read. When teachers give these kind of assignments it's hard to relate and have a good experience doing them. Bad feelings toward summer projects could be entirely avoided if students were able to choose their own book or even put in suggestions for them. I've had so many experiences in high school where I just didn't connect with or completely understand an assignment, and has resulted in it being very hard to complete. Some teachers can come up with fun activities for projects, but it would help students overall if they could have input in their projects.

It is important to remember that school is not made to stress students out with all the tests and assignments teachers give them, it is to help students learn all about the world and prepare us for real life. In the past teachers have planned out these projects for the summer, but I believe in the future that should change because it can help students see how things they've learned in school work in the outside world. So teachers, let students take charge for once!",6,Summer projects,Independent
20D092AFC4C5,"Have you ever imagined allowing students design their own summer projects? Would allowing them be beneficial to their learning? Many strongly believe that if students were to design their own assignments it would give them more motivation, but if anything it is not educationally helping them. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students would not actually do their assignments, the teachers know exactly what they want their students to learn during the summer, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the upcoming school year.

Many students always have a way of getting their teachers to allow them come up with class assignments but that is not always the best thing to do. If it is up to them to create what they need for the summer, they will not be productive. They can create something that they think is so much fun compared to the things their teacher gives them, but it could be something completely different to the subject their work should be about. All teachers know what every single one of their students need to improve on; they create assignments based on certain subjects an individual or the whole class needs help on, so that it does not become a huge issue when entering the following school year. I mean don't get me wrong, teachers understand that the work they hand out to their students can't always be boring and when it is time to create the students assignments they should include some interesting activities for them to accomplish. Perhaps allowing them to create summer work is in some ways practically, but it is a distraction in the sense of it could take them all summer to settle down on a project they want and if that was the case then they would have wasted their whole summer of learning in just thinking about a project they want rather than simply just getting their work from their teachers. Certain people do have their own opinions, but what we always need to do is put our students education first.

This should be viewed as a great opportunity teachers have for preparing their students for the upcoming school year. A strong number of people whether it's parents, teachers from different schools, or just friends don't believe that giving their kids summer work does prepare them for the next school year. In my past summers I remember that there wasn't a time where i did not have some sort of assignments to work on and I remember I always understood the first few subjects we were learned and that was because all the assignments I worked on actually helped me when school started. Many of my friends always tell me how one simple assignment did so much for them. I would always be lost and understand the new material from the very beginning. One simple project, work book, or even a packet of a certain subject can take a student so far, allowing students to feel more at ease and also allowing them to get amazing grades from the first few weeks of school. More so, it is a beneficial way to have more students succeed when testing time roles around at the end of the year. There has been a great amount of students who do strongly agree with summer projects being teacher-designed simply because they realize how remarkable the finishing results are.

When thinking of a subject like this a number of questions run through my head like, "" Would the students or I truly create something so efficient to our learning just by instructions given to us from our teachers that try to explain what we need? "". Going back to the issue on students completely misinterpreting their expectations; not all kids can come up with an assignment that covers the details they need to work on. From personal experiences there has been multiple times where my teacher allowed us to make our own projects that should cover all our subject units, but I completely failed because i would think I was doing it all correct and when it came to the due date and test time I would fail. This is just an inefficient way, especially if you want your students to actually do great in your class. I mean it also makes it so much harder for the students to recover and catch up or having to bring up their grades. In the end it's all about assuring your students will be outstanding throughout the whole school year in everything they do.

Student-designed summer projects might have a nice sound to it, but a students future should be in consideration. All these summer assignments should be teacher-designed simply because students will not complete their tasks, all teachers know the work their students need to improve on, and it's an efficient way for teachers to prepare their students for the following school year, so that it does not hit them all at once. Students could go through a great amount of stress if it were up to them and that could all end in a horrendous way, which is why it is not a great idea to allow them to create their summer work.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent
9C480C68AA9B,"If the Summer is plagued with more work we should be the ones to design it, so we can still be an creative and a hardworking student, have a strong understanding of the subject and voice out pressing matters in the world.

While us students want to be done with school and be free, it is scientifically proven that if you don't continue learning a subject you'll forget about the subject you're learning. To keep that retention, the students should create a project to keep you the students in check; It can vary from a research project to an presentation using key objectives in class to show how you used them in the real world. The position everyone should say is, yes to further have higher Graduation rates and Test scores, because if the students show compassion to their school work & their will to get things done, every one will succeed. When we work together, build each other up and help each other when needed the world becomes a whole lot brighter, nobody should have to be bogged down in a project that seems like it was made to have you suffer. This project should be fun and should make you want to complete it to show your classmates how well you did; It should also prove that you care for your work and backs it up .

On the flip side teachers did go to college for, four plus years and have been in this profession for even longer, so that is a great factor onto why most summer projects are teacher designed and so pressing on certain subjects. It's not supposed to be hard, the teachers just want he best for you, and have to teach you the schematics for next year or for life. It's similar to parenting, sometimes you have to be harsh to get the point through and the point is to get that student to be well rounded before he/she leaves high school. All the Teachers want to see is the students being successful and confident in everything they do to better on their lives. In short they want us to succeed to better on our lives; which is selfless and much appreciated.

Another way to choose a student project would be an voting system, a select few would pitch in ideas that are teacher approved, that way we are still learning the curriculum but in a different/ active way; After that the whole class votes, yes or no. If yes it goes on to other classrooms until the verdict is reached on if the project is fundamentally helpful and play a healthy part on work ethic. This project will help students with the strengths and weaknesses, they can either group up to get it done quickly or go solo a on their own pace. Instead of laying on the couch, eating, sleeping, overall being lazy they can make that brain work as if they were still in school, I'm talking about firing all 8 cylinders and constantly learn more on a rigorous daily basis

However, teachers are no joke though as they work day and night to give us students the best education possible, it's stressful being a teacher and in our eyes a worthy sacrifice.

Grading papers form 150 students and also having to stay on track and give out more papers is a hassle; thats why we have teacher aide's to help them get through the day which is selfless and deserves recognition. To every teacher, thank you for doing what you do if we did not have you we would not be here learning.

To add on to the previous statements, we can be more inclusive and have a battle of the brains where all teachers do a project & students do a project, whoever wins by vote from the school staff will get a a reward of their teams choice; these are all just ways to do school work but with a spin of fun & healthy competition, because seriously work can be boring for teachers and students alike ways we can fix this on a daily basis are:

Have an reward system regarding questions and candy.

Play an Kahoot game on the subject to engage participation.

Let students design homework or class plans.

Let them grade papers and see the process and life of a teacher.

Have students stand up and stretch.

Ice breaker activities.

Talk about foreign matters.

These are just a few ways to stick out from the typical, book work and paper.

Book work has dated back decades, Its time to modernize and find different ways to learn.

While for decades teachers have been prescribing projects that are an inch thick in paper, we have been struggling, we need change now; Change is good and needed change is how we industrialized and now change will be how we do our tests, papers, essays & projects. We should be able to choose what subject a paper is on and how should it be done, because in all honesty we are the future so we need to work on certain matters, problems & accessions towards our future like emissions, pollution & much much more. Student designed projects will talk about these matters and open up the public eyes about how serious we, the youth of tomorrow are taking it as serious as Gun control, College Debt and other pressing matters. Allowing us students to work and talk about problems all around us would be a pleasure to spread awareness on these subjects.

To wrap this all up, We the students of tomorrow would love to be able to control summer projects in terms of spreading awareness/ looking at hard topics the public usually avoids. To be inclusive and attention grabbing is the goal and we can push for regulations throughout the school system, a recent matter was opening high school later than usual and getting in the nitty-gritty with financial costs & Bus scheduling. We can and will build each other up on these group projects. In turn we are equipping the mind for the real world we can use steps the we gained form high school and teamwork to get the job done, test scores & graduation rates would be higher due to us engaging in school year round. To close, we can't get anything done without Teamwork and student input, we need to let students have a say in their education to let them be the best the they can be in anything and everything they do.             ",4,Summer projects,Independent

In some schools summer projects are assigned to students for various academic or elective based classes, these projects should be soley designed by the students and not by the teacher. Teacher-designed projects can lead to an interference with a students out of school life, be restrictive, and result in a higher lack of motivation.

Summer projects have a negatively connotated aspect attached to them that has continued on for many generations and people. Most students and classmates dread to hear the words ""summer project"" mostly due to the fact that it takes time away in which they could have been using to initiate in other things to benefit their lives or even just enjoy themselves. As it is, teachers lack a general scope of what a typical student can accomplish within their summer, as everyone pertains to their own activities during that time. Having the project written and designed by a number of students, or even just by themselves,would give a better outlook on the reasonable things to be accomplished where a teacher only expresses expectations which sometimes cannot be met. It is easy to set unreasonable expectations when the person setting them themself is not attuned to do it. Having the project designed by students could lead to much more accomplishment than expected as well. It is easy to assume students would try to make the project easier on themselves but just because the project is student designed doesn't mean it couldn't be regulated or have certain requirements given to them by others.

Each student is unique with different qualities and strengths. By making a teacher design the project it ultimatley takes away from a students expression and creativity because of the specific standards given to them. Expression is an important quality when it comes to projects. Not only does it make a student think more, but it also enhances their learning because they can express their ideas in different forms. It gives them more room to come up with their own ideas. A student-designed summer project would give the students a vast possibility to individually express themselves. When a teacher becomes the sole leader of making a project each project turned in by the class is the same but with different aspects, like color for example, and don't require the student to be creative. This in turn could eventually dull their levels of creativity and expression that could have benefitted them highly in their lives later on. Overall, a student-designed project could positively enhance the students and their educations more than that of which a teacher designed in all entirety. Projects are given to a student over the summer to retain knowledge and learn, if a teacher then leaves them no room to grow then the whole project defeats its own purpose altogether.

Many students lack motivation. Whether it involves school or simple activities outside of school, most students find themselves procrastinating or not doing what they set out to do at all. This is made evident by the amount of students who do not do their homework or even classwork and is a stunningly large amount no matter the school spectated and monitored. Students already deal with piles of homework or even other work given to them outside of school by their family, friends, or even job. Giving another assignment to a student, over the summer at that, will likely not be completed. By letting a student design their own summer project, not only does it increase the productivity of the project, but it aslo motivates them to complete it, or at the very least put some work into it. When a student designs a project, they base it mainly on what they would find interesting to work on rather than when a teacher assigns them something they tend to have no interest in at all. In comparison, if a person were to get a job and dread going to work everyday, it is likely that they would eventually quit; whereas, if a person finds their job interesting or enjoyable they are more likely to continue and pursue that job. The same could be said for a summer project. Teachers focus specificly on getting academic topics as the main focus rather than if it would actually be entertaining or fun for a student to do and take part in. I believe this says a lot about why students should be the ones to design it for themselves.

Altogether, the preference between teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects weighs heavily towards the students. Giving a student the opportunity to enjoy their break from school, letting them express themselves, and giving them something they actually find interesting is an important part of summer projects most do not consider. Students are more than capable of completing their own projects and retaining their knowledge by something they themselves designed rather than an authoritative figure.",6,Summer projects,Independent
095F6D0A8377,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects in order for students to continue learning during their break; these projects, however, should be designed by students. Instead of sitting in a boring room and having no say in planning a project, students should plan them themselves. Allowing students to design their own summer projects makes projects more interesting and enjoyable.

Allowing students to plan their own projects gives the students more freedom to use their creativity. When students plan their own projects, students have the opportunity to decide what they want their projects to be. For example, some students may want to their project to be a science fair. If they had the freedom to plan out their science fair, they would be in control; which would allow them be able to plan about what each person could present at the science fair or even when the science fair will take place. In turn, it could allow students to be creative and enjoy themselves. Allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to decide for themselves.

While allowing students to design their own projects give students the freedom to express their creativity, it also shows that they are responsible. When they design their own projects, they show that they are able to make responsible decisions. For example, the students that wanted their project to be a science fair might have to consider where the science fair will take place and what type of concessions will be there. These are the decisions that the students will think about when they plan there science fair, and will result in proving their critical thinking skills and responsible decision-making. When students have the ability to plan out their own projects, they can be responsible enough to make good and smart decisions.

However, there are those who disagree and state that students should not plan their own projects because there would be too much responsibility for the students to handle; there would also be too much freedom and students can take a negative advantage or abuse that freedom. On the contrary, the students would not have too much responsibility due to there being a large body of students pitching in ideas. As a result, there would not be too much responsibility on only one student or a small section of students. Another reason why these statements are false is because with a large amount of freedom, student can be a lot more creative when designing projects.

In conclusion, students who participate in summer projects, that is required by school, should be able to plan these projects themselves. Eventhough some may disagree, their statements are false. If more summer projects were designed by students instead of teachers, more students would enjoy and appreciate summer projects a lot more. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
658D9641A1C6,"The end of summer is coming and you're required to complete a project, before going back to school. Some claim that a teacher designed project is more sensible rather than a student designed project,I think a student designed project is better because the teachers provide boring topics,students get the freedom to choose whatever, and let's the students show there creativity.

A student designed project, would be better because teachers provide students with boring topics;If the topics the teachers gave us wasn't boring than students would show more excitement towards the subject as a whole. Such as students don't want to be forced to do a project on something they don't really care about,teachers give out boring topics and expect high tier work from students. Teacher designed project would only be sensible if and only if the student had no idea what to do there project on.

Giving the students an option to design there own projects opens the door for them to show off there creativity. Students rarely get to show there creativity in anything,but if the project was a student based design then the project would be completed at a higher standard compared to a teacher based design. Student based designs would go more in depth with the project giving the audience a true visual on what the student is trying to show compared to a followed rubric that a teacher gave to you.

Last but not least,a student based project shows the teachers your'e capable of using self thinking skills. Showing your'e teacher you know how to use certain skills,such as giving them information on things you need to improve on and things your already good at.

some have claimed that teachers know whats best for the students,but I thought otherwise as the boring topics they give us,not letting us show our creativity and last but not least our self thinking skills.                                                  ",3,Summer projects,Independent
9C97C5A04635,"After nine months of endless assignments and fighting the desperate battle to balance academics and extracurriculars, summer break arrives for public schools around the country. Those three months spent relaxing in the sun can be a much needed escape for many, but they can also do a huge disservice, as the knowledge that was previously gathered slowly deteroriates with the sudden loss of daily learning. Schools across America have begun to hand out summer assignments for the classes that are to be taken that fall, and it has ultimately been a success. The question now is how these summer assignments should be created and then presented. I personally believe that these projects and worksheets should be student-designed and for the following reasons: students understand their own time restraints, they know what level of difficulty works for them, and they can see what is and isn't necessary to review.

First is the management of time. The only people who understand what kinds of schedules students follow over the summer are students themselves. Many teachers seem to believe that the summer experienced by high schoolers is similar to those in Disney Channel movies; they wake up at noon and hang out with their friends every day until school starts back up again. The tough truth to accept is that summer has only gotten harder with the passing years. Many students pick up part time jobs to gain income, while others take on their own academic hurdles, such as Generic_School. It can be extraordinarily difficult to find time to lift your head above the flowing current of busywork, which makes it more important that students design these summer assignments. They know how much time to set aside for academic work, and they can think through an effective time management plan which would make assignments not too short and also not too long: moderation.

The second point to examine is the level of difficulty. Students know what kind of work they can handle. From personal experience, it wasn't very fun to sit at the beach and attempt to complete the first page in a packet of AP Chemistry problems, but it was perfectly necessary and extremely helpful. The questions required knowledge from past teachings and a small amount of inference and research, and I completed the assignment in just a few hours. I had to read out of a textbook to understand new concepts, but the work itself was fairly simple. It's these kinds of summer assignments that students would be able to effectively compose, because they do in fact want a healthy challenge, just not an impossible feat. The difficulty levels should vaguely coincide with whatever class the work is preparing students for, without giving them the feeling that they are already back in school.

The last point is knowing what's necessary and what isn't. For example, a long assignment for an optional music class seems rather unnecessary compared to simply suggesting practice over the summer. If students were required to have a lengthy project for every single class that they planned on taking the upcoming school year, summer wouldn't exactly be much different than every other month. Students don't need a complete break, but they also don't need three more months consisting of the same grueling and tasking work. I do think that AP classes should be handing out summer assignments. But academic courses? That's for the teachers to decide.

In conclusion, students are smart enough to form their own summer assignments that follow the basic guidelines given by teachers. They know how to wisely create a project that doesn't absorb too much or too little time, isn't too easy or too hard, and is completely necessary for staying on track in school. Not every student would be willing to work on an idea for a project that would be assigned to each of their classmates, but every grade has several bright and accomplished achievers who would take up the challenge. Students know their own limits. We can set them for ourselves.",5,Summer projects,Independent
C068F7168129,"Every year when summer break rolls around, students become restless and excited. But as soon as they get comfortable and begin to relax and enjoy the stress-free summer life, the realization that they have school projects to do hits them like a ton of bricks, oftentimes draining the enjoyment from their time on break. Many school teachers find it easiest and most convenient to design a project and assign it to the students, but this just ends up turning into a chore for students. What if, to lessen the students' feelings of resentment towards summer projects, the teachers allowed the projects to be student-designed? Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, in reality it is much more beneficial to the student for the projects to be student-designed.

Required summer projects should be student-designed because when students are in control of their project, they are able to express themselves and an interest they may have through the assignment. Teachers, when designing the project they assign, may feel that by providing parameters and a rubric for an assignment they are helping the student out. In reality, they are just limiting the student to think in the way the teacher thinks. On the other hand, when students design the project, they are better able to express a passion they would like to share with others. For example, a project that requires the student to read a book and do a report on the character symbolism simply becomes a chore in the eyes of the student. This student may have a passion for nature and animals, yet there would be no way for them to express that passion within the confinement of a literary analysis project. If the student were able to design the project by his or herself, it would immediately become less of a chore as they would have the freedom to do the project on something they love, be it nature, music, art, athletics, science, or any other topic of their choice. It is almost guaranteed that a student will put more effort into a project regarding a topic they are interested in. When students have a say in their assignment, it no longer feels like a pointless task forced upon them by a superior; thus, the quality of the project will likely be higher as they will feel motivated when the assignment allows them to express themselves.

When students design their own projects, they develop independence that shapes them as an individual and prepares them for later in life. By telling their students exactly what to do for a summer project, teachers may be making it easier for the student in the short term. In the long term however, they are restricting the student's independence and individuality by not allowing them to make their own mature choices in designing their own project. When a student is allowed to design their own project, they are making small choices that teach them how to think and make choices independently and creatively without constant oversight. As well as training the student to make their own decisions, designing a project teaches individuals to have confidence. This is a much needed trait for teenagers nowadays who often times lack the self-confidence needed to pursue something they have a passion for. It is beneficial to society to instill self-confidence, individuality, and independence in students so that they are able to pursue their passions in life. These traits that can arise from something as simple as designing one's own project prepare individuals for life in the real world to be productive citizens that can make a difference in the world.

Something as simple as a required summer project can have lasting effects on students if they are allowed to design it themselves and are not confined by the boundaries instilled by their teacher. When a student is able to design the project them self, they are able to express passions they may otherwise have no way to express and will likely create a higher quality project because of their interest in a topic. Also, designing the project by one-self instills confidence, independence, and individuality which are valuable traits today in teenagers transitioning to adulthood. Although some believe that required summer projects should be teacher-designed, the benefits that result from allowing the project to be student-designed can potentially shape an individual to be ready to go out into the real world and make a difference. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
5789A415F29D,"When students are on summer break they want to have fun. Some schools require students to do projects to make sure the students are still learning during the break. The summer projects should be student-designed because students can do topics they have better understanding of and students can learn more information on the topics they are doing.

Students hate having school work during summer break, but if the students decide on what topic they wanna do it can be easier and fun. The projects can be on topics students really understand and actually have interest in. For example, what if the student loves the solar system they can do a topic on that and really understand it because they find interest in it. Students that understand there topics have a better chance at showing their teachers that they really understand and they know what they are doing. The more students understand the better the project will come out.

While doing projects sometimes students need to look up information on topics they are doing. Students can learn more information on that topic. However , the teacher teaches students information about that topic, but what if they look up a topic and find more information than what the teacher told them . The students are finding out more information that can possibly help them in the long run. For example, say you picked how plants are developed, but your teacher gives you information about how plants are developed, but you find better information and its accurate.

Some students think that projects during the summer are boring, but they can actually help them understand the topics more and can become really fun . School projects during the summer time may not be fun, but can really benefit students in the end and actually help them. These projects can be very helpful and can even prepare students for the next school year. If more schools allow students to design their own projects , then the more the students will actually complete them.",3,Summer projects,Independent
A0A41E351FC9,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The question is should these projects be designed by the teacher or by the student. Normally the teacher designs the projects for the student however, it may be more beneficial if the students design the projects for themselves. There are multiple reasons why the students designing their own projects would be more beneficial, they can choose what they want to learn about, they can use their own creativity, and the teachers can learn more about what the students are interested in.

Firstly, the projects would be much more interesting if the students chose what they wanted to learn about. In other words, they would be way more intrigued and enthusiastic about a topic they like than a topic thats irrelevant to what they care about. Teachers usually give student mundane topics just to keep them occupied for the summer. But now the students can focus on something they care about and will be beneficial to them in life. For example, a teacher may want the students to do a project about the history of Germany but a student who has an interest in becoming a doctor may want to do a project that involves researching the types of doctors that work in the hospital and what they do. See how the project designed by the student is most definitely more beneficial and more oriented towards the students interests.

Furthermore, the students can use this as an opportunity to tap into their own creativity. They now have the chance to create something that represents their own individual interests. The students can actually put their minds into their work and create something new and exciting, which would make them even more eager to learn. The students could work in groups and put their diverse creativity together.

Since the students will most likely design a project about something their interested in the teacher can has the opportunity to also learn something new. Like what their students like to do and would like to be when they grow up. The teacher could also try to measure the creativity of the students and implement a creative curriculum that matches the creativity of the students. Thus, increasing the students will to learn more.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9E1F768837D9,"Have you ever had an project over the summer, and you thought what If this was student designed ? Well I defer, I truly believe that if summer projects were ran by students it will be a major mishap. There are many reasons why summer projects should not be students designed. First, because many students are not going to forget about the academic part of the project. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over their summer break. For example over the summer I had to read the maximum of six books over the summer, but I could never finish or complete my goal because I would most likely forget about reading over the summer, and I would forget what strategies to use to help me complete my goal. Finally, this why I'm siding with all projects should be teacher designed.

To begin, many students believe that summer break is not to really focus on the time frame that they have to learn or set their minds on nothing pertaining to school work or anything work academic. This is an reason why projects should not be designed by students, and I feel that teachers are going to give students strategies that pertain to what the students have learned during school hours. Also I know that teachers will give students an time frame that will allow students to complete projects, and help students focus on learning during break. I learned that many reasons why I could not complete my math goal during the summer. This was because I was not setting an time frame for myself to keep track and making sure I can reach my goal, also I would very so often forget my strategies that i used during school hours to help guide me. Next, this is why projects should be designed by teachers. I know that teachers would give us many things that will help us remember, and focus such as: notes work assignments that we have done during school hours, and also an time frame of when It can be completed.

Next, teachers providing projects I felt It would be more easier on students because students need an extra boost over the summer mainly most students would feel that they might not remember, or cant retain the information and can not complete. If teachers where to design projects for students,I know that teachers will have an due date on when and how to turn in your projects on time. This suggestion is really good for students, because If students made projects that they wouldn't know how to turn in projects, or when to finish them. My teacher makes sure her students are completing and finishing projects on this website called Schoolagly. This process is to make sure that any projects or work assignments are turned in and done correctly, And also with this process teachers can add notes and definitions that will help with projects and work assignments. To become more perplex on this topic this is the reason why students should not design summer projects,and because sometimes student wouldn't know when to complete or finish these projects.

Finally, there are many reasons to why summer projects should be made by teachers and not students. These reasons are based on the needs for students, and how some students need an teachers to help them concentrate on projects during the summer. Also so students need help from teachers to manage time frame on when to complete projects. Then students might need help from teachers on how to retain the information learned during school hours. But if it were up to most students they would look at it in a different perspective a lot of time students would want to design projects, because they believe that they have all of their materials that they will need for projects and sometimes they don't which makes it hard. Also this makes it complicated for students to make and time frame on when to finish the project,also some may need assistance with remembering what strategies they used to remember during school hours. To sum It up, I truly believe this is why teachers should make all summer projects to give students an helpful path to continue learning.

In conclusion, there are many reason why students should not design break projects. Many students are going to forget about the academic part of the projects. Also many students will not set an time frame on when and how to complete these projects. Then students would not know what strategies to remember or to use to study over the break. This concept is really important,and also helps make sure students using the break time for projects,and has an adult that has put material down to help along the way. Teachers creating projects will also help by not letting the students to get off course during break. Just think about it would you want your students, or child to have projects over the break and not have to proper structure for thier projects?",4,Summer projects,Independent
0821EB1AEDED,"Students often moan and groan about summer projects that their teachers assign them to do over summer break to assure they continue learning over the period they are not in school. The projects most of the time, have a set rule book to follow that was issued by the teacher and it makes the project boring and not enjoyable for the students to do, basically being a burden the students have to over come during their relaxing summer break. These projects that get assign should be more student-designed because students can be more freely creative with their own ideas, it will be more enjoyable to do for them, and they can continue learning in a more ideal way.

Having the project be more student-designed, students would not have to struggle with limitations and can be more creative and use their own ideas for a better outcome of the project. Teachers often put a strict instructional guide or manual on what to do and what not to do, during the assignment and limits what students can do and blocks any originality. However, having a student-designed project will unleash a wave of ideas and flow of creativity between each student that would not normally be received from a common project. The whole outcome of the entire project will be changed drastically because of the freedom students will have on their own projects and in which, in the end, will satisfy them. During research projects, teachers also frequently limit the student on what they can look up and use. If the project was student-designed, students can freely look up and use what interest them and learn about something that will make them more engaged into the project. They can not be held by idea blocking rules that will make the project disengaging, they can have creativity run free throughout the entire assignment and it will show. Overall, a student-designed project will make a more standout project due to the original ideas students will leave throughout the project.

The sound of a project over the summer break already sounds boring and a headache of a time for any person in school to do but students will always be more engaged in a project that will allow their own unique spin on it and uses a piece of mind from them. The thought of a project is always a dreadful one that all, will have a hard time to get them self to do it but a student-designed project will make it at least, a more enjoyable experience. Students can utilize their brain and knowledge to make it a project to remember and have fun while thinking of an idea to blow teachers and fellow classmates away once they return from break. For example, a science fair allows students to show a unique idea with experiments, this causes fun competition and a enjoyable process on how the project is going to ""wow' the judges. Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled. The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot. This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates. In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break.

Projects also have a based way of learning, a way teachers think it's best for our generation to learn, but they are not our generation, they do not know what is best for us, they just think it; by allowing students to freely design their project, they can learn in their own ideal way. When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path.

Projects being put out during summer break will always be a boring and overbearing thing to complete and in some cases even ruin summer break for them overall just to learn information that teachers assign. Having the project be student-designed, however, will change the entire assignment in all, giving more creativity, better pacing, more enjoyment, and a better learning experience for students all around, it will benefit them rather than a teacher-designed project. All projects, even ones put out over summer break, should be student-designed because the outcome will have more uniqueness with student's ideas, the project overall will be more fun, and students will learn in their own learning way.        ",6,Summer projects,Independent
E37D480CD473,"Summer assignments are required by a multitude of schools accross the state of Virginia. But some school districts are considering breaking from the traditional teacher-designed summer projects and instead replacing them with projects designed by the students. This may reflect student desires, however, it does not reflect what is best for the students education. Summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students because it would be in the students own best interest.

Summer projects are intended to be used as preparation for courses students are going to take in the upcoming school year. Therefore, how could students be sure of what content should be emphasized; what ideas are the most important; and what materials, such as books and web sources, are the best? Furthermore, teachers will have a far greater knowledge of the courses at hand. Often times theachers will have particular material they want to be covered or emphasized over the summer. For instance, many Humanities teachers have specific books that they want students to read. Even though these books may be longer and harder than many students desire, they likely cover crucial material or are written in a certain literary style that is going to be taught about.

Some may claim that in order to have effective learning, students themselves must control the different components of their eductation. While this may be true for some aspects, such as selecting the courses they wish to take, this should not be the case for summer assignments. This is because many students may take advantage of an opportunity to design their own summer projects, by making them as quick and easy as possible. While this may allow students to enjoy their summer break more, it compromises the very objective of summer assignments, that is, to enhance their education through having continuos learning instead of a complete break from school over the summer. Instead, if teachers were to design summer assginments, they would be far more rigorous, but more importantly, they would be more beneficial for students for the upcoming school year.

If student-designed projects are too easy, they end up simply becoming busy work. More difficult teacher-designed projects would challenge students, which may seem unappealing to many, however in order to grow academically, students need a stimulus to respond to. Moreover, students become stronger learners when they are forced to overcome challenges. These challenges could include: reading a book in a foreign language; reading a book that is longer than they would like and far more dense than they are used to; or having to perform operations with dificult mathematic equations, formulas, and concepts. Nevertheless these challenges will make students think heavily and help them become better educated.

I had a really hard time chosing between these two since i can see why having kids design their own homework could be a bad thing but it could also be a good thing. I had it the same way about having teachers createing the homework, is it really the best choice? i don't know. I ended up, after thinking a lot about it, to think that kids would be the best option to create their summer homework.

These kids are expected to some time over the next 6 weeks to choose boring homework over their frinds, goodweather, pooltime, and other fun activities. What do you think that would end up in? them doing a little bit everyday or them doing it all a couple days before school starts and ruin the whole point of it? I think the later, but how do you change that? if they were part of designing the homework they would be able to make it more fun for themself and their friends and therefore be more motivated to do it more often than the last couple days of their summerbreak. If you want kids to do it more often than once every two weeks they need to be self-diciplined which creating the homework can teach them. They would have to be diciplined enough to not just choose the easiest way out but the most productive way out. Having them try and create homework for their summerbreak may start a chain reaction and make them more diciplined in doing their homework for the rest of the year since they got to experience the work and effort that is put into making their homework.

Some kids need their "" aha so that is why I'm learning this subject "" experience, which is pretty important because it helps them reply a subject to the real world which help them learn future things in that subject easier. I belive that having them help design their summer projects would help with that. I know personally that I never had it that way in woodwork, art, music or fysics/chemistry and I do belive I could have been so much better at it if I have my aha experience. I had that experience with english pretty quickly and look at me now a foreign exchange student writting a english sol. Another experience they need is the "" this is actuallt pretty fun/interesting "" experince. This experience is when you find yourself fasinated or having fun with school because you like what you are learning about. I had it that way with social studies and history which is the only reason I have a 108/100 in my history class this quater. Having them design the project would mean that they have the power to make it fun which gives them the power to make the class fun so they can have good grades and interesting conventations about what they are learning. These experiences could also help them figure out what they want to do when they get older, which is pretty important.

Despite seeing all these reasons why kids should make their own homework, I can also see why they shouldn't. I could easily imagine that a kid would take the level down so they wouldn't learn anything from it since they only know what they know and not what they don't know. I don't belive that kids and teachers ever is going to come to an agreement over the amount of homework. I also could imagine that a child would take the lowest work amount possible, which in my eyes don't sound like the purpose if summer projects. Where is their brain in this? having a fun summerbreak with their friends and family or keeping up with their learning? I don't think many children think far enough to keep up with their education when it comes to summerbreak.

in conclution I have decided that a student designed project would be the best way to go around summer projects/homework. I think that students should be able to choose what their project should be about, but I don't think they should have control on amount or level. I do belive that the benefits of having them design the projects overweights the the negative consequences of it. I also think that them learning how to be responsible and desiplined enough to make the project and actually getting them done could have massive benefits for them in the future. So why should teachers design summer projects when the student created ones have so many more benefit and is more effective?",4,Summer projects,Independent
9EFA79BF42F2,"What is something that interests you or a certain subject that interests you? This is a question that schools, who require students to complete summer projects, should ask the students. It is very important to understand what interests the students who are doing these projects. When students are doing a project they are not interested in, they are not as creative with it and they do not learn as much. I know from personal experience that when I am doing a project that interests me, I do so much better and I learn so much more about the subject. It is very beneficial for both the students and the teachers. If some students do not like it or are not interested enough, they might end up not doing the project or getting a really bad grade on it. I believe student-designed projects would be the best way to go because they will learn better and more efficiently, they will get better grades, which is very important, and it will help them learn throughout their break so that they learn so much more.

The first reason that I think student-designed projects would be better, is because they will be more interested in it if they pick something that they are passionate about. The project could be about subjects in school like Math, Science, English, or anything that is related to nature because those are some beneficial things to learn about. I know, from experience, that doing a project that interests you is so much more beneficial. When I was a freshman, my English teacher explained to us that we had to write a paper about something that we are passionate and feel very strongly about. We had to finish this paper by the time our summer break was over. It really helped a lot of my fellow classmates learn so much more about the things they are so passionate about. It was so beneficial to all of us. When we got back to school after summer break, everyone got to share what they wrote about. It was very interesting to hear everyone's point of view on certain things. I really enjoyed it.

Another reason that student-designed projects would be better, is because students can be so much more creative with them. For example, if you really love flowers and you are making a big poster project, you can be so creative with it. You can go out and take beautiful pictures, you can draw and color flowers, and you can search for interesting facts about them. Their are so many interesting things to learn about in the world. Students with creative minds should be given the ability to use them in their own way; therefore, I strongly believe they should be able to design their own projects and be creative and spontaneous with them. In order to do the projects, they still need the teacher's consent, but if it is beneficial and helps them learn, the teacher should be fine with it. It is amazing to see what students can do with all their creativity. The teachers can learn so much about their students' ability when they let them get creative.

The third reason I believe student-designed projects are better, is because it can help both the teachers and the students. If teachers just give every student the same project, some students may decide they can cheat off of their friends, especially if they are not interested in the project or just do not want to do it. If you let them design it and let them do the project about something that they love or are interested in, they will not be able to cheat and will do it on their own. It can also help the students get a better grade on it. If the students are getting better grades on it, then the teachers know that they actually learned something over summer break. I think it is very important to keep learning even over break because it keeps your brain fresh and ready to roll when school comes back around.

It is very important to know and understand what interests your students. Many students are so creative but some never get to use their creativity in school, especially if what they are doing does not interest them. It is very important to let them use their artistic abilities or any other talents they have by doing student-designed projects. Student-designed projects are better for learning and could be beneficial for students in the future even after they get out of school. They can learn many skills from doing them and it will help them continue learning. I strongly encourage teachers to let their students design their summer break projects for not only their benefit, but also for the students'.                                      ",5,Summer projects,Independent
45DDB26E6EF5,"My name is Generic_Name, I have took the position that the summer projects should be student-designed. Students should be able to designed their own summer projects, because it will allow them to get as creative as they want. For an example, they can use their own pictures, color, and words.

The pictures of the students self designed projects is the most important part of the project. It descibes what the person is talking about. It also provides extra details about what the student made their project to be. Pictures can describe what the people based their projects off. The pictures set off the main idea of the student summer project.

The color of the student project is a color code. That means the students can use their own color to descibe one part of their project. Students can also use their color to make their summer projects colorful. In other words, color can be use to make students projects creative. The reason for the color is to make the project bigger and persuade the audience to look at it.

The wodrs of the student summer project is basically to state the meaning of the project. That means it describes the Pictures, and the color they used in their project. The words are supporting details for their project. The main usage for the words in the project is to support the main idea of the project. The reason for the words is to make the the audience want to read it by supporting what the project is about.

In conclusion, I will take the position that Students should be able to designed their own projects for the summer. It is easier for students to create their own projects, because their minds move faster than some teachers. some students have the ability to create fun stories for their projects. I have supported my Position with details and reasons for me choosing this position. I hope you enojoy this Essay have a great day.",2,Summer projects,Independent
F393BAAAB876,"Summer is the best time of the year for most of the students; it is the season that brings them joy and memories. But, without an organized summer plan, the students are very likely to forget what they have learned in the school year. Because of that, some education systems suggest summer projects for students to practice lessons during their break. However, these assignments that are designed by teachers seem to be unreasonable overload and can ruin the summer vacation that the students have been waiting for. Therefore, students and teachers will both be beneficial in learning and teaching if the lessons are well-designed. Although some may say that teacher-designed projects will consist of more important lessons, those that are designed by the students will surely be effective due to its interesting topics and reasonable schedule.

Students will be more motivated if the topics come from their fields of interest. With these lessons, there will be less delay for students to work. They will explore new lessons that will later be helpful in their future careers; they would be no longer summer projects but are life lessons. For instance, in Generic_School, yearly, there are Capstone topics for students to research a topic of their own interest. There are still requirements that the topics need to meet in order to assure that students will learn new facts from their research; but, the lessons' topics are designed by the students. Because of the new learning structure, more students were involved in the projects which resulted in interesting ideas. These projects let the students to express themselves through learning. Another example, summer field trips nowadays are mostly created by students, and they are being applied to new lessons more due to their effectiveness in teaching. Letting the students to design the experiences of the lessons means letting they create their own memories of the lessons which will last longer than that of traditional methods. Being able to explore their fields of interest motivates the students, rather than compels them to learn.

Beside having a break and doing school's projects, students should have time for other activities. These activities are the main part of the summer vacation. But, it would be impossible for them to distress and try these new activities if there isn't any time. Junior rising students seem to not have access to summer break due to the overload works in preparing for the SAT and some of the school summer projects. Therefore, if the summer goes on with unreasonable loads of lessons and practices that are needed to be done, there would be lack of access for them to other activities. Summer is also the time for students to explore interesting future careers through internship and jobs opportunities. Consequently, looking at the bigger picture, if a student busy with the summer works from school, he or she will be lost in choosing interesting fields in the future due to their lack of experiences. That says, it is important for students to have time to access new activities that will determine their future.

However, there are people who believe that summer projects that are made by students will not cover enough important information, thus teacher-designed projects are the perfect choice. It is true that important lessons must be covered, but that only should be done during the school year, not during the summer break. Doing so in the summer will distress students even more due to their lack of free time. If the pressure on students keep gaining, mental diseases like depression and mood changes will appear. There are many students in Generic_School and high schools around the world have gotten mental disorders which origin is from school works. Therefore, the main component of the teaching system should be the effectiveness of the lessons, not the amount lessons that are being taught. This is a major cons of the current education system and it needs to be fixed as soon as possible. And the only ones who can truly understand the problem are the students. Thus the student's opinions towards the structure of the school's system are very important.

Projects and lessons should be designed by the students to guarantee the quality of the lessons. Through interesting topics,students will be more motivated to learn and explore new lessons. They will also have time for new activities, which will eventually help them in life. And more importantly, students will be able to avoid mental diseases, depression, etc; therefore, it creates a healthy generation of young adults. Overall, summer projects that are provided by schools should be created from the opinion and interest of students.",5,Summer projects,Independent
E215400764F3,"Have you ever received the most boring Summer assignment from a teacher and waited till the last week to do it? Many would answer yes. Summer projects are designed to allow for a child to continue to grow cognitively, while away from a continuous study at school. However, many fail to consider that kids are still on Summer break, resulting in fun activities rather than working on a project due 3 months away. In order for Summer projects to succeed, they should be student-designed to ensure engagement within the project, allow them to grow in a field of interest, and give the students an opportunity to express themselves.

Keeping students engaged in a Summer project is critical to the success of the assignments. A student is more likely to spend more time on a project that they are interest in, rather than completing required tasks that they don't want to do. Enacting student-designed projects allows for them to voice what they are likely to do that will keep them engaged in a learning activity. This allows the students to feel control over their Summer, and how they may want to incorporate learning into a fun growing experience. While they may voice their thoughts, they will also have a better understanding on what exactly to do for their project ahead of time keeping them engaged in whatever they need to accomplish. Providing a platform for students to express their ideas, leads to engagement and a product that succeeds the purpose.

For many students, their engagement in an activity comes from the topic, allowing them to have freedom as to what they create, helps them further their mind. This also allows for fun because they are more engaged based on their topic choice. Many people say that they are prone to doing better on an assignment involving a topic of interest because they care more about the product. Student's who care about a topic will give you a product that means something to them, expressing their creativity and effort that they put into an assignment. Lastly, these projects are designed to cognitively grow and maintain a child's mind over break. Learning about themselves is one of the most important ways of doing that; by allowing them to design their own project and have freedom as to what they want to do, you are allowing an opportunity for them to find out what they are interested in and understand more about themselves.

Finally, Summer is defined in a kid's mind to be a time of enjoyment and relaxation after a dwelling school year. With these Summer projects they should be associated with a similar thought. Student's designing their own project will allow for a creative outlook and give them an opportunity to create a better project than a poster board. Creativity proves to be effective in allowing for more growth than ever about how you may want to present what you learned over a break. Also when allowing a student to express creativity you are creating opportunity for them to incorporate something unique into their assignment which will further their engagement and growth.

In all, Summer projects would be more effective and beneficial to student's if they were designed by student's themselves based on an increase of interest, opportunity to grow in a field of interest, and ability to incorporate a personable and creative outlook. Student's will feel empowered and confident in their assignment by self-designing an opportunity to grow themselves. Overall the result and product will be more detailed and purposeful when engaging a student in something they enjoy while allowing growth in their self as well as their minds. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
B5CA9C10711C,"As the end of the school year approaches, I began to grow with excitement. Finally, I have a break from the stressful school work. However, as I thought I would be free from the chains, I am held back once again as teachers began to assign tedious summer project. Tired and with my strong desires of a break, I waited till the last couple weeks of summer before starting on the time consuming project. Recently, an argument has risen about whether summer projects should be student deigned or teacher designed. People who believe that the projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects would increase the percentage of participation on these projects. Others, who believed that it should be teacher designed, argue back that the knowledge teachers have on the curriculum allows the projects to be truly designed for its main intention. Teachers should be designing these summer project because of their knowledge of the future curriculum and their understanding of the mindset of students.

Teachers are well equipped with the knowledge of the future curriculum, thus they have the ability to adjust their lesson plans to help assist their students for the upcoming years. Seen by many students, lessons or skills learned in the previous school year are used in the present school year. For example, math facts, such as addition and subtraction, are constantly being referred to in all math courses. Acknowledging this reality, teachers would try to shift their lesson plans around for the purpose of trying to strengthen their students ability to understand such skills. Similar theory is applied to the designing of summer projects. Teachers, with the knowledge of what is expected in the next couple courses of a students life, would be able to shape projects into helping the students prepare for the upcoming school year.

Teachers' understanding of the mindset of typical students causes the summer projects to be unbiased. People who believed that the summer projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects will encourage for more participation, due to the fact that these projects will have a more simple design and be more easier to understand. However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects.

Having a easier summer project not only doesn't shift the percentage of participation, but also causes a strain in the development or knowledge of the student over the summer. Almost all teachers have witnessed students who refuse to complete homework, thus, they understand that lowering the difficulty would not change participation. This observation causes the teachers to not design the projects in favor of student's emotions, but rather design the projects according to the theory of helping their students.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have understanding about future curriculum and understanding about the actions of a typical student. One of the main goals of a teacher is to assist students or help students succeed in life. Therefore, logically, everything a teacher does is to benefit the students. Teachers, unbiased about the emotions of a student, will challenge their students into achieving high goals. In their best efforts, teachers would try to assist their students in trying to acquire beneficial skills. Teachers understand that some students will try to challenge authority by refusing to complete assignment, instead of signing in defeat, they will persistent in their teaching methods because they understand that defeat wouldn't help the student. Thus, teachers should have the opportunity to design summer projects because they are guaranteed to have design projects that benefit students. Many successful businessmen, doctors, or scientists, credit their success to teachers. The profession of teachers have existed for many generations and have been known as the source of many successful people's success. Therefore, their ability to create a summer project should not be questioned.                 ",5,Summer projects,Independent
28CFE95203D4,"I think teacher designed projects are fantastic. Schools should require teacher- designed project because teachers have more experience and know more about knowledge than students, students will learn more, and there grades will look awesome.

Firstly, students will learn more from teacher designed projects. Students can learn new things just by the projects and different things. The projects are going to make things easier for the students. Also Teachers have more experience with projects and they know if one of there students is struggling on something she or he can put it on there project so they can do better on what there struggling on.

Secondly, students grades will look so much better then before with the projects. The more students do there project the higher there grade goes. Also teacher designed project can help you if you need extra credit and need to bump that grade up. Teacher designed projects are also good for summer break if grades are bad and you need to pass the class. Teacher designs projects are great for your grades.

Thirdly, the projects can help students with there knowledge. If students do more projects there learning skills will grow. Students will have all this new information stored in there brain and when a test comes up they'll remember everything they learned and score really outstanding on there test. The teacher designed projects will help all year long.

Teacher designed projects can be really useful to students. They can help you with mostly everything the project will help bring your grades up, learn new things, and make you smart. Thats why i require teacher designed projects in schools.",3,Summer projects,Independent
479A2864FFFC,"I am very on board with the idea that student projects enhance learning throughout the summer , but should the student projects be chosen but the students or by teachers ?

After extensive thought I believe they should be chosen by the students , but should have a firm rubrick and expectations on how to get full credit for completion of the project.

The thought behind student projects is to help the children continue learning even throughout the summer, so you want to make the project something cool that will make all kids even with different intrest, intrested enough that they will want to complete the project. I feel like if the teachers pick what the project should be about there will still be students who are not intrested enough to even bother completing it and they will see a sharp decline in the amount of students willing to complete a student project.

Now that being said i feel that there is a fine line between school appropriate projects and projects that are not. Students should not only be provided with a sheet that gives prompt ideas and lists what does meet project guidelines as well as a list of things that will result in a loss of points on the project. There are many things a student can come up with such as a photography journal with a paragraph beside each photograph explaining the significance of the Photo , or someone who loves astronomy completing a model solar system with why each planet is suitable or not suitable for life. Give them the option the express themselves through these projects not just throw something together because they want a grade.

I can also see the other side where people say that it should be teacher chosen so that they can provide detailed expectations of how the project should be completed , but you have to see that in a class of twenty or thirty students not all students are intrested in the same things. It will make the student who is not intrested feel left out when they see other people so excited to complete a project that they are gonna wait until the last night of summer and throw something together because it is not something they like. Consider all of the different personality types ? You cant have a one size fits all project because there will always be someone who it does not actually fit .

Thank you so much for allowing me to express my opinion in this paper. I am very aware that not everyone will have the same one as me but i do hope my argument made sense .",4,Summer projects,Independent
13233FB0483F,"Summer projects are a good way to make sure that the students are continuing to learn over the summer.

Most projects are designed by the teachers, and some are designed by the students.

Personally I would like to think that having a project designed by a teacher would benefit me more.

When a project is designed by a teacher, it insures that students know exactly what their teachers want, and makes sure that the students are not choosing extremely controversial topics.

Also, students who are given teacher designed projects, are generally more relieved.

In all, summer projects that are designed by teachers are usually better when it comes to providing detailed instructions on what to do.

When a student knows what a teacher specifically wants for their project, it typically rasises the score of the final product.

For instance, when I get a paper with detailed instructions on what to do, it raises my score.

This is due to the fact that I have done absolutely everything that the teacher is asking for.

It provides me with a list of things that I need to do in order to fully complete my work.

Teachers who design their projects often choose topics for the students to talk about.

This helps with making sure that the students do not choose anything that is too extreme for school.

For example, I typically recieve a paper listing several names of books that my teacher is asking us to read and write an essay on.

It helps by making sure that students don't pick books that are too short, too extreme, or books that are not advanced enough for their grade level.

It narrows down the number of books to a small amount that are all similar in length and that are at the students reading level.

In all, teachers that design their projects, for the students, often give only a few ideas that a student can choose from to use in their projects.

Which, in favor, limits the number of bad topics that a student might choose from.

Students are relieved when it comes to having detailed instructions for projects.

It also insures that the students won't have a project that is either too short or too long.

Instructions provide students with information that helps the student complete their work in time for school.

Students who are given instructions are often done faster and usually have a more developed and completed work.

I, for one, appreciate when a teacher gives me a project with all of the needed information on the instructions.

This helps by giving me a list of tasks to complete.

For instance, when creating a presentation, it is helpful when teachers give students a list of required information that needs to be included in their presentations.

I understand that some projects need to be designed by the students.

Projects that may need to be student designed are ones that include physical activities, and scientific/research projects, which requires students to conduct research and run tests based on what their topic is about.

Other reasons why some people might choose to let students design their own projects is that they may not have the time to create and fully develop a list of isntructions and ideas that could potentially help both the teacher and their students.

In conclusion, I personally believe that when a teacher designs a summer project, it relieves both the stress of the student and the teacher.

Teachers do not have to worry about whether or not they will recieve a piece of work that is too extreme for school, a work that is not advanced enough for the student, or a piece that isn't completed.

Also, the students are more likely to understand what they have to do: and in all, students are more confident when it comes to presenting their topics.

This is due to the fact that the teacher has provided them with the necessary information that the students need to have in order to hand in a complete work.",4,Summer projects,Independent
C4FE46E6BC7C,"The last day of school is the best day of the year for many students. It signals the end of homework, the end of tests, and the beginning of months of freedom. However, many schools require students to complete summer projects over break, hoping they will encourage students to continue to learn outside of school. While some argue that these projects should be designed by teachers to be a continuation of subjects learned in school, it is more beneficial when the projects are student-designed because they allow students to be creative, explore personal interests, and choose a project that will be realistic for them to complete without the resources provided by school.

Despite the strong arguments for student-designed summer projects, many still argue that teacher-designed projects are more beneficial to students. Teacher-designed projects are often a continuation of the curriculum students finished in the last school year, or work to prepare them for the next school year's curriculum. For example, a high school student transitioning from world history to government may be instructed to visit a local government building and interview a government worker to learn about their career. This would give them an understanding of what local government does for the community before they take their high school government class. However, for many students this would be a burden. It would feel like a waste of time if they were not interested in the subject assigned. If students are going to be required to do a summer project, it is better for them to design their own projects that they will enjoy.

One reason supporting why students should design their own summer projects is that in doing so they have the opportunity to develop creative and unique projects. By allowing students to choose any topic for their project, they are inspired to think outside the topics covered in school and produce a project catered to their summer surroundings. An example of this would be a student who is traveling to Europe for summer break. They could develop a project about the ancient architecture of Greece, the beautiful mountain ranges of Italy, or the exquisite cuisine of France. These projects would encourage students to explore their surroundings and bring a unique perspective back to their learning communities.

In addition, another reason why student-designed summer projects are better than teacher-designed ones is that they allow students to explore their personal interests. Without the restriction of subjects taught in the classroom, students can choose a topic they are interested in, ultimately making the assignment more enjoyable. If a high school student already knows what they want to do beyond high school, they can use the opportunity to center their project around working at an internship and learn valuable career skills, or focus it on studying subjects that will prepare them for college. A good example of a student who was not caged in by the subjects taught in school is Greta Thunberg. Greta's work in raising awareness of climate change and working with world leaders to improve the planet was not part of her school's curriculum in any way. If Greta had been forced to spend her free time studying subjects she had no interest in, she would have been unable to explore the fields in which she was passionate about. Therefore, allowing students to design projects that are centered around their own outside interests leads to more rewarding and beneficial projects.

Finally, a main reason why student-designed projects are better for students over the summer is that with the ability to design their own project students can make one that is realistic and achievable for themselves individually. Many students have summer jobs, visit family, or go on vacation over summer break. With busy schedules a large scale project requiring daily work would be too stressful or unrealistic for many students to accomplish. By designing their own project, they can design something that would be achievable for them based off of their summer schedule. Another common problem with teacher-designed projects is that they often assume students have access to the same resources that they do during the school year. Many students do not have computers or internet access in their homes, especially if they are traveling out of the country. A project requiring access to a computer would be unrealistic for many students. If a student has traveled away from home for the summer, a project involving local locations or environments would also be unrealistic. The ability to design their own summer project would be crucial for students in these situations, as they could come up with something that would work well for them.

In conclusion, student-designed projects are more beneficial to students than teacher-designed projects because they give students the opportunity to express creativity, develop unique projects, explore their outside interests, and design projects that work for their situation. Yet, no matter how summer projects are designed, it is important for students to continue to learn over the summer, and throughout their lifetime. Developing a sense of curiosity and exploration in youth will lead to a brighter future and a more innovative generation.",6,Summer projects,Independent
07BD57F7F45F,"Is a student to be trusted with the same decisions as an experienced teacher, even when the decisions impact them? The decisions in question are summer assignments and if students should be the ones to decide the nature of their assignments or if the teacher should still be the one to make the assignments. I believe it would be best if these summer assignments were teacher-designed because teachers understand what students need to learn, teachers have more experience with structuring these assignments, and because students may purposefully make the assignment effortless to complete.

The first reason these summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that teachers know what information students need to maintain a grasp on. Once summer is done, students tend to forget knowledge that is essential for a smooth learning experience in the upcoming school year. This may slow a student down and affect their learning pace which, in turn, may impede the whole class because the teacher may have to spend time bringing the student to where they need to be in the lesson. This takes time from the curriculum and results in the class falling behind in the schedule that the teacher set in advance. This can be avoided if the students are given a teacher-designed assignment during summer so they already understand the learning materials when the new school year begins. Some may disagree with this and say students may research the learning materials that the assignment must include. Teachers, however, are more familiar with the material for they have been teaching it for many years, they may understand what should and shouldn't be included because they have prior experience with the issue. This understanding of the necessary materials that students tend to forget is a significant factor when considering if the assignment should be student-designed or teacher-designed.

Another reason it makes more sense to have teacher-designed assignments is that teachers have more experience structuring these assignments to make it easy for the student to understand. Many assignments given to students by teachers are assignments used in the past because it is shown that they are efficient in making the material understandable to the students. The reason these assignments are helpful is because the teacher structured them to be easy for the student to understand. Teachers have been teaching for a long time and they know what works and what does not work, and they are able to use their past experience from making assignments to determine the best way for the student to keep the learning materials fresh in their minds. Some may say that this is a good learning experience for students to learn how to structure assignments. This proposition may apply to other situations, but it does not apply to this one because students may have difficulty structuring the assignment, resulting in a confusing structure that may confuse the students completing the assignment over summer. Experience is a very important factor when considering if summer assignments should be student-designed or teacher-designed and teachers have a significant and teachers are significantly more experienced than students.

The final reason a teacher-designed summer assignment would be superior to a student-designed assignment is that students may decide to make the assignment easier for themselves. Though they are beneficial, many students disagree with summer assignments because they believe their summer should be an uninterrupted break from school and education. Since students feel this way, they may purposefully make the assignments much shorter and easier to avoid doing too much work. Students would rather take the easy way to avoid doing work over summer, even if this means they fall behind in the school year. Students would argue that they would make assignments easier and shorter because teacher-designed assignments are too difficult and lengthy. However this argument does not stand because the length and difficulty of the assignments are designed to aid the student in learning, the assignment is not meant to be completed promptly, it is meant to be completed over the course of their long break. This pattern of laziness in students is an important contribution to the idea that summer assignments should not be student-designed.

Though controversial among students, summer assignments have a very important role in students' summers, they ensure that students don't fall behind once they return to school in fall. It is important that these assignments remain teacher-designed as opposed to student designed because teachers understand what materials students must remember, they know how to structure assignments, and unlike students they make the assignments helpful instead of making it easy. It is important to remember how these assignments not only impact the individual student, but how they impact the entire class.",6,Summer projects,Independent
32676DEE9A39,"Students look forward to summer time in order to relieve the stress of the school year.

Many students enjoy the summer break between transitioning into a new grade, however students dread the summer project that comes along with the break. Students are assigned summer assignments that are designed by teachers to keep students minds working, however it serves no purpose to students in their daily life. Consequently, students are forced to do summer projects that are irrelevant and do little to teach them anything. Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity, teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences, and students are more likely to complete the project.

Summer projects should be student designed because students are able to express creativity. For example, when my brother was assigned an open ended science project, he decided to build an exploding volcano with fossils hidden inside. He was not a fan of book work, and he had felt his teacher had finally given the students a chance to make something exciting that would surprise the whole school. As evidenced by the example, my brother wanted to show his creative side and give his classmates an interesting show that would excite the class about science. By the teacher letting him design his own project he was able to come up with an idea that would excite people and a display others would enjoy watching. When students are given the chance to be creative in school they take the opportunity because they want to associate school subjects with fun and show off their creative skills.

Secondly, summer projects should be student designed because teachers are able to learn about their students' preferences. For example, if a student designs a project on how height affects a persons ability to play basketball the teacher is now aware that student has an interest in basketball.

By allowing students to design their own project the teacher is able to learn about each students likes and dislikes and what they are interested in. This in turn allows the teacher to make lessons more relevant to what the students prefer and allows the students to connect the subjects to their interests. Teachers are also seen as friends to the students because the teacher expresses interest in the students lives. This also promotes high grades in the class and students are able to have a good connection and relationship with the teacher. By allowing students to design their own summer projects it could lead the teacher forming healthy relationships with students to promote a healthy learning environment.

Lastly, summer project should be student designed because students are more likely to complete the project. For example, my friend was assigned a history time line by one of her teachers and decided she was not going to do it, however her English teacher told them to create a project on any book of her choice and she finished it all in one day. As evidenced by this example, students are more driven to complete a task when it is a task of their choice and everything is determined on their terms. Students are rarely ever given an option on how to complete a project, so when given a chance to have complete control over how they do an assignment they jump at the opportunity because for once they are able to determine and decide what they want to do without the guidelines of anyone else. Additionally, students are able to convey their ideas across in their own way which makes them happy because they only have to answer to themselves and everything is done their way. Students choose not to complete work when other people assign it with stipulations, however when everything is their choice they have no problem completing a project because it becomes a way to express themselves.

Many people may say teachers get paid to create projects and assignments, however allowing students to design their own summer projects allows teachers to get to know students, students are more likely to complete the project, and allows students to be creative. It can be difficult to help promote learning over summer break, however by getting students engaged in the choice of projects it can be fun for the student and teacher. Students today are more creative than ever and it is important to help kids remain creative throughout their lives so new inventions and discoveries are made. School holds the foundation of the future and it is important to nurture the future leaders of the world. Students are the key to the future and innovation and it is crucial people let them have control and feel important. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
3EE81BEC8978,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Many people believe that projects should be teacher-designed but i do not. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses.

First, more students will be into it. If a student does a project on their favorite movie, superhero, celebrity, etc. they will have more fun doing that. Let's say a teacher told their students to do a project on Abraham Lincoln, the students probably wouldn't be very happy about that. However, if a teacher told their students to do a project on their favorite TV show, then I'm sure that students would actually be excited about it.

Secondly, students can have fun while learning. If they did a project on their favorite movie, they could watch that movie and tell the class and teacher about all the funny, happy, and sad moments. You could also learn a lot of history by doing a project on your favorite movie, because you'll have to learn about the history on why they made the movie.

Third, they don't have to be forced into dong a boring project a teacher chooses. Nobody ever wants to write a paper on history and wars. If the students got to choose about what their project could be on it would be a lot better and easier to get a student to actually do it. If you tell a student to do a project on World War 1, chances are they won't do it, or they will put it off until the last minute. A student could actually be excited to do a project if they got to choose what it was about.

In conclusion, Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I believe during summer the projects students will do should be student-designed. They should be student-designed because more students will be into actually doing it then putting it off and never getting to it, students can have fun while doing a project, and they don't have to be forced into doing a boring project a teacher chooses. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
B0AD7021AB07,"Kobe Bryant is known for his signature jump shot, the Fade-away. It's unique, it's effective, and it's his style. In the classroom, every student dreads the word ""project"". Projects are meant to test comprehension on a given topic. The problem with teacher-designed projects is that they are boring and predictable. The teacher-designed projects also have specific guidelines, which doesn't allow students to expand their thinking and express their knowledge in a way they would like to. Summer school projects should be student-designed because it allows students to show their own creativity, the students would put in effort with something they are passionate about, and teacher-led projects are too basic.

Lamar Jackson and LeBron James strive in their respective sports for one reason, their style. If every athlete were to shoot the basketball the same way, or throw the football the same way, then there would be no point in watching the games! These sporting events are exciting because every athlete has their own style of play. The same could be said in the classroom. If every student in a class presented a slide show or an essay for their project, I bet the teacher would fall asleep in an instant! Student-designed projects gives the opportunity for the students to really show their creativity and understanding in a way that is special to them. For example, a student who has musical talent could write a song about their project, or an athlete could make a game for their project. The options are endless! The purpose of a project is to test the students' knowledge on a given subject, so why not let them do it their way?

Imagine sitting through a class where every single student presented with a slide show; It's so simple that a baby could make the same project. Teacher-designed projects don't give the opportunity for students to really show how well they understand the topic. Repetition in the classroom is very toxic. Having the same boring project guideline for every student doesn't engage the students in any way at all. The student-designed projects show diversity and creativity; on the other hand, teacher-designed projects are extremely dull and unoriginal. The teacher-designed projects have such a strict rubric that makes the students roll their eyes. The biggest flaw of it all is that the students are only trying to satisfy the teacher, rather than trying to fully comprehend the subject.

When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. In the classroom, students would put in a tremendous amount of effort if they were given the chance to do a project in their own way. Whenever I get a project assigned, I tell myself that I will start working on it the next day. If I were able to put my own twist on a project, I might be able to finish the whole assignment in one day!

The way Carlos Santana strums a guitar is iconic and infamous; no other living creature can imitate his style. In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting. A teacher-designed project is a vanilla ice cream cone, while a student-designed project is an ice cream cone with nuts, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
28314B1AC842,"Throughout our school career's projects are often assigned to extend learning during the summer break. Summer projects are more often created by teachers. These projects are rather extensive due to the months that are given to complete it. Those who may oppose state that it is the teachers job to create these summer assignments and they are able to bring more structure to the project. Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true.

Students creating their own summer projects can benefit them as students. Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed. After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next. Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students. Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work. Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project. Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again. Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass. Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions. If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year. Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them. Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning.

Through creating their own assignments, students are able to build qualities that are helpful in a work environment. The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticism can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that is helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with school assignments this skill can be applied to any work place.

Summer projects can help extend learning outside of school during summer break. Through students creating their own summer project there is a better understanding of the project but also an excitement to complete it. Having created their project a sense of control over students learning can be gained which is often lost throughout the school year. Those who oppose may state that teachers should create summer projects because they have more experience than students and that teachers are able to introduce new topics to students. Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning.",4,Summer projects,Independent
F5B2DED407D1,"Summer, A wonderful season to spend time with family and friends. when students think about summer we want to relax, go to the mall, and do other events but once we realizes that we have a summer project, most of the time it's notices last minute so knowing student it won't get done. My mother once said "" If you want something done then get it done and show them you're capable"". Since then this saying stuck in my head so it should be student-designed because it can show the skills that they have, it tells the teacher that they understand the project, and students can fun with the project in the short time they have to do it.

Firstly, Every student has their different ways of do things and skills are one of them because by students designing the project it gives students the try to proof them self. All students are talented in their own way. Some students show their skills of they what they know how to do and how they expess it but one thing about skills students enjoy doing them and they can do what they most time.

Secondly, By students designing the project; it tell the teacher that they understand because it's important for the students to key points about project and it shows the teacher that they didn't care about it or they just didn't understand so when school start again the teacher know their strong and weakness so as the teacher they can help the students and guide on the right path.

Finally, In conclusion by students designing they can enjoy doing their project and happy to finish it the frist week they get it and continue enjoying their summer vacation while they still can and a good way for student to expess them self in their work to show the teacher a little bit their up coming student for the next year.",3,Summer projects,Independent
88273D2F8BB4,"Imagine that you are a student in high school and your English teacher assigns you a huge summer project that you must complete and turn in in the middle of your summer break. what would happen to all your plans that you have planned out to do in the summer? would you be able to relax and enjoy your summer break? many students in high school get assigned summer projects that seem difficult for them. summer projects should be student-designed and there are many reasons on why they should be like this.

Many teachers disagree that summer projects should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. some teachers believe that assigning a summer project to there students but not making it student-designed is good for there students because it makes it harder for them and it'll make them learn something from it. sometimes a student will be assigned a project and if they do not finish it there teacher will make that students turn it in and work on it over summer break. another reason on why some teachers believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because a student may not be organized with there work. also, sometimes teachers don't want there students to work on a project in a group with there friends.

Even though some people believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed, students should be able to work on there projects over there summer break by having it be student-designed. imagine all the stress a student may have to go through if a project is too difficult and confusing for them, by making a project student-designed a student will have less stress and will most likely succeed with there project and get a good grade on it. another reason on why it should be student-designed is that they can work with there friends as a group and they can finish there summer project quicker, by doing this a student will have more time to enjoy and spend there summer break with there family and friends. lastly, students should just be able to actually like doing there projects and the only reason on why they would like it more is by having it be student-designed

Sometimes students don't like when a project is teacher-designed and will refuse to do there project, some students also struggle with reading and writing and when there project is student-designed they can go on different websites and search things up that'll make it easier for them. when a student has a teacher-designed project the teacher will most likely not want there students to go on different websites so they can get help and they'll want there students to try and think of everything on there own.

6A273D6F0816,"It's the last day of school, and students are sweating bullets eager for the clock to kick off their summer vacation when the hour-hand strikes two. Suddenly, collective groans echo throughout the entire school when an english teacher hands out a summer reading project. Many schools require students to complete some kind of assignment during their summer break because the school boards believe that it will ensure continued learning. Summer assignments usually ask that students read a book over the summer and fill out some type of summary or chart. Many students have great disdain for summer projects because they can act as a looming annoyance waiting to be accomplished. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students the ability to work at their own pace, promotes interest, and prevents students from copying eachother

Allowing students to design their own summer project allows them to work at their own pace. Schools usually don't account for what home or family students go back to during the summer. A student might go back to a family with elderly or children they have to take care of thus filling up their schedule. Schools also don't account for students who have jobs during the summer. If a teacher assigns a project that consists of several pages of charts, summaries, or questions to fill out, it can slam a ton of stress on students going home to a busy schedule. Giving students the ability to design their own projects benefits students who will be busy over summer break because they can reserve whatever time they can scrap up for making a project that makes their life easier. Although not encouraged, this freedom also gives students who procrastinate the ability to make their sleepless night completing said project the day before school starts less stressful. Since every student is different, every student benefits with the power to work at their own pace.

Giving students the freedom to design their own summer project also promotes interest in the assignment. For typical summer projects like reading a book, students are usually given a reading list of books and they're required to read one of the books on the list. The lists arguably always consist of books that students find boring or repetitive when they go over topics they've already studied in the past. Students won't be interested in works they find boring or repetitive so when they're making a project off of it, words, reasoning, and justification will seem empty and made up on the spot. If students are allowed to pick any book they'd like to read over the summer and make an assignment off of it, their interest and passion might shine through in their interpretation of the material. Some might say that assignments students make up could be counterproductive since they might not have anything to do with themes or topics that will be learned in the coming school year. On the other hand, teachers can simply just note as a minor requirement that students must make one quick connection from their project to any theme that will be studied in the school year.

Letting students design their own summer projects also prevents them from copying one another. One tactic that students will typically use with summer projects like reading a book of their choice and filling out the same chart is to read the same book as a friend and then copy each other answers when they have to turn the project in. If students design their own project, they'll have to show some individuality and creativity on the due date. Teachers will have an easier time telling when students copy each other because if done right, no student should have created the same project. If two students are caught clearly copying off each other on a project meant for individuality, they can be punished accordingly. Everyone will turn something different in at least some way when they aren't spoon fed a big packet and instead get to create their own packet.

Overall, both students and teachers benefit when students are the ones who make the summer project because students work at their own pace, create something they might be interested in, and display their individuality in learning more accurately. Students who procrastinate, have jobs, or take care of family over the summer will heave a sigh of relief. Students will be grateful they'll have a more creative, individual project to complete when they're bored during the summer and not a big, scary one that's due the day they get back to school. Less groans will echo throughout schools when students hear that they have more freedom in an assignment given for what's supposed to be a break. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
D0279F114F87,"Some schools assign summer projects for students to finish before the next school year comes around. The purpose of this work is to push the student to grow and learn on their own time. For example, teachers give book assignments where the student must read, then write an essay about the book. The topic of the summer project may be interesting to some, but cause other students to hate the work. Teacher designed summer projects should not be permitted and forced onto students.

One reason that teacher-designed summer project should not be permitted is that, teachers don't know if the topic they chose will interest everybody. Students know what they themselves enjoy, so why force them to do somehting they may hate. When teachers assign summer projects its interrupts, and steals, the break that students need and deserve over the summer. If the project were chosen by the student then the subject would be something of their interest, and the project wouldn't be seen as such a nuisance. A students main priority during the summer should be to have fun. If a student enjoys the topic that they chose for their project then it wouldn't be interrupting the break, they well deserve, it would just be adding to it. For example, instead of reading, ""Lord of the Flies,"" students should be able to pick a book on a topic they as an individual enjoy.

Another reason that teacher-designed summer project should not be permitted is that, students dont have the time or energy for it. Students who were just learning how to write essays a few years back are now getting jobs and paying bills. Those students, society believes to be little children, are now working twelve hour shifts. As a student, with a job and bills to pay, work is very consuming of not only time but also energy. If a student does not have the time or energy for the project then nothing will get done. But if a student is allowed to pick their own topic then they will make time for it. People make time for things they like, for example, intimate relationships, sports, and friends. Student-designed summer projects would encourage the student to do finish their work, knowing that its something they enjoy.

Although some believe that if the summer project is student-designed then they wont learn anything or grow, but they are wrong. No mater what topic or subject is chosen for the summer project, or for anything in life, there is always something more that a person could learn and gain from it. Students know what they like, so they can chose the topic but in the end its still a project and its something the students must put work and thought into, pushing them to grow. When the project is student-designed the person doing the project would have more motive to finish the project well and learn even more on the topic, than if a teacher designed the project. Having the students interest in a summer project could make them want to learn more, instead of forcing them into more stress.

Each student is unique and likes different things. Schools should stop pushing them complete things that they dont like or understand. One way schools could fix this is by assigning a paper two months before the end of the school year asking for a detailed explanation of what the student wants to do for their summer project. The school or teachers could pick the way that they want the project ot be done but allow the student to chose the topic. By letting them chose the topic of the summer project it would help the students feel less stress and allow them to enjoy their summer while continuing to learn and grow. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
B3341D036468,"Summer-break, which traditionally takes place in June/July and ends August/September, is a great time off, a far distance given from the classroom. Because of this great distance from a learning environment and the fact that the summer break is the longest out of every other break in the school year, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they keep up to speed, with school content. These summer projects are traditionally teacher based, but recent years have given students more freedom. However, these summer projects should remain teacher-designed because of the content covered in the classroom, as well as the teacher having knowledge on what material will be covered in that following year after summer break, given that they actually end up teaching the content planned for that year, which is a valuable insight for the students. Additionally, many students are still in touch with the classroom environment, and it gives a smoother transition to those students who come back from their periodic break.

Teachers in the classroom face a struggle, that comes after the periodic amount of time that summer break takes. What will the content consist of? What will be the new learning objectives for the students when they come back from their break? That is why during the summer break, teachers designing specific projects that aim to target learning objectives that they themselves know, are important for the students to get a grip of, as well as still sticking to the curriculum, which greatly benefits students in the way that they actually get a sneak peek of what next year's curriculum could be built as. In addition to this, students get valued ""class time"", so even though they might be on their summer breaks, and they might not possibly do the projects to the best of their abilities, they are still soaking up valuable education time that you could only gain in class. For example, in schools that do not hand out or require students to complete projects during the time of the summer break, these students tend to forget some important learning objectives, simply due to the fact on how much time students have spent outside of school. But those who do indeed assign summer projects, give students a peek into the upcoming school year, which definitely does give a boost to the students preceding knowledge prior to the school year, as well as encouraging possible additional studying, which all leads to a future of a bright learning environment.

Another important factor on why it is essential for schools to give out teacher-designed projects is to bring out more of the ""integration period"", or coming slowly, back to the school environment in order to prepare them for learning. Teachers find this valuable so that they can get their students ""accustomed"" to their classroom environment before even stepping through the door, which is very precious for most teachers, given that in a school year, teachers take around a month and a half before all the assignments and daily motions become routine. In a time where every period counts, this is a major victory for teachers, as their designed projects can go over and reflect on the material that they hope to teach their students, which gives them a starting to the school year edge, above all. Students often struggle at the beginning of the year at first, because of the time they have taken off, without any classroom instruction, which is also an adjustment period. Teacher-designed projects enable students to take the initiative, while on vacation and step up to learn important material that has basis, and will be taught in class at some point.

Even though student projects allow for the students to choose their own projects, and whatever central topic of focus that they have the most interest in, students will still choose topics that might not be relevant to them in education, whereas teachers have the best idea due to the fact that they, and them only teach the curriculum. In addition, teachers know exactly what learning objectives are prioritized, while students might have a faint idea, but not close to what the teachers understanding of the goals and learning objectives that he might have set for his/her students. Specific examples would include how in English, summer reading projects would be assigned so that when the students returned back, they would have that ""touch"" with their books, and their education beforehand, so rather than deal with the trivial, novel things that teachers would normally do at the beginning of the year, they are allowed to follow the curriculum, full stretch.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects help students due to the amount of content covered in the classroom, as well as teachers having knowledge on what will be covered after summer break which benefits students greatly, and begins the integration into the classroom, before even stepping foot into the classroom. This also alleviates the pressure on teachers greatly, as they can plan more accordingly giving their own designed summer projects to their students in the classroom. Students benefit from this due to how they are accustomed earlier then usual in the classroom, while teachers are benefited due to how they are able to focus on specific learning objectives that might be of importance. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
ECE6DB354262,"Imagine, you are a student stuck doing a required assignment you truly dislike;summer break is almost over and you don't have the motivation to complete it because schoolwork feels like a chore. The information your teacher discussed in class left as soon as the last bell rang in June, so you're also clueless. You might shrug it off until the last moment or just not do it at all.

To avoid this dilemma, schools that require students to complete Summer assignments should give students the freedom to design the project themselves. If students are truly passionate about their work, they would be more likely to complete the assignment. This way students maintain the information they obtained in class and have an outlet to express their creative side. This may also benefit students who cannot learn in a classroom setting due to severe anxiety or other mental illnesses and are confused for the next year. It can be hard reteaching yourself something but not if you put your heart into it and design a project to fit your academic needs.

Teacher's may argue that students will choose an easier route and not challenge themselves. They will also argue they worry that the students wont be creative. To avoid this teachers should create a rubric that the students must follow. This allows the teacher to grade the project on effort, creativity and neatness but also allowing the student to do what they please with the assignment. They may also fear that students might be inappropriate with their designs. However, teachers can discipline them by reporting them or writing them up.

Education is important and Summer projects can be tough. Especially if you're in no school mode already. If students are able to design their own projects they can reteach themselves what they might have forgot over Summer break. Not everyone learns the same so this would give students an opportunity to expand their minds. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
C04E9948DEEA,"Most of the time people are given tasks that must be completed or accomplished by a specific time; however, the task given might not be what one truly wants to do which could lead to lazy work or under achieving expectations. Having that sense of freedom to do what you want is what we all strive to have. The willingness to complete the task at hand goes up as well. Ultimate freedom comes in many forms, but summer vacation is the best example of that especially for a student, and by giving them work restricted to a set rules or guidelines is like putting a wild lion in captivity. Summer projects should be designed by the students because at the end of the summer it would of been thought up, made, revised, edited, printed, and turned in by the student so it's only fair to let them have some fun with it too. It's something about being able to be ones own boss that makes work seem less like work.

Freedom is the name of the game and most people really like to participate. This may seem like not a big deal at the time, but to some people just a little slack off the rope is enough for them to run for miles and they will benefit greatly because of it. My mom once said to me, ""a little goes a long way."" Giving a student the opportunity to talk about whatever topic they see best fits is beneficial because, not only will this make them want to do it, but they will also be able use their imagination to complete the project. Personally if a teacher tells me to write an essay on per set terms and topic i'm going to struggle, not want to do it, and not have any type of motivation because the topic is not interesting to me personally; although, if i'm given the chance to do a personal essay then that is when I can what i want and talk about what I want.

Another big thing to consider is if they are willing to do what you ask of them on the rules pre-determined. willingness to do something is night and day and it shows; for example, if ones parent tells then to clean their room they are less willing and will probable not do a good job at it, but if one makes the choice on ones own will being then they will do it at a high success rate. As of now most people, mostly adults, end up doing what they want later in life because its what satisfies them. if one hates their job they are nine times out of 10 going to find another job that suites them and that they enjoy. By giving the students the willingness to do as they please it will relieve stress and hopefully end up with a higher rate of completion

In conclusion freedom, the ability to think for ones self, and taking pride in what we do is what we all want in life, being able to go to sleep feeling happy and accomplished. By giving the student the chance to spread their wings and do as they see best fits for them is beneficial in the long run, especially when it comes to something as important as school grades. Something as simple as the way the student approaches this assignment can and will effect their grade and maybe even their life forever. So next time a summer project is given just let the students have some fun, it is summer vacation after all. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
D72B8EA15C83,"Many high school teachers will assign summer assignments and projects for their new students to do before starting their class whether it be AP biology or algebra I. I believe that these summer assignments should be teacher designed because they know the curriculum a lot better than the students would, the students could take advantage of to opportunity to create their own assignment, and it would put less stress on the student to have the assignment already made for them that they would just have to complete.

Teachers are specialized in all of the subjects they are teaching students. They have taught these courses time and time again, and therefore know what materials and objectives students should understand when coming into their class or the first time. It is beneficial that a student has a little bit of background knowledge on the class they will now be taking. For example, going into a math class such as advanced functions and modeling, the teacher expects the student to know some algebra I and II, so he or she might give them a packet with some algebra to keep the student refreshed and prepared. Having a student design their own project to allow there to be analysis of the wrong information that may not be necessary to know for the class they soon will be taking. Or, the student does not go deep enough into the right kind of information.

If a student was given the opportunity to create their own summer project, that could go two ways: The student actually puts forth effort and creates a well done assignment, or the student takes advantage of the opportunity to make their own assignment and would create a project that would not benefit them in any way due to lack of effort. Many high school students, like myself, will put in the bare minimum of effort when told to do an assignment, or do anything for that matter. Having the project made for the student allows for the student to do research and find the answers to problems that may be on it. Since the student is not familiar with the subject they are doing the project for, they could lack the information needed in their project to actually grasp the subject as a whole as well. For example, if a student were to be assigned to create a project for history, they could do a paper on an individual they already know in and out. If a teacher were to assign a historical figure to a student, that could be an opportunity for the student to learn about a whole new individual they may not have known anything about initially.

Having a project or assignment already created for the student could relieve a little bit of stress on their summer vacation. Students may be assigned more than one project to do during the summer for a variety of classes they may be taking. Having to design their own projects and then proceed to complete the projects they have outlined for all of their classes could be quite stressful on the student. It summer after all, so students should have a little break to enjoy it. Having the projects already set up and ready for them to complete it would make the life of the student more livable.

You could argue that having the student design their own projects allows them to have some discipline and order for how they spend their time, but it is summer time! Let the kids live it up for a couple months, they will be right back in to the stress of school right back in August.

Summer is a time to allow students to relax and enjoy their vacation. Yet, they do have to keep some curriculum fresh in their minds with the help of summer assignments and projects while other knowledge rushes away through time. Summer assignments should be designed by the teachers so that it is beneficial information being absorbed by the student, the work is thorough and stretches the mind of the student, and allows the student to stay in the know with the right information without it being to overwhelming with having to design their own project.",5,Summer projects,Independent
AEBB0D1C98E9,"Picture yourself in the middle of summer break with no knowledge of how to start your summer project that is due at the beginning of the next school year. Several schools require students to do a summer project so that they can continue learning, even when they are not in school. Normally, the assignment will be created by the teacher for the student to accomplish over the break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because it will be easier for the teacher to grade, the teacher-designed projects will benefit the student's character, and it will help the students be prepared academically for the next school year.

To begin, teacher-designed summer projects would create easier and more efficient grading. After a long break from school, grading projects with no outline would not be the first thing a teacher would want to do when coming back from summer. If students are given a specific project to do, it would be much easier for the teacher to grade and understand, especially when they designed it. It would also benefit the student by giving them an outline of what they need to do and how to execute it properly.

Teachers around the world are looking for ways to improve their teaching. Also, teachers are looking for ways that are more efficient for both the teacher and the student. Projects for students over the summer would help them work on that. Teachers should create summer projects in order to make grading easier and more accurate.

Secondly, summer projects designed by teachers will benefit a student's character. There will be a level of responsibility that will need to be reached by students. The teacher-designed projects will advance them further in knowledge, obedience, and responsibility. Research has shown that schools that do summer projects as a requirement have had an increase in higher grades and basic life skills. Since they will not have to create their own assignment, the students will learn how to accept things that they might not want to. Outside of teaching academic skills, this would benefit the student by teaching them life skills as well. Summer projects should be created by teachers so that the a student's character can grow.

Thirdly, teacher-designed summer projects will give the students preparation and a better knowledge of the classes that they will take the following school year. They will understand what the expectations are, who the teacher is, and how the class is handled. For example, if there is a book project a student needs to complete for an English class that they will take the following year, they will not understand what the levels of expectations are or how to do it properly. With a project designed by the teacher, the student will be able to fully comprehend what the teacher expects and what they need to do in order to finish the project efficiently. Also, students will be able to experience what the class will be like the following year. It will get them ready for the school year and keep their brains functioning throughout the summer break. Summer projects should be created by teachers so that students will be academically ready for the next school year and classes.

Some may say that a student-designed project would be better because it gives the student more freedom and independence to decide. However, it would be hard for the teacher to grade a project with no boundaries. It would cause a carefree attitude for the student, and this would create no expectations, a lack of hard work, and grading struggles for the teacher. Although the teacher-designed project might not interest the student as much, it would give the student a boundary and knowledge of what they are to do.

In conclusion, summer projects should be created by teachers because the projects will be easier and more efficient for the teacher to grade, it will help continue the growth of a student's character, and the student will be fully prepared for the next school year. Not only will students benefit from this, but teachers will as well. Therefore, teachers should create projects to better the next generation of young adults. Students that support this should go to their administration and let them know that teacher-designed projects would overall benefit schools, their students, and future communities. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
D6B4B647FC25,"You ever get a project that you have to do and you never know where to start? School's ending, you and your best mates are talking to each other, deciding what to do in the summer and finally relinquishing the fact that you've made through the school year again. However, there's always that pesky thing that you fear most, school work during summer break. Maybe it's beneficial to you, and they want to make sure you aren't behind in a class or fail next year. But what kind of project is it, is it a do it yourself or a ""do it yourself""? So you're naturally stuck, sitting there at your desk, thinking about how to get this over with so your mom can turn back on the internet to your room. Or so you think, you wouldn't have to be, if your teacher told you what to do, and you finish it without a second thought and it's off until the cows come home. Summer projects should be teacher designed due to most students not wanting any work over break, students might get huge amounts of stress, and students can take less time finishing it.

Rarely students want work over the break, most don't want to think about school work. Yes, work is work and you still have to finish it because school, but no kid wants to think about work during their own break. If it were teacher designed, at least they have some sort of guideline to follow so they just have to use a little bit of their brain. For example, if it were teacher designed, students can look what at they have to do, finish it, and go hang out with their friends. If it were student designed, students would have to think about what they have to do, finish it, and by the time they're done, summer is over. No one wants to have that happen to them, because they want to enjoy themselves and save the project for maybe near the end of the summer.

Stress, something that comes naturally, and something you should not obtain from an outside source. If students have to do their own project, their stress goes up by a lot. When students go out during their break, let's say to the mall or something, they have to remember in the back of their head that they have that project to stress over about. Stress is still going to be there whether or not it's student-designed or teacher-designed, but at least with teacher-designed, it would be a lesser amount of stress unlike if it were student-designed. For example, if students were out hanging with each other, then one realizes they have to go home and finish their project. They get home, pull out their project and if it were student-designed, they'd be stuck there all day, worrying about the project, which adds to more stress. If it were teacher-designed, students would finish in a heartbeat and go back to hanging out with their friends, because students don't have to know what to do, because the teacher told them, what to do.

Time, a very limited resource that you either waste, or spend wisely. It is not something you should be spending on thinking about a project. Both teacher-designed and student-designed take time, teacher-designed just takes less time. You could very well spend that time on doing what you want to do with your time, not something you don't want to do with your time. For example, if the project were teacher-designed, you can finish it whenever you want to finish it and it'd take less time, if it were student-designed you would have to think about it more, which takes more time, so you wouldn't be able to do a good job on it if it were at the end of summer break. Whenever I receive a project, I always say ""why do I have to do this,"" if it were student-designed. If it were teacher-designed, I'd say ""Oh, a project, well at least I have something to follow,"" Also with student-designed, no examples, so more time wasted trying to figure out what to do.

So you finally finish your project, but at what cost? The amount of more work you had to do, the amount of more stress added, or the amount of more time wasted? At least if it were teacher-designed, you can get rid of those mores and it'd just be a negligible amount. So why waste extra time when summer break should be time to yourself, and why worry about thinking on what you should do, when your teacher already thought out for you? Don't waste yourself worrying about some project that you have only yourself to rely on, have a project that's already thought out for you, you just have to finish it.",5,Summer projects,Independent
E40FC88896CF,"Imagine having to complete a project over summer break. Sounds miserable, right? Now think about a project designed by you, for you. I believe that summer projects should be designed by students because it would be in their best interest, would allow them to be more creative and give the teachers a glimpse at their students potential. Many teachers assign projects that no student wants to do over the break, but if the students were to design the projects it would make them more eager to complete the assignment given.

The first reason why I believe students should design their own summer projects is their interest. Teachers often give projects on subjects that their students usually don't find interesting. This results in sloppy, unfinished, careless work that might not even meet the criterion required. The reason behind this is because the students doesn't care about what they're learning. Now if the teachers were to tailor projects to things that students find interesting they would put more effort into what they are doing instead of thinking, ""whats the least amount of work I can do to get an A on this project"". Some people say that students being lazy is the reason why they don't put effort into their work, however they;re wrong because the teacher is supposed to make learning interesting so that students want to learn.

Many students have hobbies and things they enjoy doing. If projects were designed around their hobbies and interests than it would provoke them to do better work. When a teacher sets a template for a project or any assignment this puts a leash on the students and hinders their creative ideas. What teachers also don't realize is that some students use the template to their advantage by completing the bare minimum amount of work. For example, if you're told to have a project with five facts about the solar system you could use basic facts like,""Earth has one moon"" and it would be an acceptable answer. The amount of work that the student has to do becomes way easier because of the template the teacher provided. One great way to make kids be more creative is tell them,""teach it like you've never heard of it before"". For example, if you were told to teach a class for beginners about computer coding pretend you're teaching it to someone who has never heard of a computer before. If a student were to design a project for another student it would be more free form and allow for a plethora of different ideas and make for some amazing projects. Some people may say that students could choose a topic that is too easy or not related to the learning in class, however they are wrong because the teacher can provide confirmation to make sure the project is relevant and difficult enough.

My final reason why students should design their own projects is potential. Students are given a formula approach to learning where there's only one way to get things right and that's by using the formula provided by the teachers. This greatly limits and prevents development of potential. One person said,""schools don't teach us about money because they're training us to be employees and not managers and CEO s"", and I believe that teaching students and project format are to blame. Teachers should let their students loose for their summer projects. When the sky is the limit students love to go above and beyond. These projects would be designed by students without help from teachers. Now with assistance from their teachers they could correct things that the student got wrong, which would boost potential instead of hindering it. Nurturing and supporting students would boost their confidence and hopefully make them strive to do even better with their work.

In conclusion summer projects should be something that students want to do over the summer instead of moping and completing last minute because they would be more interested, more creative and would allow for teachers to catch a glimpse at student potential. The job of a teacher is to help students learn and grow and if they provide assistance, support and corrections of student ideas and project design i'm positive that students would enjoy designing and completing their own projects over the summer.",5,Summer projects,Independent
2272E232DFD6,"Many teachers offer summer projects to ensure that their students will be productive over their break. There has been a lot of controversy on if students should be the ones to create the summer assignments or if teachers should create them. Summer projects can be a great benefit for students next years in school, with this said teachers should be the ones to make the summer projects because, they have more knowledge on the information they hand out and it would make it easier for them to grade. Having teachers make the summer assignments not only benefits the teacher but it also benefits the student.

Summer projects are important to have, it would be best if they were created by someone who would have a lot of knowledge on the topic of the project, which would be a teacher. If students were to create the projects they wouldn't know what to make it about, students arent as educated as teachers are. Teachers have the benefit of the doubt because they know what they need their students to learn. A project wouldn't be very helpful if it was made by someone who didn't know much about what the project was on. Having experience and knowledge with a topic is very important when it comes to making a project.

Summer projects should be created by teachers because they have more knowledge and its easier for teachers to grade then students. Grades are very important to many students lives and they will do anything to see a ""A"" on there report card. With this said students shouldn't be the ones to create their summer assignments because, they would make it really easy just to get a good grade. Summer projects shouldn't be made just to get a good grade, they should be made to help you understand and remember the things you learned from the past year. Having teachers create summer projects is the best option because they wouldn't make it easy just so the class could get a good grade, they would make it so it benefit each of the students. This would also benefit the teacher because it would make it easier for them to grade each project since they made the project themselves and understand the topic.

With all of the different controversy on if students should be the ones who make the summer projects or if teachers should be the one, teachers are the best choice. Teachers do have a lot of good evidence to why they should be the project designers but, students wouldnt be a bad option either. Students have a bunch of free time over the summer compared to teachers where they might take on another job and be busy with that. With students having a bunch of free time over their summer break they can have more time to make and work on their summer projects. If summer assignments were created by the student it could benefit the student more because, they know what they need to still learn or review. Although, students have good reasons to why they should be the projects designers, teachers are still the best fit for the position.

Some schools require summer assignments and some schools don't but if there was a option if students should create the assignments of if teachers should, teachers would be the best choice. Teachers have the most knowledge on the topics they want to teach and they would be able to grade more efficient. Summer projects are meant to be beneficial to not only the student but to the teachers too. With teachers being the project designer they can make sure the project is high quality with information that will benefit each student. Therefore, summer projects should be made by teachers. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
52145F7349A8,"The summer time is a time of relaxation and enjoyment for school students. Projects take up free time and when the teacher makes a project the students feel forced to complete it. When a students gets to choose the project at hand they will feel less forced, less stressed, and less like the school takes up the summer. Teachers should not choose the project for the summer.

Deciding what a student has to do a project on makes them feel forced. A student feels that there is nothing they can do until the project is completed. When the students get to pick a project there is a feeling of freedom. The choice is not forced; therefore, students feel more at ease with the project. Not only does the project feel forced, a chosen project can put extra stress on a student.

Students may already feel stressed in school, so why add onto the stress over the summer? A teacher chosen project adds stress to a summer that should feel relaxed. A student that picks their own project can lessen the stress from schools. Students do not have to feel that a project is the only thing to do for summer break. Stress can ruin a summer break and also cause the student to possibly not do as well as they would if they could pick their own project. Students may also feel forced to do the project.

Feeling forced to do a project can destroy a summer break. The only thing that students may feel they can do is the project. When teaches pick the project the students feel they have to complete it or they will fail the class. When this happens it takes all the fun from a summer break away. Students parents may also tell them that the project needs to be done before they can do anything. Feeling forced to do anything can make performance very bad.

In conclusion, when a project is required over the summer; the students should get the choice. Choosing the project can make it feel less forced onto the students, lower stress from school, and stop school from taking up the summer. Teachers should not choose the project for students. Students will feel better when the project is their choice. This will make all the students feel better for picking their own project.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9C95AF195D21,"Summer projects are an activity that every student dreads. These projects are a common practice by schools to prepare students for the upcoming school year. Many schools debate whether summer-projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects need to be student-designed because it helps students retain forgotten information, allows students to prepare for the upcoming school year, and it keeps students busy throughout the summer.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to retain forgotten information from the previous school year. Subjects including math or science require concepts to be retained because they build off of each other. For example, it is required for students to remember Algebra 1 to succeed in Algebra 2. This sets up students for success so they are not lost when they enter the school year. Going along with that, teachers don't always have enough time in the year to go over forgotten concepts. A lot of school subjects go at a fast pace and have a lot of content to go over. This doesn't allow teachers to go over concepts from prior years. Making school projects student-designed will set up students for success because they have that prior knowledge to build off. When students retain information from the previous year, it gives them confidence when tackling new concepts. Schools try their best to give students confidence so they can perform to the best of their abilities. Their confidence can be damaged when they don't remember concepts from the previous year which goes into learning new subjects. This hinders their ability to succeed in school. Making summer projects student-designed will help them remember past concepts, which will increase student confidence during the school year.

Going along with that, making summer projects student-designed will give them an idea about the skills they need to know for the next school year. Before students enter a class, they may feel anxious about the difficulty of the class. Students may not necessarily know what a specific class is expecting from them. Making summer projects student-designed will give students an idea about the expectations of a particular class. This will reduce the anxiety faced by students because they already have an idea about the kind of work assigned in that class. Students will also get a head start on concepts learned for the next school year. When students enter school, they won't be confused when they start to learn because they already had practice on these concepts on the summer project. This makes academics much easier for students and allows them to have an understand even before the upcoming school year. Furthermore, if students are prepared for concepts learned for the next school year, it will remove the negative connotation that students have with school. Students often don't like school because it is challenging or they do not understand what is being taught. If schools assigned a summer project to students, it will help students think positively about school. This will allow students to enjoy the subject they are learning because they will not be lost trying to grasp the new concepts.

Allowing summer projects to be student-designed will keep students busy throughout the summer. Students often face laziness and boredom throughout the summer because they have no work to do. Making summer projects student-designed will prevent students from laziness and actually give them something to do. Keeping students busy during the summer will give them a better transition into the school year. Often, students are not prepared to work again due to having three months off. This makes the transition into school difficult for students because they are used to having that time off. If school projects were student-based, students would have an easier transition into school because they would already be used to working during the summer. Keeping students busy during the summer will benefit their work habits when entering the school year. Furthermore, keeping students busy with summer projects will keep their brains working. It is important that students brains are still active throughout the summer so they can be mentally prepared for the next school year. It is important for students to stay busy throughout the summer so skills such a problem solving aren't lost. Skills such as problem solving are important for student because it not only helps them in school, but in their personal lives as well. Students need to get used to staying busy in the summer because it will prepare them for a real world job. Students need to keep their brains engaged, which is why making summer projects student-based will keep them physically and mentally active.

Remembering information from previous school years, learning concepts for the upcoming school year, and keeping students busy are all valid arguments as to why summer projects should be student-designed. Making school projects teacher-designed will not benefit students in any way because they will not have the experience necessary to succeed in the upcoming school year. Teachers are already trained on how to teach so it would be unnecessary for them to be teacher-based. Going along with that, students need to realize that summer projects are not a punishment. Their purpose is so students understand concepts for the next school year and help them develop into successful citizens. Later in life, students will thank schools for these projects because it will provide students the necessary resources to live a beneficial life.",6,Summer projects,Independent
D1AC5052EF9B,"My grandfather would always say ""creativity is done by the person on what they decide to do, not what others want them to do."" The summer projects should be student-designed. One can use their imagination, and one can never know what amazing and jaw dropping projects the student might come up with. If a student is forced to make a project that the teacher designed, one might be limited on what they could create. Summer projects should student orientated; they could be creative and not be so limited.

Firstly, student might find it difficult to be creative if the project is teacher-designed. Students might see it as boring project and might not even do it, or might come out very uninteresting for others. For instance, a friend of mine made project for science and the students got to chose what to do. He created a sword, in which only works on specific people, can enable a person to drain or give someones energy or make them weak. It was incredible and something a scientist or any other person would dream of existing. One could see the other side and having the project being teacher orientated. Maybe it would make it easier to grade. A student from a different class made a volcano for his science class because the teacher told them to make one, and it was good but very unoriginal and used a lot. One can unlock a lot from their brains, if one isn't made to do something their not interested in.

Consequently, the projects from the student might not be as fascinating. Student would probably find it stressful because their might be limitation on what they can create. Most of the student, find it irritating, if a project is designed by the teacher. A lot of them might even over think it. For example, a senior last year had a summer project and it was teacher-designed project. He was struggling on it and he said "" I do not have the freedom to make what I want and I feel restricted."" At the end, he ended up not doing it and his grade dropped massively. Teachers need let student express them selves and let the students be free.

Morale of the story, teacher-designed projects are not a good idea. All the student creativity would be locked and the project might end up boring and unoriginal. Students might over think it and not do it, consequently will impact their grade. The student need to be free and express them selves. Having limitations would most likely result in the student struggling and stressing out.",4,Summer projects,Independent
302DC21A6DEE,"Have you ever been in a situation where you were excited to start a project but found out it was designed by your teacher who is very uncreative, because I have! Summer projects should be student-designed because students can embrace their creativity and can also be a great chance to learn how to complete things on their own. There was a time when my class had to complete a project that was teacher-designed, which dis-encouraged students to even start the project because the teachers choice of design was not creative, but more basic and boring. When students have the opportunity to create something, they really tend to express themselves more and may even be delighted to complete the task. This shows that when teachers assign something that was created with their own personal ideas and designs, it can really take away the great experience students have when they create something with their own ideas.

Some people may say teachers should be the only ones to design things for students for a better learning experience, however they are wrong because students will never get anywhere in life when things are half way completed for them. Recalling the well known phrase ""getting hand fed will get you nowhere"", students should always have the opportunity to do things on their own because they can get the chance to learn and grow from their own mistakes. When teachers actually give the students an opportunity to do something on their own, they may seek guidance but you shouldn't try to wage your opinions and overpower their own ideas. These summer projects should always be student-designed and these are my reasonings.",3,Summer projects,Independent
BC14D201CBF5,"Summer Projects should never be student-designed, strictly teacher-designed. Many students wouldnt be able to teach themselves or even complete their own projects. Especially during summer, school is fresh out and for awhile. No student would wanna actually take their time and effort to work on a school project when school's out. Majority of students would be focused on having fun, as well as being on vacation.

First, students will be focused on having fun and enjoying their vacation. Also, summer itself is a vacation for the students, they dont see it as a time to be working on ""school"" projects when school is out. They'll usually find it pointless and a bother to be worrying about a project while it's summer. Which is a main reason on why if any summer projects are given, they should be teacher-designed. Many students wouldnt be able to be trusted with such a task, also depending on their grade level.

Therefore, all projects given out strictly over summer, should be teacher-designed. Students cant teach theirselves something they haven't learned. That's the whole point of the role and title of a teacher, to help the students they oversee. It could work like, teachers giving one final lesson at the end of the year and they assign a project with the information they had just taught. The information taught should have some sort of follow up into their next class for the school year after that summer.

Lastly, even if the projects handed out over summer are teacher-designed, there will still be a small amount of students who dont bother with it. It's a difficult thing to complete and follow through with, nobody wants to have to do a summer project. That small amount of students who dont complete the project, usually are the ones who are the less educated students. Of course the students who do complete the summer project will be the same ones that prosper in life, that small amount of students who dont complete the project usually sink more and more over the years. No matter what that small amount of students cant really be helped or changed, it's more of a work ethic to complete a summer project.

In conclusion, most students will be focused on enjoying their summer vacation and having fun, which means giving out a summer project will be a problem for most. It isn't like nobody will complete it, it;s just something nobody wants to volunteer to do. Which makes teacher-designed projects the better option compared to student-designed. There will definitely be a small amount of students who wont complete the project, its not something that can be typically helped. As said before it's usually the person work ethic, which can conclude with an unfinished project. Also, any given project over summer should be related or relevant to the students upcoming year class.",4,Summer projects,Independent
9CD49AB8E6A4,"Summer projects are a good way for students to learn and retain information for the upcoming school year. It lets the teachers know that the students took the time out of their summer and learn material. Summer projects are usually teacher-designed however, I believe that student-designed projects are more beneficial. By letting students design their own projects the student will have better time management, skill set, and self-esteem.

To begin with, if a student were to designed their own projects they would have better time management. In order for the project to be beneficial, the students will have to prepare everything. For example, if I was given an assignment by a teacher, I would wait until the last minute to complete it. However, if I had to design my own project I will have to do it on a time schedule. When a student is required to design something, they will take their time to make sure everything is right. That is not the case if they wait last minute. If a student designed something they want everything to be perfect and presentable. When a student has better time management, they will be able to improve their skills.

Letting students design their own projects will allow them to sharpen their own skills. I believe that if students are allowed to design their own project, they would learn more. The students will have to take the time to do the research on the topic before completing the task. They would learn from their mistakes and try to understand where they went wrong to fix it. Also, if a student were to design their own project they would be able to think outside the box and enhance their knowledge on the topic. For instance, if a student were to design a project about Generic_City, they would be able to do an in-depth research about it and learn more than if a teacher were to gather questions from an online textbook. The student will also improve organizational skills. By organizing the project they would put more time and effort into it to make sure everything is correct. When a student has organized their project, complete it, and have a better understanding, they would have a higher self-esteem.

When a student has a better understanding on a topic, their self-esteem will improve. The student would be able to appreciate the hard work I have done to get me to where I am a. If a student did not have a grasp on the topic before, but now have an understanding, their confidence will be boosted. For example, if I was to be asked if I understand triangles in eleventh grade the first time we learned it I would not be confident in myself. However, if I took the time during the summer and do research on it and finally grasp the concept, I would be more confident when it is time to take quizzes and tests. Consequently, if a student is not really confident on a topic they might have a negative attitude on the matter. They might have a fixed mindset and think that if they did not get it the first time, they will not get it the second time. By having a fixed mindset, the student will probably not care and avoid the subject. However, if a student truly wants to get better they will grow out of that mindset and learn.

All in all, students that designs their own projects are receiving more benefits. The student's time management will be better. They would have expanded and improved their knowledge on topics. Also they will have better confidence when doing something. When the students come back from break they will be ready to go the old material and learn new material. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
BE1367FA4958,"Why Summer Projects Should be Designed by Teachers

Summer projects are given out to students for the purpose of learning and devolping over their break. Teachers take the responsibily of making sure their students are well informed and understand the concept of their project before they go. That being said, teacher-designed projects are more likey to have a better affect on students becasue of their expirience on the project in the past and supirior knowledge. Not only would this help students achieve more succesful results when they return, but also give them better knowledge about their project.

One example would be that if teachers have delt with the project before, they must already have a better understanding on what's expected from the students if he/she wants them to continue with their learning. Teachers with experience can also help students by providing them with different examples about past projects, so they can see for themselves on how to perform and accomplish it. This can as well benefit the students on having positive results and feedback when they return. Furthermore, teachers know that nothing new is being shown since they've designed and handled with the project before. Meaning, this will make their job eaier to expalin and assist those who need it.

Another example would be the amount of knowledge the teacher has and provies to their students which can be put for good use when designing the project. They know what their students have learned and the things they've haven't. Gathering all of that information from what they've taught and shown throughtout the school year into one summer project, would make an excellent assignment for thier students to get the best high-learning quality. Teachers designing projects could also mean expecting higher outcomes on their learning skills and standards. As as well as, better opportunities for thier students to learn something they can hold onto for the rest of their lives that could perhaps be very valuable.

With all this being said, student-designed summer projects simply wont give the most learning performance out of a student then to a project designed by a teacher. While they might sound easier for the student to do, they don't know as much as a teacher would. Teacher-designed projects get in depth about the purpose of the lesson and what the student should get out of if it. Meant to give the student the most reliable information and tasks he/she won't forgot during the summer. Specifically designed by his/her own teacher who knows what their strengths and weeknesses have been during the school year. In hopes to create something that'll continue on with their learning.",4,Summer projects,Independent
E827A459B025,"Many schools have considered requiring students to complete projects over the summer break. If required, should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, teacher-designed projects seems like the best interest for students. When students design these projects, they would probably make them very simple and boring, just to get out of work. Projects created by students will probably not be appropriate at school. Also, student-designed projects will not be taken serious by the students. However, individuals may have different opinions on this topic.

When assigned a summer project, teachers should design the project and tell what to do. If students design these projects, they would be very simple and boring, just to get out of doing a lot of work. Students think if they get it over with, they can do what they want the rest of the summer. The purpose of the summer project is to continue learning during the break. Students may do the minimum, which is not learning much over break. Some individuals may say it would also be simple when a teacher assigns it, because every student will be doing the same project, but if the teacher assigns the project at least they will know what the project is. Therefore, there are many other reasons why teachers should assign all summer projects.

Projects over summer are to assure that students learn over the long break. Letting students design their own project, leads to the project not being appropriate at school. Not being appropriate at schools means not educational for school purposes. If the project, is not educational, why design it for school? Many students may think, ""they want me to do a project, fine I'll do whatever comes to mind first."" Most people say the students did the project, it did not have to be educational. If the project is not educational, there is no purpose to design it for school. Continuing learning over break is supposed to be related to educational purposes and not just doing a project for fun.

Student-designed projects will not be taken serious by the students, themselves. If the teacher assigns a summer project, the student will be required to do it, but if the student is allowed to design a project, they will wait until the last day of summer to do it. The students will come up with a project in one day, then do it, and forget about it for the rest of the summer. Some say that students may not take teacher-designed projects seriously either. That is true, but they may also feel obligated to do the project if the teacher designs and assigns it. On the other hand, I think teachers should design all summer projects for many reasons.

In conclusion, when designing a summer project for students, the teacher should be in charge of designing the project. Students should not be allowed to design their own, because it will be simple and boring, just to get out of doing work. Summer projects created by students and not by teachers may not be appropriate at school. Also, student-designed summer projects will not be taken serious by the students. So, if your school is considering summer projects and you agree with the statements above, talk to the principle and go to the school board with these ideas. Let your principle know that teacher-designed summer projects is in the best interest of the student. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
458D4C5C5727,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, and are either designed by their teacher, or designed by the students. In my opinion, these projects should be designed by the teacher. I believe this because teachers are more likely to have more knowledge about the next level of learning than the students would know, and therefore, would be able to put better information that would most likely to be more effective for the student as they move on. Also, the teacher would know better about how much work each individual student needs to have and what their limits are as well. Students could also reach out to their teachers in case the students summer plans would get in the way of their summer project, allowing teachers to know how much the amount of work should be given out to the students so they can both work, and get some r and r. Finally, teacher-designed projects would be most likely be very similar to each other and would be easier to grade for the next teacher, and allow students to recieve assistance from other students in case their teacher is not available for help.

The first reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher usually knows more about the upcoming classes the student will have to take when the summer is over and school starts up again than the student would. The teacher would be able to select the topics for the summer assignment the students would need to know in order to get ready and be prepared for the next grade. In case they do not know what to do, most students would have to take time out of their day to find out about what they will be learning about in the next school year if they are designing the summer project by themselves, and that time could have been easily used to be working on their summer assignment.

Another reason why summer assignments should be designed by the teacher is that the teacher would be able to know what each individual student can and cannot do, and will be able to give out the most appropriate amount of work needed for each student so the student can succeed. Since every individual is different and learns at different speeds and learns things differently, this will allow students to be able to learn incredibly well and be prepared at their own pace.

In case summer plans would get in the way of the students summer projects, they should be able to get in touch with their teacher and learn what they could do to get the project done on time. This could involve less work or maybe a different assignment than what they first received to fit what the students summer plans will be. This allows for students to get a healthy amount of work in the summer while getting rest and doing summer activities.

My final reason on why teacher-designed summer projects would be better than if the students designed them, is that teacher assigned projects could be similar to each student and would be less difficult to grade. Also, it would allow students to recieve help from other students that would help them succeed.

This concludes my essay whether summer projects would be better if they were designed by students, or made by the teachers, I believe that if teachers designed them, it would allow a more fitting learning experience, better information on what students should know, and the amount of work that is needed for each student.",4,Summer projects,Independent
A801F239BB74,"Schools assign summer projects or assignments to ensure that the student continues to learn and develop the necessary skills to not just grow, but thrive in the classes they're taking the next school year. I believe that it is the teacher's responsibility to create and structure the assignments to cover all of the basic skills and knowledge that the student needs to have mastered to start the class with their best foot forward. The teacher knows what the student needs to be able to learn in their class and has a much better idea of how to design a project or make sure material is absorbed by the student.

Since the teacher is familiar with the content of their class it is rather easy for them to design a project or assignment for a student to work on that pertains to their class. However, a student may have a difficult time trying to teach them self all of the material that they should know to start the year, and it can even be troublesome to know what you actually need to cover without the teacher's guidance. For example; if a student were to design a project for a biology class that they would take the next year in school, it would be completely possible for them to miss the mark on the information the teacher was hoping that they'd cover. It makes much more sense for the teacher to create the project them self; although, giving the student a guideline on something like a research project in which they would learn all of the topics the teacher wishes them to cover during the summer is a great idea. In a sense, having the student designing their own project while following a rubric or a set list of required topics would be the most efficient way of doing summer assignments.

The purpose of a summer assignment is to ensure that the student retains the information and is going into the class with a background knowledge that serves as a good foundation for the information that they'll learn during the course. The best way for this to be done is having the teacher design the assignment because of their experience with teaching and their retrospect on how other students did after changes made to previous summer assignments. The student is likely to put in minimal effort into the assignment if they have to create it completely on their own because of how stressful and boring it can seem during the summer. When the teacher makes the assignment most of the students will complete the assignment on a schedule, and by doing this they actually create a stronger foundation of that knowledge because of the length of the time period that they're thinking about the topic. However, a student created assignment will be much shorter and not cover all of the material very well because they aren't sure what should be included. The best solution is allowing the student to learn and teach them self independently at least partially, and giving guidance and structure for another part of the assignment.

Teachers will argue that a teacher designed assignment is the better option because of their expertise, but students will argue that because they don't know the material they should design the assignment themselves. The student's argument would include points like: an argument about independence, a persuasion that teaching themselves is beneficial to their learning, and it can be less stressful when designing it themselves because they can control the length, difficulty, and information covered. Although these are valid points, I still would believe that because without teacher guidance the student wouldn't know what material to cover the student's argument is flawed. The independence is earned by studying, they get the benefit of learning at their pace when studying before and during the course, and some stress is relieved when the teacher lays out a plan for the student to complete.

The debate on whether the teacher or the student should design the summer assignment for their class is an easy argument to take a side on. The teacher is clearly the better choice because of their expertise in teaching and their ability to ensure that the student retains the information is invaluable to the efficiency of the assignment. Giving students the time to teach themselves some of the information is a good idea, but most of the instruction should be led by the teacher so that they cover everything they need to and don't get off track. Although the student's argument does make a point about the level of stress involved, but it doesn't carry as much weight as the benefit of covering everything the techer wants the student to and creating that strong foundation of knowledge for the class.",6,Summer projects,Independent
99EBD3D71311,"Summer projects are often seen by the student populous as a scourge upon their lives, more work to procrastinate on. To teachers, however, they are a tool which students can use in order to stay on track with their education and keep up-to-date information with. As painful as they seem, these projects are created with a significant goal in mind: teaching accurately and consistently. Although student-designed summer projects are often more in-touch with other students, teacher-designed summer projects are tailored to the expectations of discipline and knowledge held for their students.

To start, teacher-designed summer curricula enable the student to learn and apply their knowledge suited to the general teaching style. Over the summer, it's difficult for many students to stay on track with their learning, and it's very easy for them to drift away from their usual learning. Staying on-track is essential for students with good expectations and high goals; these projects can be designed to accomplish this, without any rough beginnings once the semester starts. In calculus, my teacher has very high expectations for his students. Every one of us received a ""summertime fun packet"" to work through over the summer, and it prepped us for the year that was to come: the first day of school, he jumped right into action and lectured to us as if it were the day before the AP exam. Because of his summer assignment's intuitive design, most students were prepared for this behavior, and could take thorough notes on the subject, further proving that teacher-designed projects are more useful to the hardworking student.

Another reason that teacher-designed summer projects are superior is that they are tailored to the unique curriculum the student will be taught with. Any good teacher can deviate from the standard curriculum throughout their teaching, and an assignment on par with the syllabus prepares the student for this ""improvisation."" For instance, my literature teacher assigned us questions analyzing a book we had read in the year, preparing our brains for the material we would be seeing in the year. Although the curriculum calls for practice in rhetorical analysis, it does not discuss proper thesis writing: our instructor assigned us work for both of these. Every dedicated student in the class was not only prepared for the work we were given, but we were confident in our abilities to accomplish these assignments. On account of the deep analysis questions my teacher assigned to me over the summer, I was more able to excel in my work in language and literature, further driving me to learn more and become more accomplished in my English classes.

Finally, teacher-designed summer projects are better for the student because a teacher has considerably more years of experience both learning and teaching effectively. Generic_Name taught us to hold mutual respect between student and teacher; in the best of classes, this respect is still exercised and encouraged to make learning as enriching and impactful as possible. With this in mind, the teacher is also more likely to be accurately designing their projects to reasonable expectations for the student, and to make summer assignments as practical as possible. Teachers are constantly informed on new teaching strategies and the most effective ways for students to apply themselves, and it's their job to make use of this in order to prepare their students for their futures. Alongside personal experience and intuitive training, the teacher is in a much less biased position to be creating work, without personal incentives to lighten the workload or to cut corners in their answers. All things considered, the experience a teacher has in preparing students for class is the most valuable quality they hold when it comes to your workload, far outweighing the experience of a busy student.

In conclusion, a teacher is undoubtedly the best person to be designing summer projects. The teacher's abilities to tailor their assignments consistent with their teaching style, to prepare the student according to the curriculum they are taught with, and to teach according to their own class experiences enable the most practical and effective work a student can receive. It's very important that summer assignments reflect what a teacher produces in their class. Without this preparation, valuable classtime that could be used to frontload the curriculum is lost, and a student will not get enough out of their education as they require to achieve their highest goals.",6,Summer projects,Independent
12156BA6D875,"Summer porjects should be designed by the students because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that.

Not all students understand a project the same, some need extra help understanding the project, everyone has a different mindset. Students would make the project at their own pace, others would make the project fun and not a long and boring one, since its summer it should all be about doing fun things, they would actually understand it since its their own, and they wouldn't hate it as much.

After a long school year students need a break from all of the studying and work they been doing in school, some students have stress from all of the projects that the teachers leave them and they would appreciate to do a project of their own and not a boring project, some others may suffer from anxiety which means a painful or fearful uneasiness of mind usually over an impending or anticipated event,other students might actually enjoy doing a project for once since its their own.

Students usually get summer jobs, since they want to make money of their own since they can't becasue they are busy with school. While doing their project they would bring stuff from their work depending where they work at, and since its theirs they wouldn't have to work hard and maily focuse in makijng the money they need, they may be working to save up money for college since its extremely expensive or help their parents pay the bills its good to start paying bills at a young age.

This is why students should make their summer projects and not the teachers because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that and to be honest majority of the students aren't going to do the project regardless if they make it or if the teachers make it since its summer.",3,Summer projects,Independent
7E8A1EA544E0,"What is a summer project? A summer project is self explanatory. It is a project that is made by students teachers in some schools with the purpose of making sure students continue learning throughout their summer break. When given a summer project who should be the one designing it? Would it be best for the project to be designed by the teachers, who know what is the most important material for students, or by a student, who knows what material is already known to them? Making these decisions may be something difficult to decide on. I believe that summer projects should be student and teacher-designed.

The main reason as to why I believe the projects should be both student and teacher-designed is because in the eyes of the teacher they might believe a subject is difficult and could be easily forgotten but to the students it could be the easiest subject that they have learned. The student could be stuck on a subject that the teacher found to be the easiest one out of them all. This way if both, the teacher and the student work together on designing the project it could benefit the student in the future school year. This process may take more time than it would if it was just the teacher designing it but it is more secure.

Another reason as to why it would be best for the projects to be student and teacher-designed is because of the time it may take. If teachers would be doing them alone they would have to be looking back and forth on what each individual student needs to improve in. On the other case if students help out it would be less time they spend because the students will be explaining to the teacher what they do not understand or the subjects that they struggle in.

If the students were to design their projects on their own there is high chance that they would choose the subjects that they understand. Most students would take advantage of their opportunity on to get an easy A on the project. Let's be honest how many students do you think would willingly be working on a project for school over the summer rather than hanging out with friends or being on their phones. Students don't want to be spending the only real time they have out of school just to be working on school work, they will attempt to make it easy on themselves.

In conclusion the best option for designing school projects is the teachers and their students. In a way students wouldn't be able to copy off of each other because not everyone struggles in the same subjects.",4,Summer projects,Independent
7DB352480689,"Summer projects should be designed by students, summer time is supposed to be a time where students can relax and not worry about school work. If a teacher decides to give a project in summer break the least they could do is let the students design it, they will know how much can they handle at a time and still learn. Each student is different they learn at their own pace.

One reason why I believe students should design their own Summer projects is because they are gonna be motivated to do it. Teacher made projects can be super complicated and the directions given can also be complicated, if students are given the opportunity to design their own project and make directions they can understand they will take time out of their day to do it because because they have confidence in themselves and know what they are doing.

When teachers give directions on a Summer project and give packets explaining what to do, from a students perspective, when they know summer is around they won't be paying attention in school anymore especially if it's the last month or last few weeks left and when summer does start they will lose track of the packet and directions that were given to them. It's different when someone gives you directions one month before summer starts and expect you to remember it but if they are not focused about school anymore how do expect them to remember a summer assignment. They are more worried more about what they are gonna do over the summer when school ends, but if a student makes the directions themselves and the project they are more likely to remember it because they know how it should be done and the expectations are made by them so that when they don't complete it they don't have anyone to but themselves.

I can also understand the teachers perspective, they want the kids to learn more over the summer and be prepared for the next year so they assign projects that will help them and expect it to be finished. They want to help the students meet their goals and expect them to set high expectations for themselves, but when a student realizes the work given over the summer is just like any other classwork they will set it aside. If teachers are able to make a project that is fun and can be beneficial to learning, teenagers or kids will do it and will be more prepared when the next year comes.

Overall I believe Summer projects should be designed by students, summer for students is their time to relax and have fun, but when a teacher assigns a summer assignment students most likely do not do it or keep procrastinating and pushing it back. If the students make it themselves and make it beneficial and fun they will take time out of their day to do it. That's why it's important for teachers to understand how students function, they won't respond to boring assignments, you have to make something that students are actually interested in learning. If you are unable to do that let the students make it themselves. When students design their own projects they know what they want and what they are interested in to learn.

B9BB6A0E2F04,"Students learn better if they are interested in what they are being taught. Teachers can't help struggling students if they don't know what students are interested in and the way they learn best. Therefore if students design their own summer projects they will be actively engaged in what is happening and understand what they are learning. Teachers the following year will then have a little bit of knowledge about what interests students, what will help them be more engaged, and how to help out students if they are struggling. With students being able to design their own summer projects it will benefit both students and teachers because students will be interested in what they are learning and teachers will know what students are interested in so they can help students in a way in which they can actually learn.

Student-designed projects will help increase grades and academic performance as well. With students being able to design their own summer projects, this allows teachers to help students utilize the way they study best by breaking down the way that their project was completed. This is important because once teachers are able to help students figure out the best way to study then their grades will go up and they will be doing good in school. But on the other hand if teachers were to design projects every summer students might not like the specific task he or she is assigned and it will cause them to lose interest in the project. If the student loses interest in their project it will also cause them to not do the project anymore and if it is graded then they will already have a bad grade for the quarter and that is already a bad start to the year. This will also cause a bad reputation for the student as a first impression and the student will not be able to get all the help he or she needs to be able to study well.

School is a main way for students to be able to express themselves through what they enjoy and the topics they favor. Students being able to design their own projects is a big way in which students can express themselves because by representing what they enjoy they can have a chance at being able to learn more about that specific topic in school that year. By doing a project on something that interests you it shows the teacher that you are interested in that topic and that could cause the teacher to want to teach it to the class and you will be able to understand and want to engage in class conversations on the topic because it's something that you would look forward to. This will also help by giving you the opportunity to show what you know and to be able to engage in a topic of your liking. By being able to design a project and fulfilling it, it will also show that you are doing it because you want to where if you were to do a project in which was designed by a teacher, they will not know whether you are completing it because you have to or if you want to.

Students being able to design their own projects will really be able to show whether they are committed to doing a project. It will show whether they are ready for the class and if they would be willing to spend a good amount of time specifically for the project. It will also show if they are ready for college and if they are prepared. Most importantly it will show what kind of student they are based on completion and effort. Being able to design your own summer project is a big responsibility and you need to be dedicated to finishing and working hard on your project not only because it is required but also to help you figure out the best way in which you can learn. Since teachers don't know what students are interested in it would be better for students to choose how they want to create their own projects. Overall if students were to create their own projects it would help identify in which way they learn best, what kind of a student they are, and what they are interested in.",5,Summer projects,Independent
F9D397FC0259,"Statistics state that about 85% of schools require students to complete projects during summer break. Almost every project planned is teacher-designed. Many may agree that teachers should not design these projects but allow students too. Some may believe that projects should be teacher-designed for the ciriculum. I believe that summer projects should be student-designed because they will be more diverse, students are more likely to complete them, and they can understand it better.

Many projects that teachers design may not be appealing and creative. Teachers may repeat the same projects again and again to give to students. Students should be able to have fun and be enthusiatic when creating a project. A great deal of students are very creative and diverse and can show on the projects they create. Students will be able to express themselves and show their ability to complete summer assignments over breaks. It would motivate students to create a great project to present. Projects would be more appealing to students if they were able to choose their own.

A statistic said that over 50% of students do not complete their summer projects. Most of the projects created aree teacher bases. This shows that many sturdents are uninterested in the summer projects that teachers plan. If students were allowed to design their own summer project, it would benefit more students. The rate of students compleating their summer assignments would rise.

For example, students want to be able to have a great time during their break, not be required to complete school work. So having them create their projects would mean, many more students would be more willing to create their projects during the summer.

Students may have trouble understanding what a teacher is requiring them to complete in the summer projects they assign. They also may not be able to contact the teacher, to get information to get a better understanding of the project. Students understand themselves better than anyone else can. If the student does not understand the requirments, it could discourage them in completing the task. So I agree with allowing students create their projects for a better understanding.

To conclude my thoughts, I agree that summer projects should be student designed because they will become more diverse, students are more likely to complete them, and many are able to analyze them better. Students have many ways of expressing themselves through their work. Students creating their own projects and completing them shows that many are interested. I believe it is a better way of learning for students. It motivates students to do better, complete their work, and be more diverse!",4,Summer projects,Independent
FCA264AE51EF,"Summer projects are often used as a way to ensure continued enrichment of American students during break because they have a longer time off. There is the debate however, should the projects be designed by students or by teachers? Students should design the projects because it allows for creativity, is a chance for personal exploration, and the fact that the student is on break would be respected.

School, unfortunately, is the place where creativity goes to die. Students have to adhere to a set schedule, with few deviations and personal choices, where the teacher decides how everything happens. This paired with the fact that schools in America often have the teachers organize their class around a standardized test makes it almost impossible for true creative, educational exploration. A summer project designed by each students would be the perfect way for new ideas to be created and tested. Bringing in and encouraging creativity in the youth is an extremely important part of ensuring that society will be run by people who think outside of the box, who bring new perspectives in. Also, being creative has proved to be good for maintaining mental health. Many times in therapy creativity is used as a way for the patient to be calm and work their problems out in a positive and constructive way. For example, art therapy, which is all about using artistic ways to work through important issues. This is also why, in recent years, adult coloring books have become popular. They allow a person to be creative even if they're not artistically inclined. Considering that many American children, highschoolers especially, struggle with mental health issues, giving them a chance to be creative could prove to be very beneficial for alleviating some of those problems.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it gives them a chance for personal exploration. Youth is all about changing, figuring out who you are, and becoming something new, but in stricter societies this desire to explore is squashed by social structures that rely on conformity. Allowing the students to study something they're passionate about is an excellent way to give kids the chance to develop as fully as possible. School doesn't make for good personal exploration, in fact it's the exact opposite. Students are rarely recognized as individuals, they're referred to as a whole, as if they're part of a hive mind. The rules are all made as blanket statements, one persons mistake is now every bodies. Which, this cannot be held against the school, it is efficient to do things this way, but from a students perspective, it can truly weigh down on them. Years and years of feeling like nothing more than a herd of sheep is discouraging, and that is the reason why many talented individuals slip through the cracks. Think of people who are known for their innovation and strong talents like Bill Gates, Basquiat, etc. Now consider their schooling. Most didn't really flourish in school but rather later on, when they had graduated or dropped out, were their talents really appreciated. So, student run summer projects are one of the best ways to have students explore their interests and talents, while still maintaining the ""this is a grade"" aspect that would curb the lazy tendency to give up on ideas.

The final reason summer project should be student run is that break should be respected for what it is, a time to relax and re cooperate. If a teacher was to set up the project, it would be tedious work because the teacher rarely has a true personal investment and interest in the project they're assigning. There would be unnecessary essay parts and it would be on a topic like local civil war history, something that few children are wanting to spend their summer thinking about. Speaking from personal experience, when a project design is left up to the student, it feels much less like a chore and more like something that they want to do. If kids pick their projects it could make learning something that is looked forward to, not avoided. It wouldn't be fair to students to take what they have always known to be as their time, and dampen it with something that looms over their head, that puts a damper on the whole breaks.

Summer projects are an amazing way to make sure that the three month break isn't put to waste, but they are only truly a positive thing if the student is able to design them. Students designing their own projects would allow for creativity, exploration of themselves, and still respect the time they have off. Yes, it can be said that kids today need to ""suck it up"" or some other entitled phrase that stomps on their opinions, but just like adults, kids deserve to enjoy their free time, even if their regular time isn't taken up by hard adult troubles. Why force students to grow up earlier than necessary? Why not let them enjoy this easier life without a grownup throwing another boring responsibility at them? Children have little say in their lives, they should be at least able to choose how they spend their free time.",6,Summer projects,Independent
F4B17EF5C67E,"The preservation of human consciousness is essential to understanding our universe, this being said I am unfortunately uninterested in this topic because my summer is more intense academically then my school days, but this is a great prompt for an eleventh grade written paper and I will gladly show my gratification for the chance to become a more intellectually stable human being and discover the proper way to advance my knowledge in what I don't know. Thank you for the first steps.

After thinking about this topic and realizing that I'm not in any position of power I figured out that some students are not exactly thankful and do not care about their education even though the learning structure in Virginia is incredible compared to other countries, or even states. But unfortunately too many students choose less significant factors of education. Of course what I mean by this is we don't focus on the most important topics, instead being more focused on the social attribution that the schools give us. In my personal opinion summer break should disperse around the school year evenly so education can be taught all year allowing for; minimum stress, better attention in schools, and so summer isn't the most look forward to part of the year, unfortunately though this will not happen until more students understand the quality and purpose of education. Getting to the point, I believe that students should put multiple efforts into discovering foreign countries to learn how grateful we should be to have a function able learning system.

These experiments should be created by the teachers since they have the intuition to complete a task and will make proper choices to make sure the students arent overwhelmed with stress, but a considerable amount of mental stimulation is pushed into action with each chosen summer project. Unfortunately some teachers may have lost connection to how they felt when they were in the position of the student, but this can be a good thing since the more intellectual discoveries one experiences, the better choices they will make through out their lives, and for the lives of others.

Some may argue that each student knows what is best for themselves, since each person is unique and no one project will interest every student, and I agree with this to a certain degree. So a multitude of different projects should be able to be a student selective of types and display an exciting amount of variety. such as; building homes, masonry work, political and economic trips to different parts of the country and projects that allow the knowledge of how beautiful this world's natural state can be, but it doesn't have to be expensive, it can also be as much as local viewpoints and a reading quota to make sure that the students are involved in furthering their education while outside of schools.

So to wrap this all up with a pretty bow, I believe that students should not be allowed to choose our own path of development, inside and outside of the campus. Education should be left to the people with a strong knowledge to ensure proper development for every student. Thank you for reading and I hope to receive insight on how to better my opinions and persuasive writing abilities.",3,Summer projects,Independent
EDF68039869C,"Kindergarten through high school students go to school for about 9 months with a few breaks every now and then. The big breaks include thanksgiving break, winter break, and spring break but the most important break of all is summer break, which is 3 months and concludes the previous school year. Subsequently following this break students tend to forget most of what they have learned. For this reason some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue their learning while out of school. while the project itself is a good idea, the assignment should be student-designed because it'll allow more free time, allow students to be more creative, and allow integrity to be present.

When summer comes around there is usually a vacation in the plans and if not then pools are open,because of this students want to get out and do stuff and if the project is student made this will allow them to be more free during their break. Usually a project is a summative grade and can really make or break your grade so for the most part students will get it done. Although there would be less organization than a teacher made project this allows students to focus on more than just one topic. on vacation there could be a variety of things to write about or research from the different geographic's to the destination or even the amount of gas it took to arrive to the destination. An important part of the break itself is for students to enjoy them self, with this project made by them they can go at their own pace and still have time to their self.

With imagination comes creativity, these are two things a project needs to be a success. Students will be able to create their own project within appropriate reasoning which will allow them to focus on a variety of ideas. However if the project was made by a teacher then students would be more than likely to focus on one topic, which can get boring and leads to incomplete work. As a matter of fact, if the students are able to choose what they do for the assignment then more students will complete the project by their own will. Throughout high school creativity can benefit you in a big way if this project is student-designed the students will explore their imagination along with their experiences through their break.

Integrity; To do the right thing when nobody is watching . During this break students are left no teacher supervision and they have to complete an assignment on their own, this project if student designed will teach integrity throughout students. with integrity this assignment will create a trust bond between the teacher and student if they complete the project. Eventhough a teacher made project would bring more structure among this project, allowing students to choose their own project is preparing them for college and the real world. For this reason students should take advantage of the opportunity, respect the trust of the teacher and follow through with their project. Doing the right thing when nobody is watching can bring you to success throughout your life, if this project is student-designed then integrity will be shown throughout the assignment.

Kindergarten through high school is about 13 years, and throughout a whole school year we go for about 9 months with a few little breaks every now and then but the most important break is summer break. Summer break is 3 months long which concludes the previous school year. Since this break is for a longer time than usual students tend to forget what they have learned. Schools usually give projects to keep the students learning while out of school. The project itself is a good idea, however it should be a student-designed project because it will allow students to have more free time, allows more creativity, and allows integrity to be present within students. A project during the summer seems to take away from the meaning of summer break, but in reality you can enjoy your break while keeping your brain active so you dont lose your progress throughout school.           ",5,Summer projects,Independent
9987A0266A4F,"Why does everything school related have to be about teachers? It should definitly be all about the students. If they're going to give students projects over the summer this is my input on how I feel about it. Projects should be student designed because students get to show their full potential of creativity and they'd acually want to do this project because it would be done how they want it to be done.

Students getting to show their full potential of creativity would be a positive effect on students and teachers. For example a lot of teachers don't like seeing as much pictures and colors a student would like on their projects. Which causes students to think projects are boring and not fun. There is no student in the entire universe that likes anything boring, especially work giving on a break. So if you're going to give them a project on their summer break. Let them put as much creativity they want on the project.

They'd accually consider doing this project because it would be how they want it to be done. For example during the 8th grade my class had a project due when winter break was over. The project was so dumb we could'nt put certain colors in our slides, and the words had to be in a exact font he wanted. The funny thing about it no one completed the project in that class. This proves no one wants to be told how to do their project. No one wants to be told what they can and can't put in their project.

Teachers are trying to make the project students are required to do teacher-designed. However they're wrong, because if they're going to give students projects during summer break. The students should be able to design it how they want to. Who wants a project they have to do and can't design it how they want to. That isn't fair to the students at all.

Projects should be student designed because students get to show their full potential of creativity and they'd acually want to do this project because it would be done how they want it to be done. So if you're going to require students to do projects over the summer break. Let them do as they please as long as they finish the project. This is how I feel about the situation of schools requiring students to do projects over the summer. Whether there student designed or teacher designed.",4,Summer projects,Independent
8C57C1D980FD,"Various schools agree that summer is the optimal period for learning; however, they are indecisive over the issue of designating teacher-designed or student-designed projects as the prominent method for students to prepare for the next school year. Many teachers spend time creating projects for students to ensure students have an adequate grasp for their oncoming course. Additionally, schools mirror the success of other schools by attributing the idea of summer projects into their own curriculum. Students often procrastinate on summer projects because the summer projects do not captivate their attention, and they view the assignment only as a complementary task. While some schools may argue that teacher-designed projects align with the concepts addressed in class, student-designed projects enable students to discover ideas individually and increase retention time for them.

Student-designed projects provoke a stronger understanding of a topic because students spend time garnering information and relating it with current events. For example, incoming A.P. Spanish students need to familiarize themselves with content which relates to the themes covered in the class. They may design a poster for each theme by organizing current events under an example column and summarizing the most pertinent details found from their research. Student-designed projects benefit students because students are inspired to conduct research on the topic, and students are not limited to guidelines. They promote a higher capacity for creativity because students expand beyond the parameters of the subject and force students to actively engage with the project. The flexibility of student-designed projects can cover a topic more comprehensive than teacher-designed projects because they stretch beyond just the bare bones of a topic. Semantic encoding, the act of obtaining memories by relating information directly to the source, increases retention time because the students grapple with the topic, and they encode the information to long-term memory. By storing the information in long-term memory, students can prolong the retention curve, a graph that depicts an increase in memory loss as time increases.

Teacher-designed projects provide a snapshot of the course because they contain significant elements that are modeled after the course's itinerary. At the end of the school year, tenth grade English teachers dish out a list of recommended books to give students a head start on the book review project due shortly after the break. The book review project requires identifying the author's argument and tone which helps students develop the skills required for the analytic essay component of the A.P. Language and Composition exam. Teacher-designed projects expose students to a strict interpretation which allow students to extrapolate the necessary ideas and disregard the trivial details. They are not intensive to complete because their primary function is to spark interest with students and are merely a precursor to the course. Although they may abide by the topics of a course, they fail to prepare students for the challenges of the course. On the contrary, student-designed projects require huge amounts of effort and incorporate additional information that can allow students to gain a deeper understanding than teacher-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects can limit the perspective of students because they follow the same perspective of the teacher who designed it; meanwhile, student-designed projects can allow students to gain a global perspective of the topic and de-emphasize the focus of students on themselves but on other issues occurring throughout the world.

Although schools utilize teacher-designed projects for summer learning because they stay within the confines of the teacher's syllabus, student-designed projects are ideal in fostering intellectual growth for students because students are permitted to seek a plethora of sources which enhances their learning and they strengthen their retention of the subject due to constant exposure with the material. In a foreign language class, students are given the opportunity to design their own projects. As such, they expand on their Spanish comprehension because they rely on their own research to provide prototypes that can be incorporated into the course, and their homework is easier because they can cite current events as examples in their essays. In an English class, students are given a teacher-designed project to experience the superficial concepts of the course. The lack of challenge offered by teacher-designed projects is devastating to a student's mastery of a course and impacts the view that students have on a topic because they may be biased at a certain topic. One effective way to implement student-designed projects is to provide a list of the topics covered in a course and allow students to approach the project by choosing the format that suits them rather than a rigid structure that may put off students from completing the task.                 ",6,Summer projects,Independent
C4118746172C,"In order to assure that students are learning over the summer, some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break. Some people believe that summer projects should be student-designed, while others believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed.

First of all, if projects are student-designed, then the students will actually want to do the project and learn things from it. For example, most of the time when teachers give students projects, they are pretty boring and students don't want to do them. When students create their own projects, it gives them a little more motivation to do them because they're allowed to do it on whatever topic they want to.

Secondly, if summer projects are student-designed, then students won't be as stressed about the project as they would if it were the teacher's project. For example, the projects teachers give students are sometimes hard and it makes the students stress and struggle to get it done. When students create their own projects, it's less stressful because they get to choose what topic the project is about.

Although these views are correct, there are some who disagree. Some people believe that students don't learn when creating their own projects to do. They also believe that students aren't capable of doing their own project without the assistance of a teacher. However, students technically do learn because when they are doing research about their project, they are reading and learning things about it. Also, if the students need help with their project, they can get the help they need from a parent, friend, or a family member.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed. When students design their own projects, it is easier for them and it motivates them to want to learn. Although some people may disagree, these views are correct. Students that create their own projects are less stressed out about the summer projects, therefore making them more likely to succeed on their summer project.",4,Summer projects,Independent
D463BB44024B,"Today, students go to school to pass, rather, than to learn. Students' views have changed because children have lost motivation. They see school as rather a task than something that will help them in the future. I, for one, see school as more of a prison. My assignments are chosen for me and I am forced to go to school from September to June. The break I look forward to, summer, is a time for relaxation and fun. A school project during summer, for learning, is anything but fun, unless it could be. A student-designed project would allow students to express their themselves in a different way, get more freedom from their teachers, and bring change and fun to a student, during their well deserved break.

In school, students are rarely able to show their creativity and passions through the set curriculum. Students' identities are set based on whether, how well they do or do not do in school. Teachers do not get to see their students' strengths outside of how, ""book smart"" they are. Student-designed projects, however, would be able to change this. Through student-designed projects, students would be able to show a different side of them self. A side that shows their passion for helping others, who do not have the same opportunities as them, rather than reading a book written by Shakespeare, or a side that likes to learn about the environment, and how to protect our Earth, rather than writing an essay about politics. Students will feel better if they know that their teachers and schools are genuinely interested in them. Students need to know that they are cared for and that someone is interested in seeing them succeed. Students are so much more than what they show during school. There is potential in everyone, but students can not show it when they are trapped. Students need to feel reminded that smartness and intelligence is not just based on grades or scores.

Children are forced to attend school by law. We are forced to take tests and do projects that we do not have a say in, or else, we fail. There is no freedom, however, that could change. During our summer, we should get the decision to design our own projects. Our break should not be controlled by teachers like they do normally. When given the choice to do something we enjoy, we will see it less as work, but rather as fun. The common saying, ""If you do what you love, then it will never be considered work,"" is very true in this instance. When doing something enjoyable we often forget that we are doing it. We see it as more of a hobby, rather than a task to complete. While projects should be student-designed, they still can be approved by a teacher to instill that it assures learning. A chance to choose our own path may be seen as risky, but it is really for the better. Learning should be fun and interesting and not a task. We students forget that we are supposed to be learning because we are always being told what to do. Freedom will allow us to see school in a different way. We will feel motivated and interested in the projects we choose, which will allow learning to happen.

Student-designed projects would provide a change for students. School assignments are all given and set upon by teachers. There is a certain curriculum, which does not provide change or freedom. There is hardly leeway for students that enjoy different things. Teachers do not realize that students are all different. We all have our own strengths and weaknesses and different preferences. Student-designed projects would allow students to switch things up a bit. Students would be able to be the teacher for once and do something they find enjoyable. Some students like to write, so they could choose to write a report on something they find interesting, while others may take the artistic route and paint something completely different, but while they are still learning. Summer is a break and should be different than what school is normally like for a student. A student works hard throughout the whole school year, so they deserve a reward or change. Student-designed projects would be something they could look forward to during their summer vacation, and not something they might dread. An assignment during the summer is already a task, so why not make it a fun task.

If a school requires students to complete a summer project they should be student-designed because it would allow students to express their creativity, while still learning, freedom, and change. Students will be more motivated and interested when given a choice. Summer is a time for a break after a long school year, so a given assignment should not be something uninteresting to a student. Learning should not be forced and there are many ways to change the minds of students and how they perceive school. ",5,Summer projects,Independent
690D9455E629,"Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over their summer break to promote learning whilst outside of a school setting. However, the schools are debating on whether the projects should be student or teacher designed. In my opinion these projects should be designed by the student. It would promote creativity within the students. Also it would allow for the students to make a choice for themselves.

Allowing these summer projects to be student designed would promote their creativity when completing the project. It would ensure that the students can express themselves freely while completing the project. The students would be able to unleash their full potential at their own pace. This would give the student more incentive to complete the project knowing that they have the chance to show they can really do. Also it would give the teacher a good look at what their student is capable of outside of a classroom

Also, this would let the students make a choice on their own rather than what the teacher says. It would help them become more independent and self reliant. The students already have to do what the teacher says during the school year, so this would make for a great chance for them to do what they need to on their own time. It would also teach them to be responsible for themselves and for their own work. For example, if the student understands that they are no longer in a classroom setting where the teacher explains everything to them, they will conclude they must rely on themselves to complete the task at hand. Which would lead to more independence rather than depending on the teacher.

However if the project was designed by the teacher it would b a more stable and set curriculum. The teacher knows exactly what they are looking for, so for the project to be designed by a teacher would allow for the project to be more organized. On the other hand, it would take away the idea of creativity and the chance to express ones self had the project been student designed. Which would lead to less effort being put into the projects. If the students are given the chance to do as they please freely they can put more time and effort into it.

Schools allowing for these summer projects to be created by the students would be greatly beneficial. It gives the students a chance to be as creative as they please and express themselves openly. It also is a good opportunity to teach them the importance of self reliance and how to take responsibility. These are all valuable skills that are going to be needed by the students during a later time in life. It is good to get these skills in early so that the students will understand how to use them later when it is important.",5,Summer projects,Independent
BAB28ABA8ECE,"As a student grows and moves futher through there educational career, more and more work will be assigned over the summer.

Durring the summer you are between years and may not know who your teachers are.

This also means that the teachers may not know who their students are.

Because of this, summer projects should be student designed, students can adress what areas they need the extra practice in, have a choice in what they learn, and tey can emprove their learning by doing something they love.

Each student may ave an easier time on one subject over another, the further through schooling a student is the more apparnt this becomes.

Take me and my sister for example, I have a very difficult time in english and history due to the way they are tested apon.

I have a difficult time with tests where there may be more than one right answer in a multiple choice senario.

Finding the one question that is 100% accurate vs. being 75% or 50% accurate is difficult for me.

Thats why I can excell in mathmatics and the sciences, there is only one right answer.

On the other hand my sister is the opposite.

She does extreemly well in history and english and has a difficult time in math and science.

This is evident in every person you will ever incounter.

Each learns, remembers, and thinks differently from the next.

Therefore, teachers, who have never met the students they are assigning work to, should not have a part in a students summer learning.

My class may end up with alot of math practices and very little history, this will help my sister greatly improve her math but I will still be behind on this history while others may be far ahead.

Many might argure that all students should get the same work so it is fair.

This is entirely unrealistic, it is not fair for me to get 2 pages of math and be able to finish it in five minutes while it take my sister three hours.

It is not fair that I dont recieve the help I need in history because my sisters needs were put above mine.

With this in mind think about what school is truly here to do for the young generations that pass through its system. Yes, school is here to encourage learing, but in its basic foundation school is here to prepare us for the future.

Take the book Educated by Tara Westover for example, Tara never went to public school and receved very minial education from her parents.

Thus when Tara entered the real world she struggled grealty.

School is here to take some of this struggle away.

By teaching students skills and trade aswell as math and english.

This is alother reason why summer asignments should be student designed.

By having assignments be student designed, they will learn to make choices.

In the real world you have to make hard decisions and stick with your choice.

In the real world you have to choose what you need to do over what you want to do.

In the real world you have to put in the effort and show that you care, even if you don't.

By giving students the choice of what they can work on, by leaving assignments open ended, it will teach them how to make good decisions for their future.

The level of openness can be decided dy the school if need be but what comes out should be 100% the students idea.

With the freedom to choose what they learn based on their own needs they will get the best education posible.

Every person on earth learns significantly better when they enjoy what they are doing.

Even me, who does not like history can learn it.

I have traviled all over Asia and even lived in Japan.

I lived on a small southern Japanese island called Okinawa.

While I was ther I envested my self into learing everything I could about my home.

Me who is terrible at history can tell you the histroy of Okinawa back a thousand years to when the Ryuku Kingdom was flourishing.

The only push I needed to be able to learn a difficult subject was enjoyment.

When someone enjoys what they are learning and can connect with it they will learn much faster and much more.

By alowing students to control their summer assignments they can learn these difficult topics in a way they enjoy. They may also take a new vew on something, see something from another persons perspective, or find that they love a subject more than they previously thought.

Maybe its through watching historicaly accurate movies like, Hacksaw Ridge, D-Day, Midway, or War Horse.

Maybe it is through fun math riddles and compitions.

Maybe it is by spending the day with a granpa and hearing his accounts of the war.

You can also begin to foucus in or figure out what you want to spend your life doing.

My grandfather was a pilot and after years of hearing his and my mothers stories thats what I want to do.

I want to be a pilot like my grandfather and be in the military like my father.

I only want this because I have learned to love to travil from my parents and the military is where I grew up.

It is apart of me that has only been nourished by what I have been alowed to learn and experience outside of a closed classroom.

By allowing students to design their own summer learning the students will learn to chose what is best for them, adress their own needs, and enjoy what they are getting to learn.

This will open doors for students that may never close.

It introduces them to real world aplications of what they sit in a closed room learing for most of the year.

It can help students interact with others more, causing them to talk to people and make friends where they had non perviously.

Maybe it will incourage students to try something new, weather that be a new sport, type of art, instument, or to try and write a book.

Out of all of this its most siginificant effect is, it introduces students to the joy of learing, how the real world behaves, and exposes them to enumeral opprotunitys that will influence what the student will want to do with his/her life.

0D91FC8A9FE7,"For students, summer projects can feel like a lot, summer break is supposed to be filled with fun times and vacations while projects are almost the exact opposite. Removing summer projects all together isnt an option, so when it comes to the question ""should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed"" teacher-designed projects reign supreme, as it benefits both the student and the teacher in multiple different ways.

As a teacher, your main job is proving students with a learning experience that will help them grow as people. Having a student design a summer project would not be nearly as powerful as the impact a teacher-designed project would. Teachers are well informed and know a lot more than most students and because of this it is their responsibility to provide a student with a project rather then have them create one themselves. This is especially reinforced in younger children, such as grades k-6, as they still need a lot of direction and having a student-designed project would not be as viable or coherent as a teacher-designed project.

Teachers have it difficult sometimes, as they are trying their best to provide students with a learning experience, but teachers also deserve to have their job be a little easier. Creating a teacher-designed project as opposed to a student-designed one, would be far easier to grade and create a rubric for. In student-designed projects you have a lot of variety and no one follows a central guideline, however in a teacher-designed project, you can maintain the variety but also contain a set of rules that benefits both the students and teachers, as the students have more clearly defined rules to guide and provide structure to their projects. This also benefits the teachers, as they can easily grade the assignment and provide a fair grading experience.

Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects. Teachers will always design something challenging and beneficial to the students education. Students, especially younger ones, cannot be trusted to design a project that would be as beneficial as a teacher-designed project. Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy. A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person.

Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart. Because of that, when it comes down to it, teacher-designed projects are generally more helpful, easier, and responsible then a student-designed project would be.",5,Summer projects,Independent
EC347BE5ADE4,"An Essay on Summer Projects

Summer break for students is easily the best time of the year. Summer is time to have fun, enjoy the little things, and get into new hobbies. Unfortunately, these lighthearted and laid-back couple of months are marred by the mandatory summer projects assigned by their teachers. Instead of spending their time going to museums and looking at fossils, or rockets, or anything interesting to them, they're forced to do papers on old British novels about daily life in Victorian England. Instead of allowing these students to pick their direction in life, they're shaped into squares through the way that they're taught to follow instructions. Students should be able to design their own summer projects, to not only continue their learning throughout the summer, but to also inspire individuality, creativity, and even a sense of direction in life.

First, on the nature of summer projects. Summer projects are assigned for a few reasons. They attempt to ensure that students are doing some kind of learning over the summer. They also attempt to ensure that students do not forget how to learn. As for the success of this method, I am unsure, so I cannot say whether or not these projects are useless wastes of time for most students. On the other hand, in my experience, the few students who were told to do a project but instead blew it off, choosing to spend their summer time as they wished, tended to then also spend their time during the school year ignoring their responsibilities as a student. Those who did their work over the summer were more likely to be responsible students, making genuine attempts to learn in school. Through this correlation, one can assume that summer projects positively impact a student's education. Of course, correlation does not equal causation, but it does follow a clear trend.

Now onto my main assertions. By allowing students to direct and design their own projects, students will have to take time thinking of topics that they would want to work on, giving them an opportunity to develop a sense of self and consider their own interests. Time for introspection and the considering of options for the future are often skipped in schools, and the entirely open-ended nature of a student-designed project would be possibly a better learning experience than doing a regular project on it's own.

Students don't often get chances to exercise creativity during school. The only possible outlets are fine arts classes, creative writing, and the rare, ever-elusive, enjoyable project. An ""enjoyable project"" entails choices, certain liberties, and a chance to express yourself through your work. Research is still required, the learning still happens, yet it's an all-around more pleasant experience. While it might be easier for teachers to grade carbon-copy research papers on a choice between three topics, it's not nearly as interesting as grading projects on a variety of topics in a wide variety of formats. Giving the students an opportunity to get to show what kind of person they are and their interests helps give purpose to the projects, and teachers get interesting introductions to their new students. Through this opening of options, not only will the students still learn during the summer, but it becomes a positive experience for both student and teacher.

Through contemplation and research, students are given an opportunity to find something they're passionate about. This can be crucial for a student's development as a person, giving them something to think about and study for.

For example, if a student finds that they're somehow incredibly interested in the formation of lichen, they can load up on science classes and take high-level biology and environmental sciences and eventually become someone who studies lichen to make a living. And that's what school is all about. School aims to get people interested in learning more, and to prepare people to find a career they enjoy and can make a living off of. That'd be quite the productive summer project. An opportunity like that inspires learning much more than, say, reading an old book about a couple of cities and writing a paper on it.

None of this is to say that the project can't have limits, or minimum requirements, of course.

A very rough guideline is necessary to ensure that people aren't hypothetically turning in a project consisting of no more than seven dead mice stapled to a posterboard, claiming that they did hours of research to find out that mouse traps do indeed work as intended. Instead, students should be expected to show their research process, include citations for their sources, and provide annotations or commentary on why and how the mice died. Projects can not be productive if there aren't certain rules and procedures. The issue with teacher-directed projects is that there is no limit to the limitations they can put in place. If the project is meant to encourage students to learn over the summer, why should it be restricted to just a few certain topics? There shouldn't be limits set on a student's learning. Summer projects are meant to benefit the students the most, so why should they be held back from their full potential?",5,Summer projects,Independent
890BA90FED9D,"Teachers are paid to give students their insight, and teach them to the best of their ability. So why not let them do their job? Teachers should design the projects that their students complete over the summer. This is because they are more experienced, educated, and objective than their students. Teachers are more experienced because they have spent a lot more time on the subject than their students have. Also, many teachers have received a formal education in teaching which gives them a better insight on what to assign over the summer. Finally, many students would prefer to have no summer project. Therefore, many students would be bias in the creation of their own summer assignment. Letting students design their own summer projects would not be implausible. However, students would overall benefit from completing teacher-designed projects as appose to their own student-designed projects.

Teachers are more experienced in teaching than their students are. Many teachers have devoted many years to teaching students. These teachers have learned what assignments are most effective and how to stimulate their students in such a way that makes them interested in what they are learning. My English teacher has been teaching English for 30 years. She is one of the best teachers I have met because she has accumulated lots of experience throughout her 30 years of teaching. Student would never hope to create an assignment as well as an experienced teacher. This highlights the gap between teacher and student. Many students would benefit a lot more from letting teachers create their summer projects. Additionally, teachers have more than just experience.

Teachers have received a proper education in teaching their students. Many teachers go to college to receive a formal education in the art of education. This gives them more knowledge than the students in how to help them learn. My chemistry teacher has a bachelors in teaching and a masters in organic chemistry, it felt like she had an endless well of knowledge on chemistry. It would be a lot more efficient to have teachers ,who have spent years learning how to teach do their job, than to relegate that responsibility to students who have no education in teaching. Even if these teachers don't have the best education they should still design their own summer projects.

Students are very subjective when it comes to the topic of their own assignments. Most students would prefer to receive no summer assignments. If they had the opportunity to assign their own summer projects they would try to give themselves as little work as possible. In 6th grade my teacher gave my class an assignment called the ""genius hour project"" in which the students had the entire year to research any topic they were interested in. Many students took advantage of the nature of the project and tried to give themselves as little work as possible. Some students even ""learned"" topics they were already well versed in to try to put in as little effort as possible. Even if this is a small sample size it shows the nature of students and how they are willing to take the path of least resistance even if they dont really learn anything.

In conclusion, teachers should design their own summer projects because of a multitude of reasons. Teachers are more qualified to design the students their own summer projects because teachers have more experience, education, and insight on teaching. On top of all of that they are also more objective when designing summer assignments, especially when compared to their students. I do believe that students do have the ability to create their own summer projects, but it would be more effective to let the teachers do what they are best at. These are the reasons teacher should design their own summer projects.            ",5,Summer projects,Independent
79BF06DEF9AA,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Summer projects provide teachers with a way to insure that their students continue to learn while they are on their big break during the summer thus, making sure that the students are prepared to learn again once the break is over. Opponents may say student-designed summer projects are superior to teacher-designed summer projects since they produce more creative end products or becuase the student does not get confined by guidelines. Although some believe summer projects should be be student-designed, it should be known that summer projects must be teacher-designed.

Teacher-designed projects benefit the teachers in many ways, one of these ways is the ease of grading. For example, if a teacher designs the summer project than all of the projects grades can be based on the same rubric thus making it more efficient to grade them. Another way teacher-designed projects benefit the teacher is the potential for a larger turnout. To elaborate, if the project is designed by the teacher than presumably the instructions will be easier to follow than if the student had to make it up on their own meaning that students who would normally give up and not do the project due to not being able to come up with ideas would now be able to complete the project and as a result, more projects would end up being turned in. Finally, teacher-designed projects benefit the teachers as they are easier for the teacher to design. For instance, it is a lot more efficient for the teacher to type a set of specific instructions rather than a large list of things the student can or can't do for the project because the set of instructions is much less broad of a topic and hence easier to design for efficiency.

Although teacher-designed projects have many benefits for the teachers them selves they also provide many benefits to the students, one such benefit to the students is the easy to follow guidelines. To elaborate, when the teacher provides a set of guidelines for a given project it is a lot easier for the student to complete it since they don't have to worry nearly as much about where to start or how to set it up. A secondary benefit of teacher-designed projects for the students is the new perspective it provides. For instance, the student may already be biased about the topic they are doing their project on but if the teacher sets up the project in a specific way than that may give some perspective to the student and as a result, the student will create a better project. A final benefit of the teacher designing projects for the students is that it insures the students are learning what they need to know. For example, if the student designs their own project then there is a high likelihood that they will design it around something they already know a lot about to make it easier on them selves, but if the if the teacher designs the project than it will push the student to learn new things and they will be better off for it.

Although some believe summer projects should be student-designed, it should be known that summer projects must be teacher-designed. The opposition may suggest that student-designed projects are better because they give students a voice or allow more students to be able to do the project however, teacher-designed projects are superior as they benefit teachers by increasing submission turnout, making grading more efficient, and making it easier to design furthermore, teacher designed projects benefit students by providing easy to follow guidelines, giving students new perspectives, and teaching them what they need to know. In conclusion, more classes should hand out teacher-designed summer projects over student-designed summer projects.          ",4,Summer projects,Independent
BAC5264E2DCE,"At schools, who require students to do projects over the summer, it should be the students who design what project they do because if they decide the topic they will complete it, they can go on various adventures to learn about the topic, and they can have fun with it. No student likes doing work over the summer, so if they're choosing their own topic it would get them to actually enjoy learning about it. Even during the school year most students hate doing projects because the teacher assigns mostly boring projects, that no one wants to do. When they're completing the project they can set up how they're going to present it to. If your school did this, what would you prefer to do?

If the students choose the topic they complete a project on, they will actually think about it and get it done. They can use their creative side of their brain and come up with a very educational but exciting project idea. They can ask they're friends and family to help. They can also use the internet if they don't find enough real life and personal resources.

Then, once the students picked their idea of their project, they can go on various adventures to learn about the topic they need to study. They can ask their parents to go on a vacation or vacations to any area specific to learn about it. When they're in the area they could go on tours of the city or country they're in. They can go see the landscape and learn about the past/history, especially if it's a historical spot.

Keep in mind they're still just kids they need to have fun from the project, especially if it's over their summer break. They need to have crazy and fun nights with their closest friends, I mean maybe their friends could teach them something about the project they have to complete. Hanging around their family at a cookout is always fun in the summer, and their family could have their own knowledge about the project. Staying up all night on the internet may not be smart, but it sure can can lead you to information you could learn for your summer project.

In conclusion, students should be the ones who get to choose what their educational projects are going to be about over their summer break. If they create the topic they will actually get it done knowing that their school didn't give them a boring topic to learn about. They can also go on many crazy and exciting adventures to tour and get information on anything they need. Most importantly they need to have fun because summer is about having the time of your life, but they can also learn about fun and educational topics.      ",3,Summer projects,Independent
6F515B25A68B,"The last thing students want to do during summer break is complete an assigned project for school. Often times students are going on vacations, spending time with family and friends, or even just trying to relax from the previous school year. Summer is an opportunity for kids to explore their freedoms and luxuries of life. Students will most likely wait until the last few days of summer to begin a project designed and driven by their teacher. This then makes the teacher look like the ""bad guy"" for assigning the project in the first place. These summer projects need to be student-designed to give them the opportunity to be creative, have a real motive and passion to complete the project on time, and still have fun during the summer like they would be in the first place.

During the school year, students are consistently encouraged to be creative and think ""outside-the-box"". That creativity should not be stripped away from the students now that summer is in full swing. People often are more filled with creativity during their younger years as children and teenagers. Young kids often explore their creativity by making forts, assuming roles in games such as ""cops and robbers"", or even thinking of new games or toys to play with. Teenagers explore their creativity often by making new inventions, creating new ways to help the environment, or trying to find ways to make the world a better place. These summer projects can be a chance for kids to explore more about something they may want to do and get a chance to find out what really interests them. This can then lead to what their future career choice may be when they go off to college and such. Some might say that the students may get too ""off-topic"" if they design their own projects; however, the teachers can still have requirements the students need to follow, while having the students design what they want to do. Younger students will need more guidance to get started or to know what is expected of them. These projects need to have a main focus of being mostly student-designed, rather than completely teacher-designed, in order to prevent and confine the creativity of our future adults that will one day make impacts on our world.

Real passion and a desire to do something is rare for people to find early in life, but when they do eventually find it, their lives change forever. Steve Sabol was the creator of NFL Films and is responsible for the recording of some of the most memorable moments in NFL history. Steve, at a young age, loved to play football, but also had a passion for film making and art. He soon realized that he had a passion to do something no one has ever done before and that was combining football with the film industry. Steve and his dad recorded the first ever Super Bowl in 1962 and edited it into cool video montages. They did this every following year and quickly gained lots of notoriety. The NFL took notice as well and partnered with them to create NFL Films, which still stands today. All it took Steve was time to find out his true passions and put them to use in his career. Giving students in school the ability to research what they want and produce what they want in a project, opens so many doors for them and their future. The students can design their project their way, which may actually have them be more willing to put forth real effort over the summer, thus giving teachers what they wanted in the first place, students continuing to learn over the break.

One of the main purposes for having summer break is to allow kids to enjoy their childhood and have fun. Giving a teacher-designed project to these kids will create a dark cloud over their summer, especially if it is something boring like writing an essay, conducting an experiment, or creating a PowerPoint. Yes these may be good ways for the kids to express what they might learn, but the topics should be of their interest and not all of the teacher's ideas. I once had to read a book and write an essay during summer when I was going into the sixth grade. It was absolutely awful, and the main reason why was because we all had to read the same book and write the same prompt for the essay. The book was about a young girl and boy falling in love while raising baby chicks, which is not my kind of book. I would rather read a sports, mystery, or even maybe historical fiction novel before a romance novel. I would have loved to complete the assignment if I was given my choice of a book and prompt; however, that is now all I pretty much remember about that summer and not for the right reasons.

I cannot remember a teacher that has shot down my creativity and wanted me to be like everyone else. The job of teachers is to have kids learn and show improvement while having an influence and impact on their lives. These summer assignments will most likely not even be a grade, so why be so strict with them? This can be a chance to change a young student's life and have them start off on the right foot with their teacher. The students' summer should be fun and enjoyable, while still maintaining and gaining knowledge. The best way to balance both of these is making their projects student-designed.",6,Summer projects,Independent
51B8712EF620,"When doing projects over the summer usually teachers or the school districts come up with ideas for how the project should be done. But what if students came up with these projects? Think about how much easier and less complicated they would be. More time to work,less complicated and more easier, and learning a fun way to do it. Students designing these project could make a change and benefit to students all over the world.

Students designing other students these projects would make it much more fun for other students. Other students know how teachers design work which isn't the way they would. Students would make it fun just because of the school year and all the learning you did then. Students communicate on different levels and this is what is going to make it easier for the students to learn. Students are also less detailed than teachers. For example if a student were to design a what, where, who, why, and how questions on a project it would be exactly that, but teachers on the other hand would ask for summarys and larger paragraphs. This way is less complicated, and straight foward instead of heading off in every other direction. With students it's only one direction. These projects would also be less boring because students tend to think like other students and these student that are designing these projects knowing for a fact it's summer time and it's time to have fun instead of being stressed and worried about turning it in on time.

Speaking of time, students always tend to do things at the last mintute, or teachers give them a short period of time to do the work and turn it in. Students wouldn't do that. They would give you the good amount of time to do these projects. Like what was said before, its the summer, and in the summer people travel or people visit other people and this can cause distractions. Students can still give you more time to finish what needs to get done. Therefore, if a teacher were to design this project it would be long and difficult and due within two weeks. Nothing like how students would grant you like a month or two to turn it in knowing that it is the summer. This also means students might also be more distracted unfortunately.

By having students designing the projects they might not learn as much as they need to. This is why teachers do all the designing. Teachers make it harder and longer for students becuase doing it short and simple is too easy and you are not learning anything that way. They also make the deadline shorter because they know students will get it done. If the time is too long the students will most likely end up forgetting about it. Teachers also detail their projects more because the want students to know more than the basics of what they are trying to teach. This will educate the student more, that way when summer is over and the next school year comes around students have it freshly stuck in their heads and will not struggle as much.

Students designing these projects would be a great idea and should be started really soon this will definently benefit other kids in the future. By doing this it will make everything less complicated. This would help out both teachers and students. Because of this schools or teachers mights just change they way teachers teach and the way studentss learn. More time, less complicated, and more fun will helps in a way it didn't before.",5,Summer projects,Independent
F8474CC7670F,"In the summer when schools require students to complete summer projects I think that these projects should be teacher designed, because if the projects we're students designed the projects wouldnt be as much of a learning process then if it we're a teachers designed project.

first of all why I think that summer projects should be designed by teachers is the learning process of the project. Projects are for students to show what they know and learn more about what they have to research and they would have to take more time in finding factual research about their topics. This is good for students in the summer because it keeps them intact with school in some shape of form and it would keep the students occupied rather than them playing video games, or doing some other thing that rots their brain. To add on by teachers giving out projects in the summer will also benefit the students as well. For example my cousin Adam who lives in newyork was enjoying his summer like any other teen would do, well while he was doing what he was interested in doing he also did not something school related all summer such as reading, researching etc this also too a toll on him because since he wasnt doing anything school related over summer he began to lose focus more in school.

Secondly, why I think teacher should be designing projects in the summer is that it gives them something to do while just doing nothing all summer long. Students could be doing things completely different from school during the summer days, by teachers giving out projects could possibly keep students out of trouble during the summer and it also get their next year of school started off to a great start by them doing the projects. Also by teachers hand out projects in the summer shows that they truly care about their students education and would love to see them succeed and expand their knowledge furthermore.

My third reasoning on why I think ti should be the teachers who design the summer projects is that they are not likely to do projects if they had to design it them self. To add on for example if students were allowed to design their own projects they would most certainly become less focus because they would feel like they wouldnt have to do the project as much or take as serious because they're the ones designing it and not the teachers. By the students designing their own summer projects and most likely not doing could really hurt their school life and their start off grade for the start of the new school year.

Although, some may say that students should be able to design their own summer projects because it allows them to show the teachers what they can do by them self, also lets students work at their own past, and wont overwhelm the students because they get to design anything i their choice. This may be true but like I said before students tend to lose interest and focus more quickly if they seem that the task isnt as important to them. So by teachers designing these summer projects would make it seem more important to the students and it would make them want to do it even more and get benefits out of it.              ",4,Summer projects,Independent
F245631F4D97,"The end of the school year has finally come, and you can't wait to be swimming with your friends and family, however , that day will not come. Instead you are assigned your worst fear; a dreadful , hideous , and disgusting summer assignment. When all hope is lost your teacher gives you a final decision.

""Should the assignment be teacher made or student made?""

A summer assignment is a chance for students to perfect their knowledge and make sure they don't forget what they have learned throughout the year.

A teacher-designed project is best for the students , because the purpose of the teacher is to guide their students on a path of enlightenment through the education system, students are inherently lazy and will make an easy project, and it provides the teacher a bar for which a teacher can know how advanced their students are before they come to class on the first day.

The teacher has an obligation for the county and the state, and it's to insure that students are prepared to become adults. An educational study at Yale shows that students who go to cram school over the summer have a tendency to achieve a higher score on the SAT compared to those of a self taught student at home. This is without a doubt, proof that a curriculum and or project assigned from a teacher is best to give a student to insure that they retain previous knowledge and can build off of it. With the teacher giving a direct projection and project on what a student needs to know also helps the student, because the student doesn't have to aimlessly ponder on what the teacher wants them to know next year. It allows students to have a narrow and direct line of sight to their goal , and enables to teacher to have a direct overview on the project.

Students are inherently lazy and result to the easy road rather than the challenging path. If a summer project was Student-designed the project, would be of the most basic and rudimentary work a students would want to finish it as fast as possible. As seen in the daily lives of Generic_School students, in which 65% take non honors or AP level courses. We can see a trend that students are not willing to challenge themselves and would not be capable to create a project, in which the project would be academically sufficient for their studies next year. Furthermore it can be shown on a global level in which the United States is ranked within the top 15 but not top 5 based on educational levels. If we as an American culture can't rise up to be a leading power in education with the help of our teachers, how can we expect student-designed projects and studies to do any better.

A teacher-designed project will allow the teacher to know what level the students coming into the class are capable of. The Generic_School system as had tremendous amount of trouble in which teachers have to ask for multiple planning days. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that students don't knowing the fundamental requirements for a class when they walk into the classroom on the first day. This causes teachers to have to readjust their curriculum in order for the students to catch up to where the teacher wants them to be. A teacher-designed project would allow the teacher to tell the students the basic information they need to know before they come into the class, it also allows to students to prepare their mentality going into the school year.

The development of human society as a whole is told by its children and those who can help cultivate the young. Teacher-designed project would provide students a strong foundation for the year to come, it stops students from being lazy and wasting their talents, and helps teachers formulate a more precise teaching curriculum for their students. These examples alone show that summer projects

9C9986ED9D48,"Everyone loves summer. This is because of the weather, how the environment becomes and also people get the opportunity to explore more things during this season. During Summer, students are given some months off for vacation. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to ensure they continue learning during their break and this should be teacher based not student based. Although some may think otherwise, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know more than students, teachers are also seen as parents in school so it is their responsibility to guide students and also, teacher designed projects helps students to use time productively.

To begin, teachers know more than students. For example, teachers go to college or training institutions to be shaped to become who they are. They learn a lot from their schooling process. A teacher once said, "" A teenager has been a child before but has not been an adult yet"". This shows that teachers have more experience and knowledge so they have the responsibility to give students assignments and projects because they know best and they have been students before.

To continue,Teachers are also seen as parents to students. In school, because students are away from home, they may have certain things they would like to discuss with an elderly person. Who may they as? There is no doubt that the students will discuss with their teachers for help. This shows that a student will always need help from a teacher. Also the same way students go to help from teachers, it is the work of the teachers to give students assignments and projects. All these reveal the essence of summer projects being teacher based or designed.

Moreover, Summer projects being teacher-designed helps the student to use time productively. Imagine students creating their own projects for summer. Do you think it will be of any importance to them? Well, there is no way it will be. This is because, if students create or design their own projects, they may do it anyhow because they are not given any guidelines to follow to make a good project. Students may even get distracted because it is vacation and this may lead to procrastination. If a teacher designed a project for students, they would take it seriously because the teacher is their leader and parent in school so they follow instructions given by the teacher in order to be graded or rewarded for the good work done. Students will succeed if they follow instructions of a teacher than to rely on their own means.

To conclude, there is a huge contrast between a student-designed and a teacher-designed project. Teacher-designed projects are more likely to make students successful and also they learn to use time wisely and productively. This will prepare them for the future to become better individuals. I agree that summer projects should be teacher-designed.            ",4,Summer projects,Independent
34B565833A33,"Summer projects have always been a sticking point for students and teachers alike. The battle has raged on for years about if summer projects are an effective way for students to learn, or if they are just a waste of time. Most students do not like summer projects at all because they aren't designed for the student specifically. Instead, teacher's design a project that they think will satisfy the most people in a given class, and for that reason my position is that summer projects should be student-designed. This is because it gives more tailored assignments to fit the students wants and needs, it lets them explore something they may be interested in, and it lets students choose their own workload.

Rather than designing a project specifically for one or two people, the teacher's goal is to make a project that is designed to be completed by an entire class. While this is less work for the teacher and students, since they are not creating their own assignment, it has many drawbacks. For one, it is very likely that what the students need and what the teacher thinks they need don't line up. This causes conflict between the two groups, with students coming to hate summer projects because in their mind, it's just another generalized school assignment for them to finish up at the one time they feel they can get proper rest. It also causes conflict between the student's current teacher and their teacher next year. These teachers are very likely not working together to make a summer project, so your teacher next year could completely disregard the project that the other teacher gave, and you would have done all of that work for nothing. If it was a student-designed project however, not only would it be something that the student is actually interested in and wants to work on, it would lessen the workload of the student's teachers, as they have one less thing to worry about in their giant pile of stuff they have to do. On top of that, the project can be fitted to that student's wants and needs, by removing certain sections that they wouldn't be able to remove if it was made by a teacher. They can also add their own spin on the project and do it the way that they want to. Those are just a few examples of how a student-driven project can be adjusted to fit them specifically.

For many teacher-designed summer projects, students are usually given one topic to work on. Students do not have a choice: whether they like it or not, they have to work on that one topic. With a student-designed project, they get the freedom of choosing their own topic. This opens up worlds of possibility for that student, as they can now choose something that interests them, not their teacher. This is very important because many students note a major lack of interest in summer projects, so this could be a way to get students more involved. Of course, this subject has to be in the scope of the class. For example, you can't work on a project about the anatomy of a polar bear in a US History class because that topic has nothing to do with US History. So while students aren't given complete freedom with their topic choices, they get a lot more than if the teacher made the project. That's why its important that students work on something that they're interested in.

Teacher-designed summer projects are designed to be finished in one way only. Usually, there is no room for students to cut a section out or do the project a different way because if they don't follow the teacher's instructions then they could lose points for it. With a student-designed summer project, the workload and structure of the project is chosen by the student, not the teacher. This means that students have more power to change the assignment in a way that they believe they can finish it more effectively and churn out the highest quality project that they feel that they can produce. They also have more power when it comes to revising and editing their projects, as they have no guidelines set by the teacher on what they can and cannot do. For those reasons and more, control over workload is a valuable asset for students that is only had with student-designed projects.

In conclusion, summer projects may always be a sticking point for both students and teachers, but there are ways to improve things on both sides. That was is through student-designed projects. Because they are tailored to the students, are interesting to the students, and allow students control over their workload, they are the far superior way for summer projects to be done. It may not be the perfect solution to an issue like this, but it is far better than teachers deciding what they feel is best for students. Teacher's may think they know what is best for their students, but at the end of the day the students have lived with themselves their whole life, while their teacher has likely known them for less than a year. The student knows themselves inside an out, while the teacher gets a surface view of that student. Something needs to change, and the only people that can make that change are me and my fellow students.",6,Summer projects,Independent
11CE345BAEF2,"Throughout the world one out of a thousand students need help on their projects. There is an on going debate over students should complete summer projects to continue learning during their break. Those who disagree, student designed should not be a summer project state over thinking and not going to finish but this not true. Although some disagree, summer projects should be a teacher designed.

There are a variety of reasons why there should be a teacher designed project. One reason is that students have a guide. Teachers will give students directions that may help them with the project. For example, students might need to see how to do the project. Another reason is students can get done faster. For instance, teachers prioritize on projects; therefore, the students can be done faster over their summer break. Also, the teacher may already have some projects in mind over the break. There should be a teacher designed project because students want to get ahead. Furthermore, teachers may want students to finish it to turn the project in on time. For instance, teachers probably want the students to get ahead in there next year of school.

There are further reasons why it should be a teacher designed project. One reason is it helps students understand. In addition, some students may not understand how to do the project on their own. For instance, teachers can help students understand if they do not know how to make up their own project. Another reason is it expands students learning. Some teachers want to help the students; also, it helps the students mind to be refreshed when they come back to school. For example, teachers may want the students to be able to know what they learned for the last few years. Doing a teacher designed project is better because of an easy grade. Therefore, students might turn the project on time after there break is over. For instance students probably want an A at the beginning of their course grade.

Ultimately, although some may disagree, summer projects should be a teacher designed this is the case due to student guide, get done faster, and expand learning. Those who oppose state over thinking and not going to finish but this is not true. students should have a summer project to continue on learning",3,Summer projects,Independent
6C01498EEE9B,"When kids get off school during the summer, it's important for them to continue learning so they are able to go back prepared. By giving these children summer assignments, they are able to build their knowledge from when school ends to when it starts back up again. Although these assignments are helpful, there are different ways that schools go about giving the tasks. The summer assignments could either be teacher-designed or student-designed. Both of these techniques prove to work on the students, but the teacher-designed assignments seem to be more helpful compared to student-designed. A few of the many important reasons why teacher-designed projects are best at continuing the learning process are the students are able to get the correct materials directly from the teacher and students are challenged with the work they are given.

During the summer, if children are given teacher-designed assignments, they will be given the correct materials from the teachers instead of them guessing what will be learned when returning to school. Summer assignments are designed to prepare students for their future classes. Without the teacher giving their future students what they will be learning, it is nearly impossible for the children to know how to prepare themselves for their class. If a student, for example, is taking a math class in the future that has trigonometry in the curriculum, how would they know to learn trig without any teacher reference. With the help of teachers, students are more likely to do better in the class because they know what they are going to face once they come back from summer break. Preparation is the most important aspect when students are going back to school. Along with giving the students correct materials, teacher-designed summer assignments give the kids an opportunity to challenge themselves.

Student-designed assignments, unlike teacher-designed, allow the students to be challenged and improve their learning skills over break. When children assign themselves their own work, they tend to choose easier assignments because the work load seems too much for them to handle. For example, if a child has the ability to choose what to write their essay about, they will most likely choose something easier which affects them improving their learning abilities. With teachers designing the assignments it is guaranteed that the students will be challenged since students have no control over what they have to do. This will benefit the students in the future when it comes to the material they are learning because their learning ability in that subject improved over the break. This will make the students better off in the long run even though they could potentially have a more difficult time completing the assignment. If students had the ability to design their own summer assignments, they would choose tasks that would not improve themselves but instead choose one that is easier so it's completed faster with less work. This does not benefit the student but, unfortunately, hurts them. This is because children will not be as prepared in the class which could ultimately lead to a bad start of the new school year.

Although teacher-designed assignments are very helpful, student-designed work can carry less stress for the student during their break and make it more relaxing for them to complete. Usually when kids get their summer assignments from their teachers, it creates more stress for them when they are supposed to be relaxing from the long months of school. With having the students prepare their own tasks, they are able to pace themselves throughout the summer with less worry on their back compared to teacher-designed assignments. For example, if a student has the ability to create their own science assignment, they can review what they already know along with some new material on the subject which could ultimately bring down the amount of stress put on the student to complete the assignment. This makes their summer vacation more enjoyable along with them having the ability to continue learning without teachers having to assign them projects. Students, when teacher assign them their work, tend to get more stressed of the fact that they have to get it done in order to get a good grade. Student-designed work gives them the opportunity to learn on their own which could potentially benefit them better than being assigned something from the teacher.

Both of these methods are great when it comes to students continuing their learning throughout the summer, but teacher-designed assignments guarantee success when it comes to improvement is the children's learning ability. Although student-designed work does limit the amount of stress put on the student, there is no way to know that the work they assign themselves will benefit them when they return to school. When teachers design the assignments, students are given the correct materials directly from the source and the students have a better opportunity to be challenged; both reasons will help their grades when they go back to school. Summer assignments are really important for preparing students for the future, so giving them the best path for success can be achieved by teacher designing the work. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
0EB16BF9C6D8,"Are summer assignments really fitting what a student needs best? Summer assignments consist of work that the students are requested to complete before returning to school at the end of summer. These assignments are created to ensure that the students continue learning during their break and is a great way to help the students excel in what they learned, while not being at school. There is an on-going debate whether or not these assignments should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer assignments should in fact be teacher-designed, as it maintains the teachers standards for learning, grants the student prior knowledge for the upcoming year, and enables equal work for the students.

Some may argue that having summer assignments that are teacher-designed will be repetitive, not focusing on the students weak points. Though this may be true, it is easily avoided. Teachers can diminish this issue by meeting with the student prior to the school years end to discuss the topics that students needs more or less work on. This would eliminate repetitiveness and cause the student to become stronger in the topics he or she is weak at.

Summer assignments are a great way for students to not loose the knowledge they learned in the past year while learning new things that he or she may see in the future. These assignments should be teacher-designed to help maintain his or her standards. Without doing this, students would just design their summer assignments to require less overall work, having a more negative affect on the student. Maintaining the teachers standards would allow the teacher to assign the topics he or she feels is necessary for the student to learn and is not too easy or unnecessary. Maintaining the teachers learning standards goes along with giving the student prior knowledge as to what they might expect in the future.

Teachers have the best knowledge of what students will be learning in the upcoming year. This is a key argument to the claim that summer assignments should be student-designed. If summer work is planned out by students, they will not learn about topics they may see in the future. Having teachers design the summer work will allow them to include a sneak-peak as to what they may see in the year to come. This is very important as it gives the students an advantage when starting their new school year. Teacher-designed summer assignments would not just give the students insight into their upcoming school year, but also enable equal work between the students.

Students work very hard over the long school year. Teachers try their best to allow equal work for the students so that one student is not given more work than the other. Some students may not need as much work in a certain topic compared to others. Teachers will most likely assign said student different work from the others as it may be unnecessary for that student to focus on a topic they have already mastered. This often creates conflict between the students, arguing that they have more work than others. Teachers can attack this issue by working with the student to find out what best fits the students capabilities. A great way to do this is to give the students work based on what they need to improve on, but making the time it takes to finish the assignments equal. Examples of this include: giving the students that only needs to focus on one topic much more work in that topic and giving the students that need work on more than one topic a more widespread list of topics, but still maintaining equal time it takes to finish all of the work.

In conclusion, summer assignments should indeed be teacher-designed to enable the teachers standards for learning, prior knowledge for the upcoming year, and equal work among the students. This is a very important topic and should be discussed thoroughly when in the topic of summer assignments. I urge you to take this into consideration next time this discussion is brought up in your school or community.                        ",5,Summer projects,Independent
E134EA4073AE,"Summer break is meant for fun and time with family and friends, but students don't really notice that they are losing the skills and knowledge they've collected. They really only care about having fun, not learning. Students always look forward to summer break, but tend to slowly lose some of the knowledge that they've retained throughout the school year. This results in not being prepared for the up and coming school year. Students come in confused and unprepared causing them to fall behind. Imagine coming to school on the very first day and having a hard time remembering certain topics. You're ability to understand your favorite subject has slowly slipped away and the teacher is moving on to more complicated topics. This sets you back and makes it harder for you to understand the new topics being taught. If most or all of the class is confused and having a hard time, some teachers are forced to push back lessons in order to insure that everyone is caught up, while others may just move on creating further confusion. It puts teachers at an ultimatum; Should he/she risk the completion of their curriculum for the new year to help the students who couldn't retain the previous knowledge, or move on knowing that these people may not pass their class? Teachers have found a way to solve this annual issue without having to reintroduce a topic to the class. They have created summer projects. These projects usually have something to do with the new curriculum for the new school year. Whether it's a reading assignment, essay, or even a vocabulary assignment, it is all meant to prepare the students and get them thinking early. A discussion was set in motion on the topic of: Should summer projects be student-designed or teacher-designed? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know what skills all of their students need in their classroom in order to succeed and carry on with the rest of the year without any set-backs or complications.

When designing project assignments, teachers make sure that this project will develop a better understanding of a topic in the student's mind. They base it off of what skills these students need to acquire and improve their class's ability to comprehend the topic. For example, a student wouldn't know how to create a project for algebra 2 if they had just completed geometry and have no background knowldge of algebra 2. They would need a teacher's guidance and detailed directions to complete this project. This also creates a level of understanding for the student coming into the class. During the summer, students lose thought of these topics, but if teachers created projects for them during this time, they would come in fully prepared. Everyone would have an equal level of understanding because they all are prepared for the same thing. Equal opportunity is very important in a classroom because every student needs to feel like they can comprehend what they are learning in order to succeed. If students go out on their own and design their own project, they may not feel pushed to try their hardest. A teacher creates equal opportunity by creating the same guidelines for all of the students. Teachers also have experience with students in the past and know what topic to hit the hardest based on past experiences. They will design these projects to push the class to their highest potential and make sure that each student is taken care of.

Student-designed projects wouldn't be a smart idea because kids tend to do the bare minimum. If students design their own project, they wont know what topics to understand or why they are studying a certain topic. this leads to an unequal understanding of a topic which doesnt help students in the future. They might just do a little assignment that doesnt require much work or effort that doesnt challenge them just to enjoy their summer a little more. yes, some students work hard, but they all come in not knowing what exactly this new year is going to bring. Students should have the right to think on their own and create new ideas, but this should be further down the school year once the teacher is certain they understand what they are learning. For example, in my English class, our teacher made us all read and annotate the same book. once we came to class she gave us a vague writing prompt asking what the argument was in the story. Because we have all read he book and annotated it how she wanted, we were all able to write this essay and understand it. Some may argue that a student needs the freedom to learn on their own, but also need to consider the fact that not every student wants to try as hard or even challenge themselves. This is why students need a guide to show them the way in order to create a better understanding. it's a basic understanding that in order to succeed and be independent, one needs to have grasped some knowledge and relied on a teacher to have given the knowledge. This is why there are teachers in the world. they are here to be there for someone and be there as their guide because they know what is best for them in education.

To conclude this argument, teacher-based summer projects are the best way to insure a student's ability to succeed in their class. It takes out the factor of inequlity and allows the student to hold onto previous and future knowledge. This helps them undertsand what they are learning in class and reduces the risk of getting left behind. Teachers are here to guide their students to success and cannot do so if their students are lost and getting left behind. If it were student-designed, they would be least likely to push themselves to their greatest potential. They also wouldn't know what to study. These points should be cosidered in the topic discussing whether or not teacher-designed or student-designed is the best possible option for a student. ",6,Summer projects,Independent
F2DFE12EA3B4,"Many students have expressed that projects should not be given over summer break. Students feel they should not have to do work during their summer break, Just as much as teachers shouldnt not have to grade papers over their summer break, If summer projects must be assigned they should be student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because the students would know how to complete the assignment, they would also find more interest, and more then likely the project would be completed with effort.

Over the summer most students are sent home with no instruction or contact availability. Students would attempt to do the assignment with no teacher guidance or help from others. With out the proper help the project could be completed wrong and completed with out any effort. When attempting to do my own summer project I stumbled into a problem and had no way to correct the problem, If summer projects were student made there are no excuses for not understanding how to complete the work.

Every student has a least favorite class, many would complain about a summer project from a boring or hard class. More students are likely to complete something that is more appealing to them personally. For example art is a more appealing subject to one, while someone else could be interested in history. Making your own project could be more intriguing which will make someone want to actually do the assignment they have created.

Majority of high school student do not complete their summer project. When a student completes the work it is more for the grade then personal gain. With the option to have students create their own projects brings creativity, interest, and effort. Many individuals put more effort into their own creations like art, putting more effort will cause more learning for the students personal gain, and the projects would be done nicely.

Many schools require summer projects to be completed. These projects would be more beneficial if students were able to create their own assignment. The idea of student designed projects are more beneficial because students would know how to complete the work, they would find more interest, and the project would be completed with more effort put into it. ",4,Summer projects,Independent
54C09D108011,"Summer projects for schools are becoming more popular because schools want their students to continue learning while out of school. Over summer students tend to forget the subjects they have learned. Some schools believe it helps to have summer projects. When students come back from summer break they do not remember the material for some of their classes. This can sometimes be difficult for teachers because they spend all semester teaching it to them. Schools think having summer projects will help with this problem. The summer projects that need to be completed by students should be student-designed because students know the best way they learn, students will gain more knowledge, and student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete.

First of all, students know the best way they learn. Students know if they are better with hands on projects or writing projects. Typically, students are better with hands on projects, but other students enjoy writing projects. I am better with hands on projects. I remember when I was in third grade we had to do a project for our social studies class. My teacher just told me that it had to be on Greece, and she let me design the rest of it. I thought it was easier to design my own projects rather then her telling me how to complete it. Students will figure out how they want to complete the project before they complete it. If a teacher were to design it, the student would have to start it how the teacher wants it.

Furthermore, students will gain more knowledge. Students will actually have to read what they have to do the project on, then they will have to research. When the students research what they have to do the project on they will know what it is about. They would be reading on the subject so much that they would retain the information.

If the project was on the Declaration of Independence the student would have to find out what the Declaration of Independence is. Next, they would have to formulate a plan on how they want to complete the project. They would have to put all of their research into their project. This will help the student to memorize what the Declaration of Independence is. This would help by letting the student get a feel for what the subject is before actually learning it.

Moreover, student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete. They would be easier for students to complete because the student would know what they were doing. If a teacher were to assign something the student did not know how to complete it would be harder for them. The student would not be able to contact the teacher during summer making it more difficult for the student to figure out how to do it if it were teacher-designed. With the summer projects being student-designed the student will know exactly what they are doing. The student would be able to complete it at a faster pace and turn it in at the end of the summer.

In conclusion, the summer projects that need to be completed by students should be student-designed because students know the best way they learn, students will gain more knowledge, and student-designed projects would be easier for the students to complete. There are many people who would say that having teacher-designed projects would be easier. Students do not always complete projects if they get a choice of what to do it on. Students are better at doing their projects off of what they design rather than what the teacher does. Being a student myself, I would rather have a summer project that I designed. I would not want to have a summer project that was teacher-designed.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent
CCAB0FEFDD57,"When you are taking an AP course in school, have you ever been assigned some sort of project to do over the summer to give you a head start in the course. The summer projects are designed to keep a student learning over the summer to ensure they retain the information that they will start to learn about. Teachers believe if a student can continue to learn even while they are not in school, it will positively effect their grades. Although students-designed summer projects could help the student retain information in a way that best suits them, teach-designed summer projects would be a better option because teachers know what the student needs to learn, the students would just give themselves minimal amounts of work to do, and students could start to get bullied by other students if they thought the summer assignments were too hard or too long.

The first reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because the teachers know what the students need to learn. Usually summer assignments are given to give a head start to students preparing to take a class. If students were to design the summer assignments, they would not know what to put on the projects. For example, if a student is preparing to take AP Biology, and the summer assignment was teacher-designed, the student would be given work about cells or the nervous system, while if the project was student-designed, they could be doing work about chemical compounds which will not be useful to the student throughout the whole course. If the teachers were to design the summer assignments, students would have the best chance at achieving the highest grade for them.

The second reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because students would give themselves easy work that an elementary schooler could do. If a student was given the option to design their own summer assignment, they would most likely give themselves a worksheet to do and thats it. This is because when students are on summer break, they don't think about school, they just think about having fun with friends and doing what they love. If student-designed summer assignments were given, the average grade of each class would most likely be lower than if students were given teacher-designed summer assignments.

The last reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is because the students who designed the summer assignments could get bullied. Bullying in schools is most certainly present. If the students who received the summer assignments found them too hard or too long, they would most likely find whoever designed the assignments and put them down. This will also lower the self esteem of the students who made the assignments. For example, if a group of students found an assignment extremely long and hard, they could find who designed it easily. They then could start to bully the student by calling them names and possibly even physically. If teachers were to design summer assignments, this would be one less reason for someone to start bullying another student.

Teachers are the people who design and teach each course a student could take in school. Because of this it would be most logical for assignments that help a student learn should be teacher-designed. If a student were to be given a teacher-designed assignment their grades would be higher. Teachers should design summer assignments because they know what their student needs to know, students would give themselves easy and short work, and students could get bullied because of long and hard work that other students don't like.",4,Summer projects,Independent
05F76135BBE1,"Have you every been told that adults always have to be around for teenagers to do the right things. Some schools believe that the project they give over the summer should be teacher desgined. I disagree with that for the fact that student desgined projects gives the scholars a chance to show they're responible, show that they have creativity, and show that they are willing follow directions.

My first reason is that teens can show their teachers just how responisble they are just by doing a project over the summer. I might sound like an easy task but its now. Students constantly are distracted by the other lives of their friends and family, therefore a Student might have a hard time complete a task such as this. You might think im pointing out the bad but if the student can overcome this challenge he or she will be on the path of becoming an adult; completing goals that you might not want to do but you have to do it. Student will feel more secure with themselves and more ahead in life. I cannot name a time where being responsible has had a negative outcome.

Next I would like to talk about creativity. The problem with the school system is that they try to limit what a student can do with their creativity. They try keeping it contained so the teenagers will not get out of hand. This choice of action made by the school board, I fell that it is selfish and unjust. In 2008 a movie Created by Disney with the name Lemonade Mouth was released in the movie symbolized that students should stand up for what they believe and get created as Antagonist plotted to take everything out of the school that had irrelaventcy to sports. I believe that students should have this chance to create their own creative ideas to finalize the process of figuring out who they are and who the students would like to become.

Finally I will add that letting students craft projects without supervision will shape them in a way such as following the rules that leads to becoming a productive member of society. Understand what one says and carrying it out without asking question is a tool most adults lack. Teens have an advantage to get this teaching at a young age. Everywhere you journey there are rules that you must follow: park here, throw trash away there, pick up your dog's dropping. We must always follow rules even when we don't want to. Students have the oppurtunity to have a trial and error basis now because once you become an adult there is no more playing around.

So in my closing I strongly agree with the schools letting their young adults achieve early success buy giving them a chance to exercise thier Responsiblity, Creativity, and Direction Following.",4,Summer projects,Independent
80877A1F0A7D,"Some schools should require summer projects. Only because it keeps the students still engaged with the things they have learned over the past year in school. When having a break for so long students tend to forget a lot of things they have learned such as math, history science and English. All subjects are important things that should not be forgotten. When kids are in school they normally get projects that are teacher designed. It would be nice for students to be able to designed things them self.

Being able to make your own project about anything you learned in school would be awesome. If the project was student designed then they should be guide lines. Such as turning in a paper on exactly what your project is about to get it approved by a former teacher. Only to make sure that they are not just doing a project that is about anything, other than school related topics. When having the opportunity to make up your own project, you should have so many new idea on how you wanted to due your past projects. When making a project in the summer you can go big or go home. If It is a science project you could build a huge blasting volcano. That shoots up a big ball of volcanic acid, that flows down and melts things.

When having a project that is designed by a teacher there is certain rules that you have to follow. Such as due dates,certain topics, and strict rules on how exactly the project needs to be done. Teachers give projects that are really harsh. There is most likely always a certain website or paper that is needs to be on. Not everyone wants to do projects the way teachers want them done. So, letting kids adventure out to do their own thing should be nice, as long as there are rules on what they are talking about. If the teachers could have one rule it should be having a project in every subject just to keep the information fresh in to there minds.

Summer is the time for fun, not to keep learning about things or trying to refresh your mind of certain topics that are in school. It is the time to relax and also not have to worry about when things need to be turned in or even the strict rules that teachers make students follow all year long. When in school students have to do so much homework, test and projects. So,having projects for all subjects or just one would be to much on the student. Kids during the school year struggle with these types of things. Students that have so much work in classes probably get really stressed, tired and maybe even depressed. Having a lot of work in school can put so much pressure on a person. So, having the little free time they can during the summer is great. So, what makes the school think that the kids want to still learn during the summer. That is the time to have fun with the family and not worry about school or anything else.

To come to a conclusion, projects should start happening at schools to make kids more involved with their school work and to stay focused. When keeping some of the information you learn, can actually help you remember things that you may need in the next class you are going to. So,when having a summer project there should be guidelines and certain topics. The project should be teacher and student designed. Only because there are thing that need to happen and not happen. So, at the end of the day the project is not inappropriate. ",3,Summer projects,Independent
1F9026998271,"If my principal were to declare that all students were obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity, I would be less than pleased with the idea. I do not believe students should be made to do anything outside of the curriculum by their education system. The mere concept of this rule being enforced shows a lack of understanding or compassion from schools.

Now, please allow me to clarify- I believe that extracurricular activities are perfectly fine. Clubs like ""We the People"" are great for those who are interested in American history or writing, and playing sports is perfect for exercise, to no one's surprise. They are a wonderful way of expanding horizons, making friends and exploring new things. But that's exactly how they should remain:

extracurricular.

As in, outside of the required learning and entirely optional. Students should be free to choose whether they do or don't participate in activities outside of the standard school day. If a student's parents require him or her to do a club or sport, however, that is a very different case. Parents have a say in what their child does, and they have every right to decide if the student will participate in any type of organization. Schools do not and should not have the same level of involvement.

In addition to that, turning extracurricular activities into a mandatory affair is either a waste of student time or class time. Although making clubs compulsory perhaps sounded like a good idea, not only is it a bad one, it's a time-wasting one.

If every single student will do an extra activity, then by that logic, schools would just add an hour to the school day, which I know would not go over well with many. Besides, students already have significant amounts of homework from various classes. Adding another obligatory activity to dedicate time to could very well be too much. Making extracurricular activities mandatory is also just disrespectful to many family's schedules. Maybe a student had already been participating in a separate, unrelated activity or organization. It could be that the student has a religious practice after school, or he or she has to take care of a family member. The examples are endless. Nevertheless, schools should not take up student's time outside of school any more than they already do.

Even if that isn't the case, if the school system somehow managed to squeeze in enough time for an extracurricular activity for everybody without adding any time to the school day, it could potentially be wasteful of the teacher's already limited teaching time. If we only have 45 minutes per class right now, imagine how little it would be adding another period. Educators would be in a constant struggle to cram enough information in such a short class time. If this did happen, it could be very possible that the school year might be stretched out so students could properly learn the concepts, which would leave many students and teachers who love summer vacation with disappointing news.

To summarize, I firmly believe that making extracurricular activities compulsory for students is not a good idea. Those activities are meant to be optional, and if every student were to do them schools would have to monopolize everybody's personal time by extending the school day, drain the little instructional time teachers have by shortening their classes, or elongate the entire school year. While at first it may seem like a terrific idea, various cracks start to reveal themselves at second glance. In the end, I don't think the idea would have worked.    ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DF890FC7D48F,"If every student were to participate is a after school activity or sport, then the school would keep getting better. If the principle were to make this rule then everyone wouldnt be as lazy. When the principle makes this rule happen, no one would be left out of anything, students would get better attitudes and grades, and students would respect the teachers and other students as well.

All students would be apart of something and will make friends eventually, therefore not one student would be sad about being left out which would boost their confidence more and more every day. Everyone gets to pick their sport or activity so that they will have fun doing it but still be working. They wouldnt have to participate in a sport or club that they dont want to but they would have to pick something. Everyone would have at least one friend because they have to work with each other all the time and they would learn to like each other. The whole school would be productive all the time and the schools systems would be improving every day.

The students would be focused on getting good grades because if they dont then they have to leave their club or team and pick a different team or club. Students would like what they do because they chose it and because they like it so much they will have better attitudes and behave better. Students wanna have good grades and be happy and this is the perfect way to make it happen. The more they experience in that club or team the happier the students are gonna be inside and outside of school. Some students are depressed and sad all the time so if we give those students people to hang out with and fun things to do we can wipe out all of the depression that those students have.

If the principle made this a rule than students would have more time to socialize with other students and their teachers. The more socializing that the students have with teachers the more the students will respect the teachers and have a better attitude in their class. If the students know and respect their teacher than they wont act up during class time and the class will be able to get more stuff done. If the students stop messing around in a teachers class than the teachers would respect them and the class could work hard to learn more everyday. The school would get better over time and soon the school will be active all the time.

Everyone would be doing something so that even the kids that dont want to do anything still have to.

C8C708EC29F7,"Why students should participate in extracurricular activities. You should consider doing a extracurricular activity. Because participating in at least one extracurricular activity can help you branch out, make new friends, and you can have access to Currier interests. These are very important because they can help you have a overall better experience at school. Many enjoy doing these activities and find it very relaxing to get away from school for a while and try something new.

Firstly, you can branch out and make new friends, when participating in extracurricular activities. When you are doing something you enjoy, you can find people with the same interests as yourself. Many people like myself love doing extracurricular actives. For example I love doing FFA, I've met so many great people along the way. This organization has taught me so much, such as life lessons, leadership skills, and team building strategies.

Secondly, this is a great way for students to interact with others. In addition they can participate in sports, working on the yearbook, and the debate team. Sports, is a great way for you to get the exercise you need, becoming more social with others, and being competitive with other teams. Working on the yearbook is a great way for students to take pictures, edit on computers, and take part in the making of the the yearbook. Finally the debate team, this club is for students who are very opinionated, strong willed, and are not afraid of public speaking. This club is great for students who enjoy arguing against others and communication well with other teams.

Thirdly, Currier pathways options, this is a bonus to participating in at least one extracurricular activity. You may decide to try something new and really enjoy it. In the future this could possibly be a Currier interest for you. For example if you choose yearbook, a Currier option for you could be photography. There are many options out there, but this one extracurricular activity you choose, could help you make that decision. On the other hand I would think about choosing one of these activities.

In conclusion, you should consider doing at least one extracurricular activity. You can branch out,interact with others, and have access to Currier interests. These activities can really make you more skilled at what you love to do. Therefore I encourage you to do at least one extracurricular activity.              ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
50BC2C5D78A9,"The principal has decided that all students must do an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can be fun or can just give you something to do. However, I do not agree with this. The principal might have a good reason for doing this, but students should be able to do whatever classes they want to do and not do whatever they don't want to do, and some extracurricular activities could clog a busy student's life with unnecessary work.

Students should be able to choose whatever they want to do. Some might want to take extracurricular activities, and some might not want to. One of the most important things about work, school, or any type of job is that it doesn't matter what you're doing as long as you're happy doing it. Happiness has a large effect on anyone's life. It is very important that a student is happy with whatever they are doing, because if they do not like what class they are participating in, they might not want to do their work, which could lead to bad grades, which could lead to anxiety or depression. Then, they might not be able to focus on their other classes, and that means more bad grades. There are many other paths that not enjoying your work can go down, too.

Some children's lives could be very busy. Let's say that a child is living in a family that does not have much money, so they need to stay home and babysit their siblings. An extracurricular activity such as a sport can lead to the child not being home until even later that day, which means their parents have to stay home to watch their other children, meaning the parents can not work to make more money. This could lead to very difficult financial issues for the child's family. In fact, this happens too often in real life. This could happen in real life to a student at the school, and they might not even be able to afford school anymore.

The principal should most definitely consider their decision. Extracurricular activity can affect student's lives in many different ways, but some of effects can be not at all beneficial to a student. Unnecessary work can affect emotional, physical, and mental health in more ways than you can imagine. If students want to do an extracurricular activity, they can, and if they don't want to, they shouldn't have to. Not being able to make your own decision can not only affect what you want, but also what you need.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
C60689EE82FA,"Some people feel that extracurricular activities are not beneficial for children and teens.

I personally think that thet are very beneficial.

These are some reasons why and how they benefit.

You may not know this but 1 in every 3 kids are socially awkward.

Making kids join an after school activity that they enjoy with other kids that enjoy the same thing as them will help them bond with others and make friends.

This will also help with communication skills not only with adults but also with others.

If they dont make mistakes and ask questions about their mistakes than they will never learn.

Sports and extracurricular will also keep kids out of doing bad things.

Most sports are like a gateway of getting away from drugs and drinking underage.

Most sports teams have rules against posting pictures with red solo cups in them to keep the team and players safe.

Colleges look at everything from grades to community service hours.

Colleges also look for leaders at school and in the community.

If colleges see that someone has good grades and is a leader in not only their community but at school as well that will really be beneficial.

It is never too early to start applying and preparing for your future.

As we know our countries obesity rates are going up daily due to new technology like phones and how kids are on their phones way too much and they don't get nearly any exercise.

If kids dont learn how to put down the apple phones and pick up a real apple then before our eyes the country will jut get more and more oboes.

Extra sports will help kids to burn calories and fat in a fun and healthy way.

This is also a good source of exercise without having to go to the gym or having a gym membership.

As we know everyone has their own thoughts and opinions about certain issues and decisions and to conclude I would just like to say please take my essay into consideration when making this decision.

Thank you.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
9579947BE786,"How would you feel if you had to do an extracurricular activity even if you were already busy during the school week? Our principle has decided that it is mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some kids might like the idea of playing a sport or joining yearbook club because they have a lot of free time or they like participating in extracurricular activities. But others might feel like they are already to busy after school with homework taking up their free time or they might want to use their free time to relax and reset themselves for the next day. If students were required to do at least one extracurricular activity then some students would not have time to do homework, students might not be passionate about participating in any of the extracurricular activities offered, and they would not be able to take a break from the stressful school atmosphere.

Extracurricular activities can take up a lot of time which means less time for students to do homework. Sports can be two to four hours long everyday after school making it so students are forced to do their homework late in the night when they really should be in bed asleep preparing their brains for the next day of work. Some extracurricular activities like band require students to participate in concerts which end late at night giving students no time to do their homework at all. Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.

Extracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.

Some students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.

Extracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time. Extracurricular activities should be optional because students need to be able to have time for homework, students may not like any of the extracurricular's offered, and they need to be able to take a break from the school atmosphere.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
99CAD0AF3560,"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons.

To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class

On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they won't play.

Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play.

In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape.

3F8A01E216B1,"How would you feel if your principal said it is mandatory to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? It could be anything like sports, you could work on the year book, or serve on the student council. Some of you may wonder if this would be a good idea or not to make it mandatory to participate in these activity. In my opinion, I think this would not be a great idea to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. In this essay I will give specific details and examples why I think this wouldn't be a good idea.

One of my reasons why I think that making it mandatory to do an activity isn't a good idea is because of different peoples attitude. Some people may have a great reaction to knowing and some others may not even care because maybe they are in an extracurricular activity now. Others could have a negative reaction to it which could be a problem. A reason why this could be a problem is because if they act negatively to this,they could make it hard on the teacher giving them bad attitudes to the teacher make it a whole lot stressful for the teacher if the student doesn't want to be there.

Some people may think that this could be a good thing because it could maybe help students in different ways. Being in a extracurricular activity like Sports could maybe help people be more athletic then they already are. To those who want to be athletic being in something like sports could dramatically help them get what they want to accomplish. Being in a extracurricular activity like maybe some kind of math activity could help different people learn what they want or need to learn. Some people could just like it in general because they can do something they always wanted to and now have the chance to.

Lastly another reason why I think this wouldn't be a good idea is because of maybe cause of the parents. what would they do then if a parent of a child doesn't want there child to participate or don't want them to do a extracurricular activity? Then what would the principal do in these kind of problems? These are all things the principal would have to think about before making a decision to make it mandatory to do an extracurricular activity. Another thing you have to think about is if a student has a disorder or has some kind of sickness mentally or physically then what would the principal do?

These are all valuable reasons and things that play a big part in making a big decision like this. The principal has a lot of things to do/ think about before making a decision like this. I gave reasons why this could be a good thing but, I also gave reasoning on my opinion which is to not make this a mandatory thing. Ultimately I think this wouldn't be a good decision at all and this shouldn't be a mandatory thing.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BB9EF9FA2F9B,"Students should have free time to get away from class for a while but some do not want to get away from class . So it is wrong that the principal is forcing this pressure on students to have to participate in at least one ""extracurricular activity"". Some students enjoy sports or student council and year book staff but some also enjoy spending time in class and paying attention and getting their work done. So you can't force them to participate in other stuff that they might not enjoy . So Why put pressure on them and say that they have to do this or do that ?? And what if there's not good options to pick from then that puts even more pressure on the student . There is no reason we should have to take at least one activity that liberty believes is benefiting the students when really all it's doing is putting stress on the students .

What if the options they have is not what the students are interested in. Because some are in to sports and you have to be good at that sport if you want to make the team. But then lets say the students does not make the team that leaves them with the other stuff they may not want to do, but it's not optional according to the principal we have to take some sort of extracurricular activity but some people arent good enough to do what they really enjoy so dont put un needed pressure on them .",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A60ED461EEC9,"Should students participate in sports, work on year book, or serve on student council. Principal asked all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is it a good or bad decision. I think it is a good decision for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because I can learn something new for participate, meet new people during the extracurricular activity, and have a good time.

First, if I want to learn something new can get in an activity I don't know how to do or play. Instead of wasting my time in something I already know, I can use it wisely to learn new things. Lets say I don't know how to play chest I can learn how to play that instead of playing other stuff I already know how to play. Its like playing a sport I know the rules to it but don't know how to play.

Secondly, most of the people at school I don't even know. Maybe by joining other extracurricular activity I can meet new people. This reminds me when I was in a new school. The only way to meet new people is to go up to them and talk to them. Now I can just play with them and get to know what they like and other stuff. Some people are really loud,smelly,and even play good at soccer like me something I am in to. Some people are like cheats running to the ball. A lot of people are different at my other school,but in this school people are lovely to others and are kindly to me and everyone. That is how I meet new people.

Last, the last thing people should do is have fun. Enjoy while it last because it could only last a week or two. You see having fun is not only with friends it is how you have fun. It has to be something all of my friends like not just what I like. Something we can all enjoy.

Yes, the possibilities are endless when you join an extracurricular activity. But some people think that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time and that they don't really matter in the life.

But I think extracurricular activities contains many benefits to the typical school student. Such as, fitting in better at school,making new friends,and even improving your grades.

When you're in an after school club you'll fit in better by joining the club that best suits you. You can do what you enjoy best while even meeting new students and getting to know them as well. Meeting people that share the same interests as you, will most definitely help you fit in the school. Being the new student in school is scary and stressful. But if you join an after school club then you will definitely fit in better at the school.

Joining an after school club is a great way to be with your friends more and make new friends at the same time. School doesn't have to be the limit when it comes to being with your friends. And when you both join the same club you could spend more time together while doing your favorite things. Such as, being in the same team in a sport or acting in the theater. You and your friend could make new friends and hang out as a group.

If fitting isn't an issue then maybe your grades are. Joining in after school activities could improve your grades on certain subjects that you're struggling on.

Joining in these clubs could significantly improve your grades and help you better understand the subject. And if you do understand the subject then maybe you could help the other students that could still have trouble understanding. Not only would your grades improve but everybody else's that got your help.

In conclusion, I think everybody should join an extracurricular activities since it has many benefits to the average student. Participating in these activities could help you fit in better at school by being part of a group in a school like being in the chess club or football team. Being in these activities could also give you the opportunities to make new friends by meeting new people that share the same interests as you do. Joining these clubs could also give you the chance to bring your grades up and help you pass that test.

10E1C7EDACB8,"Firstly, I disagree because some kids around here may not have the money to do a sport, when you do a sport you have to buy the pants,shoes,the shirt everything that goes with that sport you'll need to buy for the activity or sport. But I do recommend trying to find something to do out of school so your not In your house all day long,but do something that you don't have to pay for, for example help out with a church group or ask people to walk there dogs stuff like that. Anyways i disagree most families out here in the real world don't have much money to spend money on everything your going to need for that activity that your going to do,now if you talk to the school or a teacher an tell them that you really would like to try this sport or this activity maybe they'll help you out with paying for the things but most of the time schools aren't very good with helping you with things like that.

Secondly, some kids may have to watch there brother or sister because there parents have to work or just maybe they only have one mom or just one dad. We never know what might happen if we leave them at their house by themselves. For example one time when I use to live In this big white house when I was younger my mom left to go work so I decide to go to a friends place that wasn't very far from my house so I left them there by themselves,my friend decide to pull up a stop sign but I wasn't involved someone saw her do it an called the cops on us,next thing you know the cops was there then I got in trouble because I've left my brother and sister at home with no one there to watch them. So thats why students should have a choice to not do a sport or a activity, so they don't have to leave their siblings at there house by themselves.

finally, most kids like sports and doing fun activities but I've known some kids and people that don't like to do sports or fun activities. The reason Is I've seen kids get Into big fights over who's going to go first an this an that,thats part of the reason some kids don't get out much to do things but the other reason Is maybe they feel like they'll get judge by what they look like or how they dress trust me i understand that problem. The other thing is sometimes kids have to get a job to help pay bills and get food on the table because there mother Isn't making much money so they have to go get a job and help there mother with stuff they need.

324FCF9DA47C,"Imagine, going to a school where everyone was sad, and there were not any activities to do. It doesn't sound very nice. Well, this is what is going to happen if students do not participate in an extracurricular activity. For example, you could join a sport, work on the yearbook, serve on the student council, and many more. There is something for everyone, so don't be afraid to try new things. Students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved in their school, and is a chance to make new friends.

Studies show that 95% of people that join an after school activity are happier and healthier than those that don't. My brother, Generic_Name, became happier and healthier after joining a sport. Not only did he stay in shape, but his mental health improved tremendously. This all happened because he decided to try out for football. Most people are too afraid to try something new, so they won't. That is why if they are required to join something or try out they might find something that they are really good at. So, next time you are too scared to do something just remember that you won't know until you try.

Next, participating in an extracurricular activity makes for a more involved student body. When, you play a sport or join a club you are showing some school spirit. School spirit makes school fun and enjoyable for both staff and students. When, school is fun you are more likely to join another club or sport, which improves your school spirit more. It is just a big chain reaction and the result is an involved student body. To start the chain reaction you have to make it a requirement to join an extracurricular activity. Yes, the students might be hesitant at first, but they'll love coming to school and participating in things in the end. These things will also improve grades, so the students will be involved and they will improve academically. All of these things make for a more involved student body.

Finally, nine times out of ten people meet their lifelong friends through after school activities. Generic_Name, my sister, participated in several things; including, cheer leading, tennis, FCCLA, production, and track. She met all of her friends through extracurricular activities. Even though, she is almost out of college now, she is still friends with all of them. By putting herself out there she has made friends that she'll keep forever. This also goes back to before, Participating in a sport makes you healthy and happy. Generic_Name became happier, healthier, and involved. Now it is your turn, so will you?

I believe that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, because it makes them happier and healthier, keeps them involved, and is a chance to make new friends. Students may want to play a sport, but they can't because they are not enough people. Or, a classmate wants to try out but they feel as though they aren't good enough. We need to encourage students to participate in something greater than themselves. By making it a requirement to participate in something, they will not be as scared to do it.

Extracurricular activities help you make friends, learn helpful skills in life, discover your passion, and make the school community better. I agree with the principals decision, every student should participate in extracurricular activities. I believe once given a chance, every student will find and love a certain extracurricular activity that speaks to them.

Extracurricular activities are a great way to meet new people, and make friends. When you join an extracurricular activity you meet new people who share the same interest as you. If you're socially awkward or shy extracurricular activities may seem like your worst nightmare. Fortunately, your shared interest will give you something to talk about with your peers that are there, and chances are, you're not the only new person participating. Making new friends can give you someone to talk to, they can make you smile more, and make your day better. Maybe you meet your friends that stay with you for the rest of your life during that activity, if you never try it, you'll never know.

Going to extracurricular activities can also teach you helpful skills in life. There are many different types of extracurricular activities, some you do only for fun, some you do to help your community, and some you do to learn new skills. If you've always thought about trying a certain activity, but you're not sure if you'll like it, extracurricular activities are a great way to go! There are so many different activities that you could try, many of them help you gain skills you'll use later in life. As an example I took Tech Ed, I was wary about it at first, but I had so much fun, and I learned many useful tools in life. I also took Home EC. which taught me how to cook and sew. I learned so much from both classes, and learned many skills from both of them that I will use later in life.

Participating in extracurricular activities can also help you discover your passion. Trying something new can be scary at first, but chances are, you'll find something you like. People discover their passion by trying new things. As your extracurricular activity you may choose to take Tech Ed. You find out that you really like seeing how things are put together, and building things, so you decide to become an engineer or architect when your older. If you never tried Tech Ed you never would have known that you want to become an engineer, and you would have never discovered your love for building things. By participating in new things you have the chance to discover your passion, what you want to do for the rest of your life.

Participating in extracurricular activities not only helps you, but also the school you go to, and your community. Every activity you do helps the school community in someway, so you're not only helping yourself, you're also helping the school community become better. Whether you're picking up trash, tutoring younger students, or you're part of the school basketball team, they all help the school become better. By helping the school, you are ensuring that your legacy lives on, you are ensuring that your school community is the best it can be, for you, for your friends, and for those that come after you.

I agree with the principals decision that every student should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students gain so much from participating in extracurricular activities. They make new friends, learn skills that they will use later in life, discover their passion, and make their community a better place.

When I know that I am doing an activity that I will enjoy, it becomes easier for me to talk to other students and open up a bit. Socializing with people also helps you feel a bit lighter. When there is something that is annoying me I tell a friend or a teacher that I trust and who better than those friends who are doing the same extracurricular activity as you. Your friends are usually doing the same extracurricular activity as you and that helps because you can work and talk with your friends at the same time.

These activities helps the students more then you think. Extracurricular activities helps the person build character. It also gives the students opportunity in life and helps them gain experience, meet new people. That can also get help for homework and school.

Extracurricular activities such as sports helps the student build there character. In sports the student works in a team and listen to the coaches instructions. By letting other people finish their sentences and listening to them. That helps them become a better listener. In sports and in other clubs the student is held accountable for there actions. By knowing the the students actions have consequences and there team depends on them. That helps the student to work hard not to make any excuses. In sports the students have to help their team mates. In a activity if the students team mates needs help on any thing. The student should help them, by helping other people the students builds a strong character.

Students can join new groups and teams and learn new skills, such as cooking cleaning and more. With those experiences it might help them get a job in future. It would look really good on a students job a placation form. If a student wants to become a chef we should have a cooking club. In this club the students learn how to make food and drinks. So when the student wants to become a chef, he already knows the basics before every one else. Also in the group the students can learn how to manage there time under pressure. This is a very important experience that should know. This can help the students on other jobs.

If students are having trouble in school. We should make a group or club where students can get help, from other students on school work, projects and quizzes. With this group the students grades can improve. That might get to know some new test taking skills. Also in this group students are able to talk to new friends and make new friends. Their also able to work on each other weakness and help it become stronger.

Thats why I think we should all participate in at least one extracurricular activities. These groups helps us make new friend, learn new experiences and help us build our character. Some of these groups can also be turned into classes.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
95C7CAC2FB6D,"Ever heard of Bill Nye the Science Guy? If you have, please ""Consider the Following"". School doesn't give many people vibes of achievement, goals, or learning. In fact, school is a pretty stressful time for young people and their peers. I've known students who haven't slept in a week and yet still show up for school. With the chaos that might erupt during the hours of education, adding more would not be ideal. Extracurricular activities can be important and fun for some students, yes, but we have to consider every possible situation that could prevent some students from being able to. Students have their own lives out of the seven hours, and adding more could be something that they are not able to keep up with, that could affect their mental health, or could damage future opportunities.

Students already have work they are given to do after school, and they have responsibilities they have to keep up with when they come home. So homework aside, they could still have a lot to do at home. Parents could be working and they have to tend to their younger siblings. They take shifts at a local Starbucks to earn money so they can help with the bills. Or if they're in America, they could be saving up to pay for college applications. They possibly just come home and relax because they had a big exam and are absolutely drained of any and all energy. Whatever the situation is, after school activities could interfere with their personal and/or outside life. And if the extracurricular is during school or on weekends, that's just more valuable time taken from them that could be used for something else. And that could drain them of energy even more. There could be billions of reasons why they just cannot keep up, and we must take that into consideration.

One of the reasons they might not be able to keep up is because life might be bringing them down. Many students across the globe are so sickeningly stressed, and they aren't even two decades into their life. Adults still have dreams about school and get stressed out about them when they are awake, even if they have graduated years ago. And did you know the average high school student has the same anxiety levels as a 1950's psychiatric patient? While the world has developed from the 1950's, that does not make these facts any less terrifying. And adding more can do something to their mental state of mind. Picture it: a stereotypical basketball player, playing after school 'til six. Suddenly everyone's cheering for them, and the pressure gets to them as they struggle to keep grades up, get good scores on exams, get scholarships, and take care of everything. They become tense and irritable and they don't find time to breathe. Forcing extracurricular activities on top of students while already piling homework and tests and competitions, it is bound to make them break. In fact, forcing even things they like can make them lose their interests. If you force them to do something everyday, they will find that it is probably just for the grade instead of the experience, and they could quickly lose interest in something that they adored before.

All this loss of interest can also play a part in damaging the future. Remember when we talked about saving money for college? If they can't earn enough to apply, that's one missed opportunity right there. They could have been the world's next Einstein and we wouldn't ever know. Or because of working after school on the yearbook committee they miss a party that could have been the best night of their life. A memory that could have stuck with them was erased as soon as they signed up for the student council. We will never know how the future plans out but we have to let the students decide for themselves about that. They need to experience what they choose and when they choose to live it.

So as you can see, everyone lives in their own time and their own place and comfort zone. You can't force things on students forever. If it ever comes to go big or go home, when in student's doubt, just let them decide what works for them. Because these extracurricular activities are not always beneficial to the student.

If you enforce them with knowing everything, it effects their mental being, and can affect their lives outside of school and their future as well.                          ",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1DC6485ABFF6,"Do you participate in any after school activities? Well if you don't now you have to, my principal if making it mandatory to participate in at least one after school activity. You can participate in many activities such as sports teams, student council, and the debate team. There are many points for why this shouldn't be a rule in school. Some points are time management, interest, and funds/workers.

My first point is about time management, if students are doing extra activities they might not have time to do other important things. One of these important things is homework, if there doing activities they don't have time to do the homework a teacher assigned. This would lead the student to be behind in there classwork and cause there grade to drop. The second important thing they wouldn't have time to do is there chores. A lot of kid have chores and if there not done there parents will not be happy. This leading to the kid getting in trouble and getting a punishment.

My second point is interest, if there is no activities that interest the student there not going to have fun. And if they are not having fun they will slack off and not try there best. If a student doesn't want to do a activity that may cause them to make there own fun and act out and get into trouble. Then there parents would be angry and they would get in more trouble and the teachers would be angry because if the kid got Saturday school the teacher have to come watch them. Plus if they get in trouble that will mess with there record.

My third point is funds and workers, if you have more activities you need more money and more people to work them. And the school would have to ask the county for more money and the county might not have that amount of fund for the school. And you have to find the people to work those activities witch may be hard to do. And the schools may not be big enough for the activities to all be housed there. And that means they might have to rent a space for a activity to be held and that cost more money.

That is my three points on why I thing it would not be a good idea to make it mandatory for every student to participate in a after school activity. I already participate in a after school activity but I hope it is never mandatory. It would not achieve what school want witch is to keep kids active. It would only make the problem get worse and wouldn't fix it at all. The three points are funds/workers, interest, and time management. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
6E050DCAB4E6,"In the Declaration of Independance, it is written that all men have certain rights, including the rights to ""life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness.""

If students were forced to participate in an extracurricular activity, two of those three rights would be taken away, at least for an afternoon or so.

Over the next three paragraphs, I will list the negatives of forcing students to do extracurricular activities, including that it takes away students freedom, they might not want to do it, and it could take away valuable time.

My first point is that it takes away freedom of the students.

People should be able to choose whether they want to do something.

If someone wanted to play soccer, but then the school was like ""NO! You have to be on the student council instead!"", then the school would be taking away their freedom to choose.

They also might not have enough time to do it.

If they already have a full schedule, then what?

Does the school force them to take something out?

And how do they enforce it?

If someone doesn't want to do an extracurricular activity, and realizes that forcing kids to do it is stupid, then how will the school make them?

They can't punish them.

It doesn't add up.

Students should be able to decide whether they do something like this or not, because America is built on freedom, and schools can't take that away.

Furthermore, the students might not want to do it.

If they wanted to play a sport, there is only limited slots on a team.

If they fail to make the team, then what?

Are they just told to pick another activity?

And also, the school might not offer what a student wants.

If a student loved anime and wanted a club, but there wasn't one, then don't force them to do something they don't want to do.

If they do force kids to do it, they should at least ask them what they would like to do, and if they don't have that, then create it.

And if they do force them to do something they don't like, someone could add a bad review on google.

Then, parents might decide they don't want their kids going to school there.

And if enough kids transfer, then the school might get shut down because they have no purpose to keep running.

Finally, it takes away valuable time.

Like I said in the first body paragraph, if they don't have enough time to do it, then what will the school do?

They can't force them to free up time, so the system is quite flawed.

Also, if a student has a pretty full schedule, and only has 1 free day, the school might take that away.

A couple of days in the week is fine to have things to do, but if you have something every single day, and only one day in a week that you are free, that is a valuable day.

Students need some days to unwind.

Plus, what if you had a lot of homework?

A conversation might go down like this:

The teacher said ""Hey Richard, did you do your essay?

I didn't ever get it from you.""

And then Richard said ""No, I'm sorry, but I wasn't able to finish it.

Since the principal is making us do these extracurricular activities, I had to do a club, and I wasn't able to study for my massive quarter test in algebra and do my essay last night.

I will try to get it to you today.""

That would be horrible for students, and could result in lower grades.

Students should not be forced to do extracurricular activities.

It takes away freedom from them, they may not want to do it, and it could take away valuable time, too.

I think that every person should be given a choice in what they do, and school or parents or whomever should not be allowed to choose for them.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
99A1DE3CF37F,"Students are going home everyday having nothing to do, therefore some of them turn to hang out with the wrong crowd, with the wrong people. Some turn to drugs, while others turn to alcohol. If only they had something to do after school, then they wouldn't do things like drugs and alcohol. That is why every student must participate in an extracurricular activity. While every student should do an extracurricular activity, the school has to provide multiple after school activities so that students have options to pick from. All students should participate in extracurricular activities because it gives students the feel of school pride when their school goes into a competition, it takes up time in a students day so they don't have to go do drugs and alcohol, and it surrounds a students with a good environment.

When students are involved in school, they participate in more school events like football games, school parties, and theater productions. Not only are the students more involved, but their friends are too. Most kids don't like to go to school events by themselves, so they bring a friend. If every student brings at least one friend, then the amount of people that goes to the events doubles. Just last year I was on my middle school basketball team and we were playing a team that we were rivals with. I wanted my friends to see and watch me play, so I brought at least twenty people to the game. When people are involved in something, they want their friends to see what they have done, and they want to be praised. The students may not enjoy being forced to stay after school at first, but they will soon learn to love it.

Some students go home to an empty house, for their parents come home late at night because they are working. With nothing to do they start to watch shows and movies, but they get bored and tired of watching TV shows after a while. When somebody is bored, they look for anything to cure their boredom. Some turn to friends, while others turn to drugs and alcohol. If they drink enough, they get drunk and do things without knowing they did it. This kills time a lot faster than sitting around doing nothing all day. Drugs can be worse because the consequences can be a lot more serious. Some consequences are liver failure and death. Both are also very expensive and addictive, so it makes the people taking it want to take one more dose, drink one more cup, until they no longer have any money because they spent it all on drugs and alcohol. Their school could have prevented all of this if the student just stayed after school for a little longer. If the students stayed after school for the yearbook committee, they would not have the time to be bored because they would be too busy creating a yearbook for the whole school to see. When students stay after school for extracurricular activities they do not need to turn to drugs because they are busy at school. The school also fills the students with a good environment, which leads me to my next topic.

A child acts and does things similar to the people they hang out with. If their friends are people that do a lot of community services and are nice people, the child will turn out to be nice too. This does not just apply to children, but it applies to everybody. Sometimes a good environment can be hard to find, but what better place sets a good environment than a school. A school has teachers that are willing to support their students and give them good guidance. Whenever I have a question with friends or anything, I have this one teacher that I know I can trust. This teacher helps and guides me with whatever my problem is. Everybody can find that one teacher they can trust if they joined an extracurricular activity. They could bond and connect with the teacher that is helping out at the activity, and they could find a good influence similar to the one I have.

Participating in an extracurricular activity helps and benefits students in many ways, and when students are ever looking for something to do, they don't have to turn to drugs, they could turn to after school activities which gives them a good and positive learning environment and it gives students the urge to participate and attend school games and parties. School may not be a students favorite place to be, but it provides students with a safe place that can have fun activities like soccer club or basketball club. Some students might complain about the new policy, but once they change their mindset, they will learn to love and enjoy the new rule. Not only are they staying in a safe environment, they are also hanging out with their friends outside of school hours. This time would also be a great time for students with no friends to take a chance and try to make some. Since extracurricular activities are fun and it provides a good and safe environment, making it mandatory it something I agree with and I think is right.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
5AEDB0F22B98,"I disagree with the principle on this decision, to make every student do an extracurricular activity because of three main points, the first being a student may have an activity that doesn't count as an extracurricular activity and adding the extracurricular activity would interfere with their schedules, the second point is students have lots of homework already. It may already be hard to keep up with school work for some students, and adding more work for them to do may make their grade drop and may add more stress to their lives. The third and finial point I'm going to make is, if you force students into extracurricular activities that they may not enjoy doing the amount effort they would put in will be low.

To elaborate on my first point, lets imagine you are a student and you had to go to school, then head to a job for a few hours then back to your house where you have to make dinner for you're whole family. After dinner you start your homework, every weekday that is your schedule. Then the principle make you start a extracurricular activity which mess up your whole schedule adding more stress and more things you need to do into your life.

Adding to my second point, If a student is already struggling in school and already has lots of stress to deal with. Then making the student add an extra curricular activity may not be the best course of action because it will only add extra stress to their lives. This may make their grades drop which will only add more stress to their already extremely stressful lives.

The final point is, if we force students to get an extracurricular activities that they didn't want to do. They would get bored of those extracurricular activities, and since we are forcing them to do those activities they will just lower the amount of effort they put into those activities, and making the school look like it bad because the students would have poor work.

Instead of forcing students into extracurricular activities, a better solution would be to encourage students to join in on some extracurricular activities. Then let them choose if they want to join any extracurricular activities on their own, because if we force all students to do extracurricular activities no matter what no one will benefit. I believe that if we let them choose if they want to join in extracurricular actives. They will be more inspired and will produce better work overall.

In collusion, I disagree with the principle on his decision, and believe that we should encourage students to join not just to forcing them into a extracurricular activity, because students will we more inspired to do the work and produce better work if they got to choose, than if they didn't get to choose.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

They could make new friends or be with there friends, by group activiyes.

A plus is that students will get off there phones and find somthing they would like to do. Another reason is the partents wont have to forces or make them do something they don't want to do in order to get them out.

DE728DF42B4C,"Principals are like the alphas in a school. Everything the principal says, you have to do. My principal decided for every student at the school to be in a activity, or in other words, a club. I agree with this offer because it can give kids opportunities, help them try something new, and be able to fit in a group or student body.

Doing fun things is awesome right? i dont know anybody who likes to stay home and do nothing all day. There are many opportunities out in the world but the principal is trying to bring in even more. Things that you like to do can be in a activity the school has. The activities can probably have big offers. For example, an art club. An Art Club is very artistic. The club draws, paints, and learns different things you've never known about art. The teacher says, one day, that there will be a competition for the best drawing. The competition can help you get better and learn new things. What artist doesn't want to have that big opertunitie? Not only does art have opportunities but other activities do too. For example the student council. the student council helps with fun raising and school activities. If you ever wanted to be in charge of something, you could sign up! that could be a great opertunitie for you.

Learning and trying things is cool right? Sometimes, you can get tired of what you like and what your doing, so you move on to the thing you were into before, to another. Trying new things can help you learn how to do things you havn't even tried. For example, in the movie ""High School Musical"", a boy named Generic_Name loves basketball. He is the team captain and everyone knows who he is. Everyday he practices and gets tired of shooting the same ball into a the same hoop. He goes to school the next day and see's a play is having try outs. Though he has never sang before, He wants to try and see if hes good at it. Doing different things that you normally do is perfectly fine. Not everyone likes the same thing all the time. Learning new things can get you to try even more new things. I've tried it before as well. For example, a girl named Generic_Name is a dancer and wants to take a break from it. Her feet hurt and she thinks she can pull of something else. Her school has many activities and she tries out for the soccer team. Never be afraid to do knew things.

Not everyone is in a certain group or activity. there are students in the world who think they dont fit in and have low self esteem. This offer from the principal can help you fit in a group. These activities can help you make new friends. Making new friends is amazing and you can be proud to say your in a group and have many friends. For example, A girl named Generic_Name is quiet at school. She always has her head down when she walks in the hallways. she never smiles nor talks. one day, the principal gives an announcement about every student being in at least one activity or club. She first say she doesn't want to do it, but tries anyways. In the club she picked, she meets new people and feels happy to be apart of something. this offer can bring you smiles to your faces everyday, Though these activities might not be everyday, you can say proudly and loudly, that you feel like you fit in. Another example is that a boy named Generic_Name has multiple friends. one day his friends leave him and he feels alone. He doesnt think he fits in. he feels like he doesnt want to go to school anymore. when he goes to school, he sees all of the activities that are on a big board. he signs up for a musical and meets new friends. fitting in is a good thing. These activities can help you with so much

Principals are helping everywhere around the world. they try there best to make learning fun and create new things like clubs and activities. the principal says every student needs to be in at least one club or activity. though some students dont agree, I do. What the principal is offering is valuable because it can give kids new opportunities in what they like and they can do things they have never done before. It can also help you fit in to a place that you think you wont be able too. every principal is very hard working and i think with this offer, it will bring students together and smiles on all of the students faces.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
0FD27A7C4257,"If the principal of my school decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would be happy. I would be happy because there are many benefits to doing an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can make you better at different things and they are often fun. They also give you a break from the regular school day to do something you enjoy. I totally agree with my principal's decision.

If you chose to do a sport it would be good for your body. You would get your daily exercise in while doing something fun. Doing a sport would also make you a better communaciater. If you do a sport you have to work with your team. They have to understand what you need and you have to understand what they need. To do that you have to talk to each other.

There are many extracurricular activities to choose from. If you don't yet know what you enjoy, this would be a perfect opportunity to explore new activities. You could try new things and see what you like. This would also make it easier to choose a future career. If you know what you enjoy then you can narrow down your job choices.

Extracurricular activities give kids a break from the regular school day to do something they enjoy. This hour of ""fun time"" might give some kids a reason to like school. You would look forward to this class because you enjoy it.

These activities can also build relationships. You could make new friends in your extracurricular class because you all like the same thing.

In conclusion I think it is a great idea to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities expand your horizons and make you better at the things you like. They are fun and encourage students to try new things. You can explore the plethora of activities and find one you like.

0FE3B7AAD133,"There are millions of schools across America. Many schools offer extracurricular activities after, before, and during school. I believe that extracurricular activities are a great way to become more social and outgoing within your community, but I don't think it should be forced upon either. Yes, you may have those kids who would love to socialize more, but you also need to look at the bigger picture. Millions of children get bullied everyday for anything, clothes, appearance, religion, etc. I have come to terms with the fact that you can't change people, but you can prevent unspeakable situations from happening. I disagree with forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities because they may get over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time.

From a students perspective, another extracurricular activity may be enjoying, others may not agree. As stated, three of these possible activities are student council, sports, and working on the yearbook. The possibility of getting over worked is very high. If a child thought they could be on the student council, but realized it was to much for them, what would happen? Could they just leave the council or would they have to go through with it? What if they didn't say anything at all because they we're too embarrassed? Children already have to go with so much already believe it or not. Kids already have homework, projects, tests, etc. Then to add another chip on their shoulder, kids could become very stressed with their activity.

Bullying has been very big problem these past couple of years. Lots of it has to do with social media. Still, many kids get bullied in school. Based on how they look, how they dress, what they bring to eat, religion, and more. That could happen so much easier when you add another extracurricular activity. For example, lets say a student chose to do sports, and this student wears a hijab as part of her religion. Everyday she's told to take it off or is called slurs by other classmates in her activity class that she has never met before. It's the same people every day, she just shrugs it off. She then finally says something to a teacher. They finally get suspended for how many days, and are kicked out of the sport class. Everything is fine now, right? Wrong, she will always remember what they said to her, and it could've been prevented if they didn't force an extra class.

Many kids have their own out of school activities. A child may get caught up in both of their activities. For example, lets say that a student has to go to school for their activity, but they also have soccer practice. If they go to practice then they miss the in school activity, and if they go to school then they miss their practice. Both are very important to the student, but they need to choose. They shouldn't have to choose, and then be stressed about the other decision.

Adding another extracurricular activity may make a student over worked, have a higher chance of bullying, and lose personal time. I think that if you want to do an extracurricular activity you can, and if you don't want to you dont have to. If you did do another activity what would the end goal be for that. Would it be to make kids social? Would it make kids try and trust each other? Maybe, forcing children to communicate with one another isn't the best choice?              ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Participating in extracurricular activities at school is very enjoyable and gives people something to do. There is a wide variety of activities that are available to participate in at school like playing sports, working on the yearbook, and being apart of the student council. Although many choices are available, that does not mean everyone is required to be apart of a club or organization at school. It should not be mandatory to do school activities because people may do other activities outside of school, not be interested in taking part in school activities, or have no time and money to be apart of a school group. An important part of being a student and a teenager is making their own decisions by picking what they like and don't like. Middle School and High School students are more independent and responsible, so they make their own choices on what activities to partake in.

Firstly, a majority of students participate in other activities outside of school. Sports are the most common things for students to do in their free time. Playing school sports should not be mandatory because students who play travel sports or any type of sport outside of school already have to deal with complicated schedules and practice times. It's not just sports that take up so much time though; students have to do homework, study, make time to hang out with friends, and have hobbies that they find fun and relaxing. If students do activities outside of school like playing sports or writing stories, they might not care to play sports or be in a writing club for the school because they already do those things outside of school on their own time.

Secondly, some students do not want to do any activities. Not everyone has to do something if they don't want to, because participating in educational activities at school is something that should be optional and not required for all students. Playing sports, working on the yearbook, or being apart of a student council does not appeal to every single student at a High School or Middle School. Even if a student is interested in art and painting, that particular individual does not have to be in an Art Club at school unless they choose to be. It is always good to have an average amount of members in each club so all clubs are equal and can represent the school by the activities they take part in. But, by creating a rule that students have to be in at least one club, students may join random clubs just to abide by the rules, even though they show no particular passion or liking of their club of choice. When this happens, nobody will actually care for the activity they chose because they would've been forced to be apart of it, which takes away the fun.

Lastly,

Students may not have enough time or money to be involved in school sports, yearbook club, or a student council. Activities like sports or organized clubs can have practices, games, or meetings daily. More Specifically, sports gear costs a large amount of money and needs to be replaced once in a while. Transportation could also be an issue for getting to and from the school or places that students hold games or meetings. If a student tries to balance a school activity, something outside of school, and homework, they could become stressed and not perform as well in those three activities. Overall, the decision of whether or not a student participates in extracurricular activities should be decided by each individual student themselves, because everyone is different and knows how many activities they can handle at a time.

In conclusion, I disagree with the principals' decision to force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity on school grounds. The principal should just highly encourage students to participate in things like sports, clubs, and organizations instead of creating a rule about them. A lot of different kinds of people go to school,and not everybody shares a common interest. Whether it be Middle School or High School, there is not going to be a club or extra curricular activity for everyone to be themselves and thrive with their peers. It should not be mandatory for students to be apart of extracurricular activities at school because of students having hobbies outside of school, not be interested in doing these activities, or they have don't have time and money to join a school group. So, instead of forcing all students at school to be involved, create more options for all different types of people to join. This whole problem can be solved by posting fliers or making announcements about upcoming events or new clubs. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Do you think every body should do a extra curricular activity? Most people do activities but the school does not run them. A lot of schools dont even host good our a lot of programs. Most activities do not fit every body. After school things separate more time away from peoples family.

If someone makes the team for a sport over a kid who wants it more then that person. The student that made it gets forced to do something he docent want to do, and ruins opportunities for other kids. Students should not have to do a extra activity kid who want's it, freedom, and passionate.

Kids who really want's something might not be able to achieve there goal. They put in extra work and grinding for along time. Some kids might just be there to say they are on a team or program. If every one had to do one extra activity things would get packed. They have been trying there best for a lot of years and just join something for free.

People love to have freedom they like to go home play with there dog our younger siblings. next there some kids that like play video games and make money from that. Forcing kids do an activity might make sad if they get joked cause they do something wrong. Not every body parents or guardians can come pick the up after school. Theres a lot of kids out there like to do activities by them selves because it helps them focus.

Finally kids are passionate about there own activities. Having to do another activity can make some students irritated. Students are already at school for seven plus hours. Kids should follow there dreams stick to it and make new things happen.

Students would like to pro sue there own path.

At last this is why having extracurricular activities is not he brightest idea. Hope that this will put an idea principle thought. Having to do extra activity when just make the day if longer.

The first reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students have a job after school. I have a friend that is trying to get a job and he would probably work everyday after school. When he gets home after school he world only have a few hours to get his homework done and get ready for work, since he would probably go straight to sleep when he got home after work and not have time to do his homework. If he also had an after school activity then he would have even less time to do his homework and get ready for his job. He would also be even more tired when he got home because he didn't have the few hours he would normally have to get some rest before he had to get ready.

The second reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some students may have to help their families after school. Some students when they get home after school don't have a parent home to take care of their siblings so they would have to do it. They have to make food and make sure their siblings do what they are suppose to do be doing. If they had to have an extracurricular activity then they would get home later than their siblings. Their siblings would have time to do whatever they wanted before anyone got home. Then when they got home they would have to get their sibling back to what they are suppose to be doing. After that they would have to make food, clean up whatever their siblings were doing, do their homework, and any other work they may have to do.

The final reason I think this is a terrible idea is because some people would have to do multiple activities. If someone was already doing one activity but it wasn't created as a part of the school you go to then you would probably have to start a second activity and try to balance the two activities, schoolwork, homework and anything else that they have to do after school. If they are not able to balance everything then they would have to stop doing one of the activities, and it would probably have to be the activity that is not a part of the school. Also some students may be doing a sport and sports are only for part of the year so they would have to do multiple and the start and end dated for the sports may overlap. So they would be doing two and may miss practice or a game for one of them.

In conclusion I think that schools having a mandatory after school extracurricular activity is a terrible idea because some students may have jobs after school, some may have to help their family, and some would have to multiple activities. Some students would have to balance schoolwork, homework, the two activities, a job, families, and anything else they may have to do after school. All of that may be too much for some students and they could fall behind in their classes.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

English Honors 8 3.11.2020

Dear Principal,

I have heard that there is a new rule being put into place making it so that everyone is required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, clubs or sports or a musical instrument, etc, but what happens if students cannot make it to the activity? What will happen when there are things or important issues that come up causing them to miss the extracurricular? I disagree with putting this rule into action because there are many reasons it isn't helping all students and here are some of my thoughts on why I think it shouldn't be a rule.

Some of the students families in school might be struggling with financial issues or aren't as financially inclined at the time being and might have a hard time keeping up. Making parents spend the money to pay for the extracurricular activity rather than paying for more important stuff isn't something we should be promoting or making a requirement.

Parents work. You work. Teachers work. Most adults work. With that being said, some parents can't take off work to take their children to the sport or club that they participate in because they don't have time and their work is important to help support the family. Along with parents not having time, students and kids can struggle with time and not being able to make it to the extracurricular. Homework and schoolwork can be a big deal to us. It affects the grade point average and then colleges and then your career as an adult. Although, that might seem far fetched but that's how others think and that's how some plan. Students might need tutoring and help and having to participate in an activity can take away that time.

I do sports and play instruments. I always have, but it's been a choice for me to participate in each of them. I once did four, but that was too much for me so I stopped one. Having the option to stop or not do an activity is something every one of us needs. People like doing new things and trying them out but to others it frightens them. Thats how it is with requiring the participation in an extracurricular activity. Some like doing things and getting out and trying different things but others find it a struggle and unnecessary to do. While I see that you are trying to help and think that this is the right option and should be something necessary I think that other families can find it is a hassle and that making kids participate in extracurricular shouldn't be required but more encouraged as a choice that is fun and new. I hope you take this into consideration.

Best,

F6DA09C9C0C1,"Did you know that 6 out of 10 kids do extracurricular activities? I agree that the principal should make everybody do at least one extracurricular activity. There are so many different things to choose from as your extracurricular activity. You could do a sport or you could even join a club. I agree with the principal because you could make new friends, you can join a club, you can join a sports team and it can help you to stay healthy and fit.

Schools offer many different sports that you can play. You can do boys or girls basketball, softball, boys or girls track and field, volleyball, wrestling, and field hockey. If you decide that you want to do a sport there are so many positive things to get out of it. It can help you to stay healthy and fit, you could loose weight and gain healthy eating habits. Also it can encourage you to step out of the box more and do new things and take more opritunities. School sports teams are a lot of fun and maybe if you like it a lot you can join a sports team outside of school.

Even if sports arent your thing then you could join a club. Schools have lots of clubs including, chess, reading club, homework club, NJHS, video game club and, the green team. There are lots of clubs at schools to join and if you decide to join a club that you've never done before or that you've never even heard of you may end up liking it. Joining clubs can inspire you to venture out and maybe even continue on with that club outside of school. Maybe you're so interested in it that you want to start your own club.

Extracurricular activities can help you make new friends. 4 out of 10 friends start in extracurricular activities. Lots of people who meet while doing a sport or a club end up staying friends for life. School is an amazing place to make new friends. You will never know or experience such great things unless you try. Having a friend that enjoys the same things that you enjoy is good too because you guys can relate on many things. While you go to practice you will always have a partner and you guys can even practice together outside of school.

I completely agree with the principals decision. Going to school may be your least favorite thing to do but if you have something to look forward to then school may become your new favorite place. School is a great place to venture out and try new things. Extracurricular activities include sports and clubs and they are a great idea and something that everyone needs to do. The principal has a good point of view because there are so many things to choose from, you could play a sport, join a club and, make new friends.         ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
58211510AB4F,"Some students don't think that doing extracurricular things like sports, yearbook, or be on student council are fun or even interesting. Students shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. It should be their choice to do something that they like, instead of the principal's choice.

Students have so much homework now, that they do not have time to do extracurricular things. To some kids school is more important than sports and other things. They want to focus on their future as an adult, so they want to prioritize school and not the other things. Doing good in school gets you a good job. A good job, gets you good money.

Some parents can't afford to buy the thing that the kids need to do the extracurricular activity. What if a student wants to do a sport, but they can't because their parent can't afford to buy the gear that they need. Gear is very important, so when you play a sport that you want to play, you can play safely. What if the kid is doing an art class and they need paint brushes and crayons, but they can't afford to buy it. Plus they don't even want to take that class, they are only taking the class because their principal is forcing them too.

Student might not be interested in the extracurricular activities that the school offers. Why should kids be forced to do something that they don't want to do? It's wrong for someone to do that to a child. Kids are tired enough from waking up really early and then having to do something else in the day. Maybe they aren't committed to doing something because they aren't interested in it. What you do in school is depending on your career, why would you do something are you aren't interested or committed too?

These students shouldn't be forced to do something that they don't want too do. Either they are too busy, they can't afford to buy what is required to have in that class, or if they aren't interested in it. Students should be able to choose what they want too do, not the principle. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A917258AD9D9,"Have your parents ever forced you to go out and do something because they say you're wasting your life away? If so then you probably also know that it is not fun or enjoyable at all when you're made to do it. So when you are obligated to join a club and or do an extracurricular activity it won't be something most people are exited to do because some people just might not have enough time on their hands, they may have no interest in the activities available, and when something like that is forced upon them they may lose interest in something that they would have loved or even pursued in the future.

First off the school doesn't know what every student does after school, and if they did that would be weird, so why should they make after school activities a requirement. A good majority of the students have things they do after school whether it be practice for city league sports, looking after their parents shop, and even the copious amounts of homework they may have been assigned. Some students just don't have the spare time to do these after school activities and making it required would just add onto the stress and imbalance of their schedule.

Another problem could be that the students have no interest in the options given to them or they offer no value to what the student wants to pursue in life. Because when five out of the seven options available are sports and you don't like sports or you want to do something that isn't related to sports like engineering then you got a problem. You wont get the skills you need for what you want to do and well your not interested.

Lastly it could cause them to lose interest in something that they otherwise would have loved to do. For example imagine that soccer is your favorite sport and you enjoy playing it a lot but it's not the only thing you enjoy, but because you like it, it gets shoved down your throat every day and your being forced to do it competitively so it went from something you enjoyed and did every so often to something you hate and never want to do again all because it was forced upon you.

In conclusion I don't think that schools should require after school activities because some students may not have the time to do them, they might not have an interest in whats offered, and they could get tired or bored with something they enjoy all because it was forced. Also if an after school activity is required from every student then it's not really after school anymore it just becomes an extension of school time.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

E3098475BFE3,"The Benefits of Extracurricular Activities by Generic_Name

Some people think that extracurricular activities are a waste of time and energy. However, in my eyes, that couldn't be any further from the truth. There are plenty of extracurricular activities out there to try. You could join a sports team, try out for the school play, work in the yearbook committee, or join the student council. All of these activities have plenty of benefits: you can meet new people, learn something new, and you can have some fun.

The first benefit I found of extracurricular activities is that they can help you meet new people. If you join an extracurricular activity it's extremely likely you'll meet at least one new person there. Plus, if they joined the same activity as you, you two at least have that one thing in common. That one thing in common can lead to more things in common which could lead to a great friendship. Friends are always great to have and extracurricular activities are excellent ways to make friends.

The second benefit I found of extracurricular activities is that you can learn something new. The extracurricular activity you join is most likely going to be something you like to do, so by participating in this activity you can learn how to do that something or do that something even better. If you become more skilled at something you can do it more easily and more often. If it's something you like you won't get bored of doing it over and over again as easily as with something you don't like. Also, it's great to be able to brag to your friends about learning a new skill.

The third and final benefit I found of extracurricular activities is that they're just something fun to do. The extracurricular activity you do is most likely going to be related to something you like, so you'll be able to have fun doing it. You can also get better at this thing you like which is always a nice bonus. Additionally, it gives you something fun to do if you're bored after school and have nothing else going on. It's hard to complain about an activity when it involves something you like.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities have plenty of good benefits. They can help you meet possible new friends, they can help you learn something new, and they can give you something fun to do. Now that you know the benefits I found on extracurricular activities, why not join one or two? You might end up having a good time with it. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BFEDA9FE9F1E,"What have a choice of being a sport, working on a yearbook, or serving in the student council? That's correct! An extracurricular activity! Activities are things you can do on the side for fun, and they help keep you active almost everyday. However, do you think that the principal should make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity? Saying that, in addition to the principal's decision, I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because an activity helps with communication, it helps students keep their minds off of the bad behaviors that they have, and parents' would not have to stress about their child.

First, an activity could help with communication. students would be able to socialize with their peers around them, in particular, they would be able to discuss and share things with each other. Also, students would take turns on sharing their thoughts and plans with their peers. Students would also learn how to work together. They would have fun activities that requires teamwork to accomplish it. Not to include that Students would have to get along with each other or else there would be consequences.

Next, It helps students keep their minds off of the bad behaviors that they have. The activities would help the students to not focus on being in the streets. The reason for that is that students would be occupied with the activity that they're in. Also, they would not be a part of any violence because of their activity. Students won't be able to go out with gang members because they're too busy after school. The same goes for fighting and any other type of violence as well.

Finally, parents' would not stress about their child. One of the reasons that parents' would not stress is because the extracurricular activities that are provided would be held after school. In that case, parents' would not have to worry about leaving work early to pick their child up. Also, there would be food provided for students. Students would have school dinner after their activity. In addition of saying that, parents' wouldn't have to worry about their child being overly hungry after school.

Some people might disagree with this decision. They might say '' I have other things to do,"" or, "" I don't like any of the activities provided!"" However, what they don't think about is how extracurricular activities can affect them positively!

In conclusion, The principal's decision is something that can have a positive effect on everyone. Therefore, I agree with the principal because it can help students socialize, students would not think about negative things in the outside world, and parents' would be stress free. As a fact, everyone should be in an extracurricular activity. Don't you think so?",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A18AABF41A28,"Why Should students participate in extracurricular activities? This is a question a lot of students ask and today I'm going to help you learn why extracurricular activities are important. Extracurricular activities are really important and they will help you a lot. Students should participate in extracurricular activities because of Students get to exercise, learn new things, and also meet new people.

Students get to exercise. Play a sports makes you exercise. when someone plays sports they have to exercise a lot and eat better so they can have a better performance. They can get stronger. When you play for a sport they will make you lift heavy things so you can get stronger. have a better life. You will feel way more relax and healty after you start to play a sport. Because of this things I thing students should participate in extracurricular activities.

You get to learn new things. you could do an activity that you don't know. You can participate in a new activity to know if you are going to like it. Find an activity that you will like to do. If you do something you like to do you are going to be way better at it. Your knowledge can get bigger. If you learn new things you are going to have more knowledge. Because of all this things I think students should do extracurricular activities so they can get to learn new things.

I know that sometimes students don't like to participate in extracurricular activities. I know sometimes It's hard. However, try someting you think you are going to like. you can meet new people. you are going to be making new friends that are going to do the same activity that you are doing. This is why I think students have to participate in extracurricuar activities.

It is good for students to participate in a extracurricular activity it helps them learn new things. Students should do an extracurricular activity because of They could get fit, practice new things and make new friends. Becase of all this things I agree the students have to participate in extracurricular activities.      ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A14D91BB2BE2,"Do you believe that schools should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity? In my personal opinion, I think that they shouldnt have to be involved for several reasons. First of all, they already have homework and school assignments that need to be completed. Secondly, some may want to use their extra free time to be involved with friends and work on their socializing skills. Lastly, some students may not have the time nor money to be able to participate in the additional activities.

My first reason to support my claim is that students have homework or class assignment that need to be completed by certain due dates. However, most activities can interfere with getting the assignment in on time. Students need the time for home work so that it doesnt decrease grade even if its a minor change. Additionally, they also need the time to study for up coming test that could affect their GPA or grade majorly. Along with that, 78% of students from middle and high schools have claimed that activities involving with their school work has added on even more stress witch has also caused a lack of sleep. Teacher could build onto that stress by pointing out their bad grades or missing assignments.

To add on to that, students ,preferably teens and preteens, need the extra time away from school to socialize with their friends or peers. If a student is involved with an activity, they may refuse to be with that friend so they can participate witch may cause their friends to quit inviting them places. Scientist have proven that being with a peer that they may enjoy being with; can take their mind away the stress from school or at home. Therefore, if a student isnt getting any socializing time, then that could affect their mental health and could cause the student to be depressed, or inherit anxiety from stressing so much. In 2018, 66% of students stated that being involved with extra activities and schools at once caused them to get depression and that affected their effort in school overall.

Furthermore, some students might not have the time nor money to be able to participate. Many students on social media, have made complaints about how practices or meeting have interfered with family gatherings. Mainly when around Christmas, Thanksgiving, or birthdays. Students also need the time to be with friends and be involved with upcoming events. To add on to this reason, some families may not have enough money for their children to participate in these events. Many activities require the students to own equipment, gear, or special clothing so that they could be involved. The average price for most sports equipment averages from 40$ to 80$ depending on the brand and quality.

You see, Kobe Bryant and other athletes have said that to be involved in sports or any extra activities, you must have the free time to do that. However, students dont have the extra time for that when they already have school work that needs to be done, friends to socialize with, and if they dont have to money for it. Students should be able to control what they can do in their extra free time. Hopefully I have persuaded you to agree with my position in this.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
7F1808A53482,"Bright lights, keyboards clicking, cold and uncomfortable seats. Sometimes we just need to take a break from non-stop working in school. I believe that all student should participate in one extracurricular activity, whether its a sport or an after school club, its good to have some free time.

Its important to get out of the work environment and to enjoy yourself. Everyone must go outside and participate in something other than school. I think its necessary for every kid to go outside and have some fun, play a sport or draw. Its very important to take a mental break and let you mind regroup and to do it in a way you enjoy! Not just a mental break but physically, working on a computer can give you head aches and neck pains. It helps to move around, even if your in a club. To get your hands on, is something every kid should experience. It could be making a poster or picking up trash, everybody should participate.

A long day at school can cause stress and pressure, one way to release that is by joining a club or sport. Mental health is extremely important, and sometimes we forget about it. Doing something you enjoy gets rid of all that stress built up and every student should release it by doing something they like. We are always being pushed by our teachers to do our best and to try our hardest, but sometimes we need something to relax to, and something we truly look forward to. Relaxation is key to being mentally healthy. Some students dont get the chance to relax, there fore all the students must participate in something relaxing to them. All students should be able to particpate in a activity without there being pressure to do the best. Students should have to have the time to relax and enjoy what they are participating in.

When being required to do an extracurricular activity, students tend to have more productivity. They tend to be more relaxed and put more effort into what they are doing. They are able to try there best in result of having some free time to relax and have fun. Students are more motivated to work, and are mentally and physically prepared to work. There grades might even increase and they might be, in whole, a lot happier. As their productivity and motivation improve so does their focus. In having their own time to take a break and relax they are better focused on their work when it comes time. Having more focus means more work getting done. Students are better at getting their work done on time, learning more and/or better, and are more motivated in school.

Therefore being required to participate in an extracurricular activity improves there over all well being.

4B2A3D04660A,"Imagine knowing you are going to be bored at home. Or that all of your friend were in an extracurricular activity and you weren't. Relax by playing with your friends or singing your heart out onstage. An extracurricular activity would be a great thing for you to try. I agree with this decision, because it would be a good way to learn new things, if you choose a sport as an activity it could teach you discipline, and it can help you make new lifelong friends.

It can be a great lace to learn new things. Some students parents don't teach them how to do certain things like how to be a leader. So if that kid joined something like Beta Club the teacher over that club could. It could help you get a job when you are older. Say during an extracurricular activity you were to learn a new skill. You could use that skill for a future job. It could be an unusual thing and no one else knows how to do it but you do. It could make you a lot of money in the future.

It can be a great place for a child to get disciplined. If they played sports a coach is most likely not going to deal with disrespect. Most athletes would get kicked out if they said or did something disrespectful i front of their coach , so they would learn not to be disrespectful without their coaches watching them. So in a way it would also benefit the parent or guardian. It would help them later in life when they get a job. You can't just disrespect your boss, unless you want to lose your job.

It can also be a great place to make lifelong friends. You may not find someone you have something in common with during regular school, because you are just doing school work. But if you were to participate in an extracurricular activity you can find someone you have something in common with and make a new friend. You can connect over football, baseball, or soccer. I can see why some people would disagree, because if you don't like talking to new people or it gives you anxiety it could be bad for you. But it can be great so you can work on your social skills without a teacher making you talk to them.

To conclude I agree with making everyone join an after school activity. It could help you learn new things, it could help you lean discipline for the future, and it could help you make new lifelong friends. There are a lot of pros of this happening. Even though some people wouldn't like it. I think the majority would. Also extracurricular activities are fun.

Having extracurricular activities required for students would be very helpful because it would give students a chance to meet new people.

Being involved in an extracurricular activity can be good because it will allow students to focus on something other then school work. As a honors student I am required to work very hard in and out of school and it can be very stressful at times. I am required to do homework every night and study for extended periods of time. However, I always look forward to going to dance because it allows me to take a break from all my school work and focus on something I really enjoy doing. It also allows me to relax because when I am done with dance I will be able to go back to my work with a more relaxed mindset. I think that having an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it allows students to take a break and focus on something other then school work.

Having to be in an extracurricular activity would make a good impact on students because it would keep them out of any trouble they would have out of school. I have seen many articles and stories where kids have had a bad background and have gotten into trouble in the past, but then they join an activity and it completely changes who they are as a person. They start to get better grades and start to care more about the people around them and in their community. I think that having students join a activity in or out of school could possibly change their life in a very positive way. There for, I agree that making an extracurricular activity required would be very beneficial because it could keep kids out of any trouble they might get into.

In conclusion, being in an extracurricular activity for me has made a very good impact on my life and as changed my life in a very positive way. It also gives other students something more to do then school work because at times school can be very stressful. So I agree that making extracurricular activities required would be good because it will give students a chance to meet new people, focus on something other than school work and it will keep students out of any trouble that they might have out of school.  ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
90ED5CDDE123,"The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is this a good or a bad thing? Answering this question is quite simple, because there is only one correct answer. All students participating in an activity is an excellent thing. There are several reasons why kids should be in extracurricular activities. Kids should partake in extracurricular activities because of the social benefits, students will learn valuable life skills, and there are numerous health benefits.

Firstly, students need social skills to survive everyday life. Many kids in this day and age lack the basic social skills they need to excel in life. Joining the different extracurricular activities that the school has to offer can help with that issue. Students will make new friends and build bonds that could last for the rest of their lives. Making friends isn't always the easiest thing to do. But being with people that are interested in the same activity as the student will help. Communication is key in the world. Talking through social media or text is all kids know. Being apart of a group will force the kids to communicate verbally. Talking verbally is a struggle for many kids and it's important that they learn how to. Once students grow up they will have to talk face to face. It's imperative that the schools teach this skill or kids will struggle further in life. Another reason is that team working skills can be learned through extracurricular activities. Students will have to work together to complete tasks or solve issues. In adulthood teamwork is a necessary skill to have. Teaching kids basic social skills at an early age will benefit them in the future.

Secondly, kids will learn excellent life skills while participating in extracurricular activities. Responsibility is one of those life skills. Whether it's a club, sport or some other type of activity kids will learn how to be responsible. For example, kids will have to take on certain duties for their activity. Time management will be necessary, because kids will have to make time for everything in their life. Both of those are great examples of how kids will have to become responsible. Another great thing extracurricular activities can give students is ambition and healthy competitiveness. Both of which are great qualities to have to be a leader. Leadership skills is an important thing that kids should have. There will be captains, presidents, or mentors in almost all of extracurricular activities. Students can become a leader in their activity. Being a leader will help students learn what it's like to have power. This will also cause students to have the ability to help their fellow students. Kids are the future leaders of the world. It's important that they have the skills to be able to lead the world. Many kids are too dependent or they could be smothered by people in their life. This causes students to not know how to handle things on their own. Extracurricular activities will give kids the chance to be independent. Students will have to handle certain situations or make decisions on their own. It's important for kids to have a decent level of independence and to not be babied their whole life. Kids won't be able to take care of themselves in adulthood, because they were reliant on the adults in their childhood. Those were just a few examples of the amazing life skills kids will learn by partaking in activities.

Lastly, extracurricular activities will benefit kids mentally and physically. There are many health benefits of activities. Depression is an issue that many people have to deal with. It has been said that kids have been suffering from depression a lot over the past few years. Many kids feel alone or that they have no friends. Being in an extracurricular activity can show students that they are not alone. Children will feel less lonely if they are apart of something with other people. Students can bond over their struggles and even get help. Extracurricular activities can act as a support group for many students. It doesn't have to be just loneliness or depression. Kids that have a bad home life can find comfort in the group. Also, kids can become more confident in themselves. A problem that many kids face is the lack of self confidence. This can affect their grades, friendships, and most importantly their happiness. There are many other circumstances that kids might face. But all of the kids can share their pain and find peace inside of their group. Not only can activities improve mental health they can improve physical health. Many kids don't receive the proper amount of physical activity or even sunlight they need. Most children stay inside and are glued to their devices, which can lead to health problems later in life. Extracurricular activities can help children get out of the house and do something. Sports are a great example of an activity that will get kids moving. Mental and physical health aren't always a priority to society but they should be.

The principal enforcing extracurricular activities will have many positive effects on students. Social skills, the ability to communicate, and team working skills will be a great lesson that kids will learn. Students will become more responsible, independent and have enough leadership skills to run their own business. Being in an extracurricular activity will benefit the emotional, mental, and physical health of students. All of these things are highly important to be successful and happy in life. Many kids lack some of the skills listed previously, which is why it's a great idea to enforce extracurricular activities. Kids will be happier, better people, and more prepared for the future. Who would want children to not be any of those things? The answer to that is no one. In conclusion, all students should be in an extracurricular activity because of the social benefits, kids will learn necessary skills, and there are several health benefits. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E3A2C937BE5C,"If you were or are a student who and was suddenly forced by your principle to participate in extracurricular activities how would you feel. you would probably not like to have to do something regardless of what you think. It could give you hardly anytime to do what you want to do with your life, maybe you like the idea of playing a sport or writing a story but not everyone has the time or interest in stuff like that.

There is many negative effects on the students and teachers that are caused by the principles decision to force extra work on the students and teachers of my school, I believe that there is not reason for extra work.

being force to do something that you don't want to do is annoying but tolerable, but when it is not letting you have any time for yourself its too far.

There are many negative effects on the students. Anything can be effected by someones decisions or actions, I believe that the Principle's decision to force students to participate in extracurricular activates will only negatively effect them and make things harder for them in the future. Students have it hard enough going to school five times a week, having homework, and projects and still have to deal with life at home like choirs or maybe they have an after school job that they need to do, what ever it may be students have it hard enough and would not appreciate it if they were forced to do more than they already have to do.

Students are not the only ones who are effected from this unfair change, the students need teachers to teach them and keep them in check.

Like students teachers have a life of there own and don't need more work to do.

Their is not reason for extra work. There is no good reason why students need to work harder than they already do, if anything is is doing the opposite of what it is try to do, intended giving students a chance to find something new or get better at what they like it forces then to ether do something they are not comfortable doing or not letting people work on what they want to do in the way they want to do it. Nobody likes to be forced to do something, even if it is something they are interested in it only makes them feel like they are being controlled.

The reasoning is not right, not everyone is the same and some people don't have the option to try new things but this is not the way to do it and I think that many students would agree with me saying that.

this will cause more good than bad fro the people involved in this decision. In the end people are not just going to like something because you make them do it, you have to let them do things on their own, forcing people to do things will only make them dislike it.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A4648DC5FA2A,"The thought of extracurricular activity is a great idea in my opinion because I have a lot of free time out of school and I would love to spend it doing sports or clubs. But my opinion might not be the same for a lot of other people who may not like going outside and playing or being around other people. Most kids love to hang out with friends, but for me I enjoy just playing a little bit of basketball everyday then getting on my xbox and playing basketball game, thats just what i am good at.

Some of the pros about having these extra activities are that a lot of kids are able to meet new friends to hang out with. It can also get many kids for in shape with their body if they just so happen to choose a sport to play, but some kids may not be in to that and i am ok with that so they might choose a club which can give many kids a opportunity to have fun with other people who they might have not even known the name of before.

But there are many cons to this decision aswell. A lot of kids will just not be interested in the idea as many others would but that might not stop them from exploring what they can do or are good at. The club or activity can inter vein with the kids home life with their parents because if the kid has to stay after school a lot they will not be home to spend time with their family or have a hot dinner ready for them. The sports part of it can also mess with kids friendships and cause them to make enemies or get seriously injured play that sport.

In my opinion I think that the sports and clubs should stay optional but add more emphasis to it, make kids want to do it, for me if it was non optional I would enjoy it a lot but thats just me. it would be fun better overall for the students if they have never really been into clubs and sports like others kids have been into their whole lives.

So for me I think its has its own ups and down for kids but it should stay optional aswell as enforcing it more. please make this a thing I would love it so much because i cant play many sports, basketball is my one and only thing I am good at do I would love to expand into other sports.                                                                                  ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
D84271FC252A,"Have you ever wondered where your best friend was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new.

Signing up for an activity you have never heard of before or haven't done before can be challenging, not knowing what to expect can be very nerve racking but thats how you learn what you like. You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new.

Theres always a mixed variety so chances are there will be at least one option that can be interesting. I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety.

Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.

My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.   ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B7ECC3A7AD2B,"Participating in an after school activity is important, but should not be required. Not everybody would want to be forced to do a extracurricular activity because a lot of the people who don't, exercise on their own. Even though activities are healthy physically and mental, they should not be forced upon students or anybody, it should be their choice of how their future will be, no one should choose for them. Even doing something to help out the school would be a bad idea because that would extend a lot of the students school hours. Some students like to do homework at their home, not at school. Others have pets that they need to take care of and if their parents sent them to the vet for the day, that would cost a lot of money for them. Others could have had a horrible day and would want to go home immediately, but they would be forced too stay and that would make them feel much worse. Because students are stressed through out most of the day, staying after school for at least an hour a day would be bad for their brains. Yes I agree that after school activities is a good idea, but forcing it would take the fun out of it. Students should be able to choose what they do in their lives, not having it already chosen. Causing more stress for a student could be bad for their future, stress leads to headaches which leads to migraines, which is bad for the brain. An unhealthy brain would affect the students overall grade in school. If a student is stressed out, it will be harder for them to sleep the following night due to their brains being worn out. Students in middle school already get very little sleep from the early school hours, they will get less sleep from stress from school. If their bodies to not already produce a certain amount of meletonin, (The substance the brain produces to cause sleep) it will be much harder for them to sleep. Sleep for students and adults is very important because it effects their everyday lives. More students staying after school will also cause the teachers to have more stress from the students complaining that they are being help hostage or something in a joking way. The teachers would get annoyed from that very quickly, which would cause stress in the future for them too.

For example, if a student was the head of the student council, that means that he could have to do extra work at home instead of getting free time which helps calm the brain down. If he/she had ADHD such as myself, they might not know how to handle it as well as others with the same condition, it could make them very upset and they would not do the work, but they would be stressed because they would need to turn it in. If a kid did sports and got injured while playing or in their free time, it would affect their ability to play the sport and affect their performance in Physical Education of which would affect their grade. Somebody who does not play a sport but exercises in their free time would be forced to play a sport or stay after school and do an activity would most likely be unhappy due to the loss of their free time. I am not saying that students should not play a sport or stay after school, because they should be able to exercise in their own time and stay after school for an activity that they have chosen. Exercise is important for everybody, but it should not be forced, they will be the ones to live with their own consequences. If that where to happen. Students would fall asleep in class from being to tired to stay awake. Students would need multiple breaks through out the school day to keep them engaged knowing that they will have to stay after school. Others will be exited because that means that they will get to play sports more often because they find sports enjoyable, as others do not. If the students who play sports are passionate about sports and they lose their game, they would become upset which would cause stress because they would practice more often thinking that they will never win which could cause a breakdown from not achieving their goal under a lot of unneeded stress. If they win a game, then play against the same team again, they would think that they would easily win again, but lose due to being cocky. which would lead the the breakdown, then the other team would be cocky and so on and so forth. If at school the losing team could get mad at each other for not doing as well and could cause a fight between them, the fight would then affect their next game because they would be trying to out do each other.

Students who get in fights usually make up to each other, but not always. If they where best friends, there is a possibility that it would end up like a hockey fight without the sticks. Fights would probably suspend both of them, that would definitely effect their overall grade. The loss of a close friend or any friend at all would make them upset, which would then cause them to lose sleep the next few nights. When they are grown up, assuming they still have the record of the fight, it would be harder for both of them to get a job due to possible fights.

Most ideas on paper sound perfect if you don't think about it that much or don't think about it at all. But if you really go into detail and think of all of the possible outcomes, it becomes so much easier to find all of the flaws and becomes easier to fix them. To make a big change for students lives, you have to take the time and not rush to get it done, you have to think about preexisting conditions of some students. Consulting with the parents would also be helpful so you can see their point of view, take a vote and ease the students into a new change, not in the time span of a week or month, students would have to adapt to the change live an organism evolving to match its needs as the world changes. Because if the environment changes too quickly, the organism will die, and the death for us all is stress. Every possible outcome has to be considered for a big change, nothing should be instant.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
131D4EC3D03F,"Student's usual school day lasts about 6-8 hours. After school, students usually like to kick back and relax. Some student's might actually have things to do after-school, like sports or schoolwork. However, if they're principal takes that privilege away from them, they're after-school routine may change. Instead of having time to complete assignments, students may feel rushed to finish now that their extra time away from them. Schools should not require their students to take an extracurricular activity due to students not having time to commit to the activity, and because their stress levels may increase.

Students also might not be able to fully commit to an extracurricular activity because of their lack of time to do so. Students may already have an after-school activity that is not part of the school's extracurricular program. Some students actually need to stay home, not just to relax, but for their family. For instance, a student might need to stay home and watch over their younger sibling. Students should have a life out of school as well, and not be stuck in school every weekday. Extracurriculars, being mandatory, act as an obstacle in student's daily life. When students are out of school, they should use their extra time on things they want to do, not just things they have to do.

Being required to do extracurricular activities will also increases student's stress levels. Schoolwork is already very difficult for students by itself, why should they add on to this stress? Students need time after school to catch up on work, and what's keeping them from doing this? The mandatory extracurricular activities. Due to this amount of stress, student's may not get the chance to finish their work. Late assignments will increase, which will bring down student's grades very quickly. More missing work will increase, too, which will bring their grade down even more. Adding more after-school activities, whether it's academic or not, will cause students unnecessary stress.

So whats the issue? After-school activities block the chance for a student to actually live life out of school. School is very long and stressful, and students don't need added stress. Extracurricular activities are also very time consuming, and won't give students time to complete schoolwork or even attend other non-school related activities. Again, schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because students don't have time to attend them, and their stress levels will increase.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
836FC7F5F535,"Students shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do.

They can get easily fed up with doing things that they are forced to do.

So when a student that doesn't want to do a extracurricular activity, he or she would easily get fed up with it.

Which the student could drag that group down if he or she doesn't want to be in that group that does that extracurricular activity.

Here are some reasons why they shouldn't be forced to.

Students have things going on outside of school.

It can be about family, friends, school.

Now when a student has to do more work that adds on to what he or she already has to do, it can be hard on the student.

The student is now overloaded with work and can become stressed.

More work, can also hurt the students physical heath and mental health.

Mental health and physical health are the 2 big health's of the body that we all need to focus on.

With more work loaded on the student, he or she can become easily stressed.

Therefore, the student can get less sleep or have unhealthy eating habits.

In addition, with less sleep, the student is now tired and cannot think through thoroughly.

Also with the unhealthy eating habits due to stress, the student now has one more thing to worry about.

Out comes of student having mental and physical health in harm, such as being stressed with to much work can lead into bigger problems.

Depression or suicidal thoughts can rise in the students head.

Also the student can sabotage the group because he or she cannot get the work done.

In addition, he or she doesn't like it.

That student can also effect other students around the he or she.

Extracurricular activities fit some students and don't fit some students.

Students should still have the option to do extracurricular activities, but not be forced to.

As shown, it can affect mental health and physical health.

Also the student can do other things outside of school that he or she wants to do.

In addition, the student can have problems with his or her family that they are dealing with.

Work load can easily rise and stress can go through the roof for the student.

So students shouldn't be forced to do these extracurricular activities, but should always be an option.          ",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
D7148D8FC7F7,"Hey, Today I am going to convince readers that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, they are fun and helpful.

It can be fun by, playing games with your friends and other fun stuff you can think about. It can also be helpful by being a leader, if you want to do sports you can become stronger and more healthier, and the activities you do can also benefit your life in the future, for an example my dad said when he was little he really didnt play sports but when he start liking sports he started to get stronger and so now he gets paid for playing football in the NFL. And to be honest it not all about sports in this reading because other activities like serving in the student council and working on the yearbook can get you to good places academic wise like a good college and a good job.

One time me and my friends was doing art for an activity and a famous painter came and gave the three of us free passes to take drawing lessons with him, all of us was so excited! See look if we would have never did the activity we would have never got those free lessons and now we might become famous painters/drawers.

There are a lot of other activities but my favorite activity is cooking because cooking can take you a lot of places in the world and I love to eat. There are about 93% of people that cook in the

World and thats a lot of people. You can even use cooking for yourself and others. You can use cooking for yourself by cooking for yourself like how are you going to survive without eating and if you cook for yourself than you can save money by not paying for other food. Did you know that you can even get paid for cooking for other people? You can work at a restaurant or you can even own a restaurant. Either way you can make money or save money and money is good.

I hope that you have made a destion on doing an extracurricular activity. I already gave you the options its just now based on your opinion.

DB5EA842EE5C,"I don't think that it is a good thing to force students to participate in a extracurricular activity. Some students might not have transportation to pick them up from the activity after school. Some students just want to go home and relax after school. The school should just let the students choose what they want to do instead of forcing them to do it. I disagree with this decision because not all students have transportation from the activities, not all students have the energy to do something after school, and there is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities.

Not all students have transportation from the extracurricular activity. Some students' parents work all day and don't have the time to pick their child up from those activities. Most kids just ride the bus home because their parents are still working when school ends. For example, lets say that there is a students that normally rides the bus home. If that student's parents work until seven o'clock at night, than the bus is that student's only transportation home.

Not all students have the energy after school to do any other activities. Some students might not get enough sleep at night and are tired throughout the school day. Maybe some students have a young sibling that they have to help take care of. That could cause them to have less energy than normal. Some students skip breakfast, which causes them to have less energy during the day too.

There is already plenty of students that do extracurricular activities. For example we have enough for all the sports teams to have a full team. Not only do we have enough, but those students want to do those activities and haven't been forced to do it. There will always be some group of students that want to do a extracurricular activity. There is no need to force students to participate in a extracurricular activity.

Forcing students to participate in a extracurricular activity is unnecessary. Some students don't have transportation from the activity. Some students don't have the energy after school.

83ED986D8BC0,"Have you ever tried an in-school sport or club? Many students enjoy extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. But some students aren't as keen on the idea. Some think it's a waste of time, or that they're very boring. But extracurricular activities help students and schools in many different ways. I think students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity because the students will learn new skills, students will become more social, and the school will become more diverse in it's interests.

There are many skills to be learned in extracurricular activities. Depending on what activity it is, you can be taught a wide variety of talents. After school sports will teach you the basics to the game, and then maybe you'll make it to the school team for that sport. Certain clubs will teach students other games and talents. At my old school, there was a huge chess club. Some of the kids that went to it every Wednesday didn't even know how to play at first. Then they learned, as any other student could if they attended a mandatory extracurricular activity. Some clubs can even teach students the basics of just being a good student or friend, like the homework club, or the diversity club. So if every student took a mandatory extracurricular activity, everyone would learn a lot.

Students can become more social through extracurricular activities. The more students spend time with people with similar interests, the more friends they'll make. If a student was to only hangout with the same group of friends all year, he or she would never become more social, which is a good skill to have as you get older. Besides, a student might make a life long friend through an extracurricular activity. Even if a student doesn't make any new friends through extracurricular activities, they'll still have learned important communication and social skills.

If a school has a large variety of extracurricular activities that every student is attending at least one, the school will become more diverse in the student's intersests. Diversity in a school is very important for many reasons. Diversity would look good on how the rest of the county views the school. Then they might follow suite and make extracurricular activities mandatory. Another reason why diversity in a school is important because the students will impact each other and make each other want to try more activities, making a postitive cycle in which students want to partcipate in extracurricular activities, therefore benefiting them in the other ways, social and skill benefits.

In all, mandatory extracurricular activities will help our school system in plenty of ways. They'll teach students skills, make students more social, and make the school more diverse. These are just some of the reasons that schools need mandatory extracurricular activities. If you want madatory extracurricular activities at your school, start a petitionfor your principal to see. Even if that doesn't work, you can always just convince your friends and classmates to go to these extracurricular activities. This is why I believe schools should have mandatory extracurricular activities.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
E3B5F5E76B04,"Imagian getting home from school at around five and then doing homework till like seven or eight sounds crazy right well thats what will happen if students are fourced to do an extracurricular activity. Us students simply wouldn't have time for anything else which is why I disagree with making students dp a curricular activity. Some of us students just don't have the time and are far to busy with things like getting home late, doing homework or studing, plus some kids babysit.

The first reason I disagree is because some parents don't get off work till really late and wont be abke to pick up their kid on time from practice. Parents might not be able to drop their kids off at the games or turnemnts and the kid may fell as tho they let the team down. Plus if family were to pick them up then they would be stuck at a family member's house and unable to go home and do what they need to.

The second reson is some kids have giant amounts of homework and studing to do. If you make a student do a sport or a club then homework won't be done till really late. This will cause kids to have no time outside or to hang with friends. Which may lead to them not doing homework or studing that way they can go outside with friends,thus causing grades to slip.

The third and final reason is some students our age have to babysit their younger sibling or cousin. However, with an after school activity they will not return home in time to watch said family members. And lets not forget that some students have jobs as babysitters for other people's kids.

Now I understand that some people may say ""oh but it's good for young children to do an after school activity and I agree, however some students are far to busy and should not be fourced to do an after school activity its not that we're lazy or anything we'er just to busy.

FE776C83FE1B,"This would be good for students in many ways. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things that come from having a extracurricular activity. Principal's should start doing this in all schools . Its really nice to get students out of their comfert zone sometimes. Students normally don't try for sports in school because they don't want to go through the fact if they don't make the team. Its hard for some people to go and try for something but some students don't think to themselfs if i dont try i will never know if im good at any sport.

Most students stay at home and be lazy all day. Being lazy is not good for the body and brain. Getting in a sport is amazing because people might have to take care of their little brother's or sister's and don't have time to take care of themselfs first or people might have other things to do but its always nice to put your health first. People can be very lazy and just lay around and eating junk food and playing video games all day and this is a good way to get outside and be with your friends. Alot of things that people are probably doing right now is not heathy for them, eating junk food is not good, playing video games and being on your phone to much hurts your eyes and its really important if u want to try for a sport if your eyes are good. It's just a great way to get kids off their phone and go outside.

Students tend to not socialies if they don't have to. Most teens in middle school lay in bed and scroll though instagram all day and night. Sports is a great way to get your social skills up. Some people are shy as well and might not try as well the first day ,however, students will get used to doing stuff in front of other people are give it there all. It's a great way to get kids out if their comfert zone and talk to new people they though they would never talk to.

We all know sitting at home is not that fun. Everyone gets bored at home and have not idea what to do, you run out of things to do on your phone and if you have no friends that live close to you it's very hard to find something to do. Doing a after school activity gets your mind off of things and gives you something to do after school. Being with friends is always fun when your doing something you want to do. People tend to just try out for a sport but not really try at the sport. Most students just go to talk to their friends and put no effort in the sport. You still have to try and put in a lot of effort going in to this kind of activity.

Principals should make kids pick a extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision becasue all students should have fun and do something they would not do. Exersising, being more social, and having fun are all good things about doing a sport after school. You should go out and try for any sport you can and you can get better and better everyday. Nobody is holding you back from doing something you want to try doing.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BF950D449303,"Schools shouldn't force students to do extracurricular activities because that can induce stress and not have time to spend with your family. On the other hand some people believe it's better in order for students to be academically inclined to do well in school.

Having students forced into extracurricular activities can lead to stress which can eventually impact students negatively. Negative stress can lead to failing classes, bad house habits and suicide.

For example stress leading to class failing can really have a big impact on a students life if they have to repeat a grade, it can possibly make it harder for them to graduate and even find a stable job. So if these bad impacts happen then society might just perish due to stress given off by forced extracurricular activities. Stress really can lead up to fatal consequences if there's enough stress going around because of forced extracurricular activities. People usually do well if there is nothing that stresses them out but with forced extracurricular activities the stress will double and even triple in the size it was mentally before hand. Forced extracurricular activities can also lead up to time spent with family decrease.

Forced extracurricular activities could take a significant amount of family time away impacting the students relationship with their family and those around. This could make a stable family unstable and make them argue often because the student isn't on the same page as the family due to family time loss from going to the forced extracurricular activity after school. This can also impact a students mental and emotional health for example there are many students with elderly people whom they cherish, they might have little time to live so time with them can have a major impact on their emotional health. But if time where taken away these students won't spend the amount of time they need with the elderly to be emotionally stable since the elderly might die any day. If this happens students might learn to associate school with bad things that keep you away from those whom you cherish deeply.

Forced extracurricular activities shouldn't exist due to reasons like stress and family time loss, which can mentally, emotionally and academically affect students due to extracurricular activities. This is why forced extracurricular activities shouldn't ever surface in this beautiful country we know as The United States.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
AC7FEF69749E,"Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with the principal because extracurricular activities are very important, not only to your health, but to your fututre. Colleges have started looking into extracurricular activities more now then before. Not to mention how much fun they can be.

College is important. It helps set you up for your job and 'adult readiness', but first, you have to get into college. Applications are important, they are a main factor in getting into college, but I wouldn't neccesarily call it your 'make or break'. Grades are exceedingly important when applying for college, but extracurricular activities are just as important. Extracurricular activities can help show that you can commit to something, follow through with it, and you might be very good at it. The more extracurricular activities, the better. For example, let's say an A average student who did no extracurricular activities applies for a college. Another B average student who did one or two extracurricular activities applies for the same college. The B average student is more likely to make it into the college than the A

average student because of their extracurricular activities.

Extracurricular activities can mean many things. It can mean sports, clubs, volunteering, and many more. Sports are well-known to be good for your health. It helps you exercise and stay in good shape. Laziness, especial in teenagers nowadays, is very common. Being required to move and exercise would do our health and body good. Even if we don't do a sport and we chose a club. Clubs normally make you exercise your brain and make you think in a different way than school usually requires you to.

Finally, it can be fun! Many people who do extracurricular activites found that they liked a certain activity more than others. I, for one, have that expieriance. I tried many sports such as soccer, basketball, baseball, swimming, and ballet. I thouroughly enjoyed swimming, baseball, and ballet. However, I didn't do baseball. Now, I'm on pointe in my ballet and going on to my eleventh year of dance and my summer swim team was the Division and Finals champions. I love my extracurricular activities and I feel as though my life would be fairly boring without them.

There are so many benefits in doing extracurricular activities and being required to participate is merely helping you get the leg up on your future. In the end, it's all worth it, every bit. It does so much good in your life that you won't even relise it until your older. Therefore, I agree and support the principal in their decision.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
04AF157D14EA,"Students should be told to do at least one extracurricular at school because doing an extracurricular can help students become more physically healthy, they can leave a lasting impression on their school and they can meet new people. All these can come from doing an extracurricular activity after school. I agree with this decision by the principal since most pupils will have good outcomes by doing an extracurricular activity. Students have a wide range of choices for their activity for example, students could choose to participate in sports such as baseball or basketball, work in the math club, the model U.N.

All the clubs you can think of the school most likely provides for their students to choose, however out of all the good reasons to force students to participate in these extra activities do have some setbacks. Some of these setbacks include the fact that maybe some students have responsibilities after school such as babysitting, jobs or religious reasons.

First, Students who choose to be apart of clubs such as the Student Government or National Junior Honor Society can revolutionize their school and create change in rules that they do not favor as much as other rules. These clubs usually encourage free thinkers and people who wanna to create change and revitalize their school when it gets a little stale and boring. Some kids might join a sports team or musical ensemble and win a championship or a musical trophy that the school can proudly display like all the other trophies that the school has won. Most schools are very proud of their pupil's accomplishments in or out of school usually displaying their accomplishments such as their students who went to the NBA like Kobe Bryant or became very famous actors like Tom Cruise.

Nelson Mandela once said, ""Education is the key to life and happiness"" and if that is true partially extracurricular can help you achieve that. As most colleges look at your application form they look at your Grades ACT and SAT but what they also look at is what extracurricular you are in such as clubs, sports teams or musical acts such as a band or ensemble.

Next, students can become more physically healthy and fit when doing some activities after school. The main example of that is a school sports team that the students can join like track or swimming can help them lead a healthy lifestyle and lose weight while filling their requirements to do a school extracurricular activity. These school sanctioned activities can help students become more fit and lose weight because of the sport. Sports in general are a good way to teach kids to be healthy and not sit at home all day and lay in bed or on a couch all day after school. Kids are easily impressionable to anything or anyone that tells them what they like such as a junk food commercial or a commercial for sugary cereal, these commercials tell them that the cereal that they are marketing is healthy but in reality it is just a sugary full of carbohydrates cereal. By letting kids stay after and teaching them what foods are healthy for them or not we can reduce the impact that childhood obesity has caused the last couple of years.

Lastly, most students who participate in after school activities can meet a lot of new people who are interested in the same things as you are and you can talk to them in the clubs or other activities you have joined. Most people who join clubs are often interested in the same things as everyone else in that club, there even some clubs just about certain interests such as the anime club which is just a club for kids who like anime or manga. Other clubs and extracurricular are also good places to meet new people if you are new to a school and need people to talk to.

these friends you make can become lifelong friends of yours even out of school and into college or the workforce and adulthood. These bonds that you make in middle school and high school can increase your social skills and help you with life skills like communication with other people, a skill needed in jobs like marketing where you most likely need to present in front of other people sometimes including your boss.

In conclusion, being told to do one extracurricular by your school isn't the end of the world you can make it fun by choosing a club or sport that you enjoy to do and it will not be a burden on you or your family. In these extra activities you can create a better you and show your school that, you can become healthier and you can always meet new people who share common interests with you. All the students are required to do an extracurricular most likely because the school just wants the best for you and your academic career whether that is from K-12 or beyond to college and the workforce extracurricular help you in many ways throughout your life, these clubs ensembles and teams can boost your self confidence, fortify your social skills while you have fun since you have chosen things that interest you and are not boring.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
4423B65DF221,"There has always been extracurricular activities being offered in schools, even in my old house in Generic_City, but many students don't take advantage of these resources given to them. This is why I believe that students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. I make this claim for three reasons, the first of which being that students are more involved in the community that the school built around them. My second reason is that students doing sport related activities helps with exercise and having the need to stay in shape for the team and the school. Last but not least, my third reason is that students that may not have many friends could use these activities as a way to get to know people that are doing the same sport or are in the same band. So I believe that these extracurricular activities would be beneficial not only to the students but the school as a whole.

For my first reason I stated that doing an extracurricular activity helps students get involved in a community that was created around them. Students that join sports or other activities provided usually get to know others that participate in the same team or group that the student does. Another reason to back up my claim is that in clubs or competitive sports teams these students generally train together and help each other succeed in the task that they are working towards achieving. I believe that these activities would help tremendously with letting students get to know each other and further strengthening the schools community.

My second claim is that doing extracurricular sports help students get exercise that generally they would not get, had they not been told to do any exercise outside of school. If these students play for a school team (football, wrestling, etc.) there is intense training involved that from, personal experience, is not easy. Im not saying to go run a mile or anything but these sports try to get every competitor in great condition in order to get students to succeed in tournaments and bouts or matches against other teams. So there is a huge exercise component to most sport related activities.

For my third reason, let's start with a small story. So, imagine that there is a student that moves around every two to four years. it was pretty difficult to make friends so he generally stayed at home playing video games by himself and didn't really go out at all. That was me until around three years ago and doing sports like wrestling and rugby have helped me make friends. So I understand how difficult it is to always be the new kid but these activities let me make friends and get to know people. Students that do these activities usually make friends with the people that have the same interests in activities.

I believe that enforcing this rule would be beneficial not only to the school but the students as well and these reasons are why I believe in this rule. Communities get built around the students when they do these extracurricular activities. Physical fitness is also a big motivator for a few students with sports related activities. And last but not least, these students can make friends in these activities like I did when I used to move around a lot. Extracurricular activities would be a good service to enforce in schools.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
3441F00346EA,"I would agree with the decision to make all students participate in after school activity. I would agree with this decision for a couple of different reasons. One of them would be bringing people together. Parents may start to think and appreciate the teachers more for going above and beyond staying after school to work with there kids. This would paint a new path and a new picture for the schools future.

Not only only would extracurricular activities get more students and teachers working together forming good relations, but it would help students see teachers and the school in a new light. Students may start to appreciate there teachers more and may start to like them. Students could feel more confident with there teachers because they share some of the same interests. Not only this but the teachers may get to see how hard working there students are working outside of school, and maybe the students just need a push or in other words a little bit of help.

I feel like parents also would appreciate getting the kids off there butts and getting them to interact with there fellow teachers and students. By making encouraging there kids to have a open mind about after school activities they could also find out what there schools offer and possibly the parents could be interested. The students who look at taking after school activities with a good attitude will get hooked and find something they really enjoy. When the students come home from there extracurricular activities they could tell there parents all about it and maybe teach there parents something they dont know.

When you sign up or good to a after school activity try and go with at least one friend who is also interested in the same topic. This will give you a safe feeling and you will have someone to share the fun with you! Not only will you have one friend there but if you bring a friend there is a 100% chance you will make more friends there. The teachers will find it very exciting you found a extracurricular activity you enjoy and made new friends. With all the work you will be doing in your after school activity at least when it gets hard you will have a friend next to you to make it better.

In conclusion I think this is a very positive decision made by the principal and agree with it completely. There are so many benefits to going to after school activities. Meeting new people and finding interests you may have never new about. For all you know you could have found a career you love and want to do as a job. Finding new friends and meeting new teachers and strengthening you relationship with your teachers is a very smart thing to do. I would highly recommend other schools to do the same as this school and help your students find a activity they love.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
BF795A45BEA1,"After school activities should be optional because kids might not have the time, it could cause stress, and some kids wouldn;t be interested. Why should a student be forced into an activity when they have chores? what about the amount of extra stress? Plus, sports and yearbook aren't everyone's favorite thing.

As stated before, some kids don't have time for things like activities. A student might have to babysit a sibling, do chores, work around the house, or even have a job!

There's no reason for making extra activities mandatory. Meetings early in the morning? Less sleep for growing children. After school? There's enough at home to handle. Even the middle of class wouldn't work, as the student would fall behind.

Not only will it mess up a kids schedule, it'll cause stress. Life can be stressful for students. Especially when dealing with tests, quizzes, and changes to the student. Add in an activity that'll cause them to have less distressing time and you'll have a meltdown waiting to happen. You can't expect a student to be able to handle that. If students actively pick an activity to do, it's because they know they can handle the time management.

And finally, Not everyone is going to be interested. Sure, the students might be cool with it for the first week, but then it'll be bothersome and annoying. Activities should be optional, not mandatory. It takes the fun out of everything. Whether you let the students pick or not, it won't matter. Not everyone wants to join the sports team. Not everyone wants to work for the yearbook. Some people would prefer going home and relaxing at the end of the day.

While it seems like a good idea, mandatory participation should't be a thing. Most kids are trying to spend time with family, not giving them time to do sports. Some people might already be stressing over tests and grades, causing more stress in activities. And let's not forget that not everyone would be interested in kicking a ball around or painting. It may be for the best, but it's also the worst to make activities mandatory.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DB06022F504E,"From ballet to yearbook, there are many extracurricular activities you can take part in, but there are more benefits that come with extracurricular activities than meets the eye. Some people don't do extracurricular activities because of fear and uncertainty. Avoiding extracurricular activities can have a negative impact on your life. There are many benefits, long term and short term, to doing extracurricular activities. If extracurricular activities are made mandatory, it can help students overcome fears and find things they're passionate about. Making extracurricular activities compulsory for students will help them by creating new friendships, helping them get into collage and giving students new experiences.

Making extracurricular activities compulsory will help students make friends and build relationships. Engaging in extracurricular activities will help students find people they have something in common with. For example, last year I was in the green eagles club and I met a lot of people I might not have hung out with otherwise. Going to clubs and after school activities will help student meet people they would not usually be friends with and help broaden your perspectives.

Many students are shy and have a hard time making friends, but if extracurricular activities are made mandatory it will help pull them out if their shells and develop social skills which are incredibly important throughout life. Having all student go to extracurricular activities will also introduce kids to many different types of people so that they have a better view of the world.

Engaging in extracurricular activities can help you get into a good collage. While collages will look at your grades, they will also look at your extracurricular activities. Collages want not only smart people but also well rounded people who have many interests and will bring something to their school. When I asked my cousin, who goes to Generic_School, about when he applied for collage he said that collages will look at tons of people with good grades but what makes you stand out is your extracurricular activities and the extra things you do. Therefore, if it's mandatory for kids to do extracurricular activities, they will have a higher chance of getting into a good collage and this will help them in the long run.

Taking part in extracurricular activities will give students new experiences. Whether it's being in an uncomfortable situation or just hanging out with your friends, your experiences are important because they are part of what shapes who you are as a person. If students take part in extracurricular activities, they might even find something they truly enjoy doing. Being in an extracurricular activity will expose students to other ideas and cultures which will in turn broaden their perspectives and make them more empathetic. When I was in sixth grade and I told one of my friends I was vegetarian, she said sorry, looking at me with pity. After a while she learned that I chose to be vegetarian, and that I enjoy it. This changed her perspective on what vegetarians are like and has made her more aware. When you expose kids to ideas, especially controversial ones, it helps them start to formulate their own opinions bases of of what they think and not what others tell them to think. It is very important that all people are exposed to others who are different to themselves and if all students take extracurricular activities, they will benefit through learning about their peers.

Building relationships with people is an important skill that will be used throughout life and extracurricular activities will force students to be in positions where they will make friends. In the long run, extracurricular activities will help you in many ways such as getting you into a good collage which will eventually help you lead a good life. Taking extra curricular activities will make you a more well rounded and aware person and might even help you discover a passion. On top of this, by taking an extracurricular activity, students will gain new experiences which will broaden their perspectives. It is vital that students are exposed to other cultures and types of people because this will over all help to shape their out look on the world and make them more empathetic human beings. If extracurricular activities become mandatory, students will benefit because, they will make friends, it will help them get into collage, and give students new experiences.",6,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2C0D4A3D4590,"I disagree, because some times there is nothing there that interest. Many schools dont have a program that people like. So if they force some one to do something that they dont like it could make them frustrated. There is something good to it. It can make them try new stuff.

It can get them interested new jobs they can try. A new future they can try to achieve. it could also make them a more interesting person. More possible people talk to about the topic. But they could despise the topic.

Than forcing them in to it could make the hate it more. There could be some personal stuff that do's not let them join a club. some personal trauma that makes them less likely to join a club. it could also be that they just dont want to do it. Being part of a sports team is also very physically demanding.

There is always chance they could not make it on the team. Plus there is always a chance of being kicked out of the club or team. Plus if you try a sport out and figure out that you dont like it you can always quit. There is always a chance that the club could not even help you in the real world. There could be no real world implication.

Well my principle thinks that all students must participate in some type of activity or sport during school. I have a few opinions on that. First of all there are different types of people. Not everyone likes to participate in sports or activities. Theres also people that aren't very social so, participating in anything might not be there thing. Then theres some that are just lazy. On the other side their are people that like to participate and be social with people. Theres actually interested in sports or school activities. But sometimes poeple just want to talk with their friends. I think it should't be required to participate in school activities. You should be able to choose what you want to do. Like if you don't participate you should just be able to hangout with your friends while, others can play sports or participate in activities. If some poeple choose to do sports or be in any sort of activity thats great for them.

School Principals Should Not Require Extracurricular Activities

Their are many benefits to participating in after school activities, they can improve your knowledge on a variety of topics, introduce you to new experiences, provide a chance to strengthen your social skills, and most of all they can be enjoyable! They are not usually enjoyable however, when you have been forced into taking them, and especially not when everyone in your school has been forced to also. There are many reasons why students don't want to or even can't partake in these activities some of which being that it is a financial struggle for many families, it causes a stress for time, and can lead to disappointment.

Some parents cannot afford to pay the fees required to enroll their children in extracurricular activities. Imposing a rule that these activities are mandatory would mean that they would have to spend the money that they need for other more important things in order to satisfy the principal's instructions. This would then deprive them of a comfortable home life since they would be unable to purchase certain needs, and even farther from receiving any desired luxuries. It may even endanger them because they are in an unsafe predicament that they can't afford to get out of.

The children's guardians might not have a flexible schedule that will allow them to take time to transport their child to and from their activities. Making them required would result in parents having to take time off of work or enlist others to either accomplish their home responsibilities or pick up their child from the school activity. The students would suffer from time deprivation as well. Time that the students should be spending on school work or family interaction would instead be put towards their activities. They would also not have any time to develop personal hobbies since they would be participating in arranged activities.

Because every student would be enrolling in school clubs at once there would be high competition and a large portion of the students would end up in activities that they don't want. This would leave them disappointed about their assignment and disdainful of the principal's program. There is a possibility that it would even discourage them enough not to partake in similar activities in the future. Thus this requirement has more of a possibility of restricting the students strengths and cutting their future options further in life.

Though there are some rewards that come with participating in extracurricular activities not everyone should have to. Each person has different factors to consider when choosing whether or not to join an after school club or sport. Furthermore, it should be up to the student and their family to decide if they can participate in these groups.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
329FDFF9DAEF,"Making students participate in a extracirricular activity would be a good idea. Extracirricluar activities can help students gain more experience of physical strength, social activity and interaction, and new learning experiences. For example; A student who plays football outside of school can strengthen their physical and social health by playing with other team mates and working out at the same time, while maintaing new knowledge about the sport which would include new learning experiences too.

Participating in other activites outside of school can help a student figure out their true interests and help them discover carrers for the future. Making students try and learn something new can be beneficial if they are having trouble finding what peaks their interest. However, there may be some downfalls to this new idea. Extracirricular activites may sometimes not be so easy to manage. Especially with sports or activites for the school. Some activites can make students weeks feel stressful and overwhelming at times. Sometimes actvities can mess with the students outside life such as; traveling, family, religious purposes, etc.

Activites that are easily able to maintain with the persons schedule and peaks the students interest should be acceptable to participate in. New opportunities could come up for the student reguarding to college or even future jobs. If a student decides to choose this activity in the future, companies would see that they have extra experience and might increase their chance of giving or accepting job offers to that particular student. If he/she works hard in school and maintains a healthy schedule that would not affect them severly, the student might get a scholarship from many different colleges and major in that specific category.

He/she might even make new friends in their new activity and might increase their chance of wanting to continue doing the program with them. Making new friends is also beneficial and could help increase the persons chance of wanting to continue participating in this new sport or activity.

Overall, making students participate in extracirricular activites outside of school or for the school would be great to improve the students physical, social, and emotional health, help the sudent gain more knowledge about the acitvity, and decide future carrers and interests.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DF5281802CF1,"""My biggest in life is to help kids believe that they can be anything when they grow up.""-Kobe Bryant. School is not only for learning but also for helping students practice valuable life skills. As most students think that school is just about learning, it is also teaching them important skills that they need to know later in life. Therefore, having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a good idea because it helps students work on important skills such as collaboration, creativity, and hard working.

Collaboration I think is the most important skill to have to know on this list. Not only will you have to know how to talk properly at work, you will also need to know how to talk properly anywhere you go. That is why the more you talk to people in a group the more you help your collaboration skills. Collaboration doesn't always have to be oral. It can be done when texting someone. Make sure you think before you speak also that is on where everyone has trouble on, even adults.

Creativity can be good be bad. It can be good if your on a sports team and your need to make an exciting play. Creativity can also be found in artwork. Only the most beautiful artwork is fond from a creative artists. Now the reason creativity can be bad is if you take the lazy way out. By that I mean, say John's mom tells him to take out the trash but he don't feel like doing it, he then realizes that the trash can was left open. He decide to shoot the trash like it's a basketball in the trash. John then misses and he is left with a pile of trash to clean up. That is how creativity can be bad.

A hard working person is a person who he/she puts effort into something to get it done. The more someone says they can't, the more they're telling their brain to just give up. But the more they tell themselves they can then they can do it. Just think of Jason Pierre Paul. He plays for the Philadelphia Eagles. When he lost his arm as a young boy he though he would never be able to play in the NFL with his brother. But he didn't quit and he showed the world how much effort he put into wanting to play in the NFL. He went on to win best defenses man of the year award. All because of his hard work.

In conclusion having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity such as sports is a great way to help students practice their collaboration skills, creativity skills, and hardworking skills. Every body needs to start learning these skills at a young age. So they can grow up to be a civilized human being. All we need is some modern civilized people. If we had them this world would be a better place to live in.                                    ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
AF5E5BF38512,"Have you ever been forced to do something you might not always want to by a parent or a teacher, such as an after school activity? Many students are pressured to sign up for sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities by parents, friends, and teachers. This ensures that they are getting physical activity, time off electronics, and are spending time with their community. However, students should not be forced to participate in these extracurricular activities because of their homework and jobs, lack of time spent with their families and friends, and the money some families do not have to pay for these activities.

Students' lives are almost always busy, and many rarely have a chance to relax. First, they have to spend eight hours of their day in school, only to go home and do two hours of homework. After that homework, many students go work jobs to save for college or build a resume. Even after that job has ended, students go home and may have to help do chores around the house. Only after those fourteen hours of the day have flown by is the student allowed to finally get ready for bed, struggle to get their required eight hours of sleep, and wake up only to do it all again. With this crowded schedule, it would be near impossible to manage an after school activity that lasts about two hours on top of all that. Kids should be able to enjoy their childhood by hanging out with their friends and relaxing, not having to worry about how the yearbook is coming along, if the sports teams are doing well this season, and if the school has the budget for prom at the end of the year. Those are enrichment activities that people without as busy lives should be able to choose to partake in, not forced to.

People hear a lot that they should strive to spend quality time with their friends and family, to ensure they don't become a little hermit that lives in a secluded world of their own. On top of the already insane schedule many students maintain, there's very little time left for spending time with friends and loved ones. Many students miss out on going to the mall on weekends with their friends, going out on dates with their significant other, and laughing at movies with their parents and siblings because they're busy working, applying to colleges, or doing homework that a teacher assigned to them over the weekend. Forcing them to participate in extracurricular activities does not benefit the situation at all. On top of not being able to spend time with the people that mean most to them, they're being told to run laps at sports practices, waking up at dawn to get ready for the big game, taking pictures for the yearbook at events, or going to meetings with the other student government members to plan the school dance. This causes immense stress for students, and it also weakens the bonds and strains the relationships between students and their friends and family.

It's not exactly difficult to see the fact that many students' families struggle financially. Many times, the only time students ever get to eat is at school, and often don't have enough money for hygiene, clothes, or school supplies. If these students are forced to participate in these after school activities, they may not be able to afford it; if they can, it often becomes even more of a struggle for the family, as that money could have been spent on paying the bills or food, rather than it being spent on sports uniforms and gas for cars that need to be driven to and back from practices, meetings, and events. Sports tend to be very expensive, with registration fees, uniforms, proper equipment, gas to drive the students places, and snacks to provide after school, as many students need to eat during practices. ninety percent of Americans are already in some sort of debt, whether it's student loans, house mortgage, cars, or just bad spending. Adding the cost of sports or other after school activities will drown students and their families in bills that they may not be able to pay off.

Although it is a good idea for students to participate in extracurricular activities, they should never be forced to because it impacts many students negatively because of their busy schedules, lack of time with their friends and loved ones, and because of the financial struggles many students' families face and may not be able to afford. Instead, students should be able to say whether they can and want to participate in these activities, or be able to not do extracurricular activities and be able to relax and spend their leisure time however they please.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
CC9DB5A93782,"Should students be required to attend extracurricular activities? Would this really help students and provide enjoyable experiences? While there are some good things that could come out of requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities, there are some downsides as well. Personally, I disagree with the decision to require all students to participate in the activities because some students may not enjoy doing extracurricular activities, or simply might not have any time to attend them. Extracurricular activities do give some students the opportunity to expand their knowledge in certain areas, spend time with friends, and maybe help them find their passion in life, but other students may not be as positively impacted in the same way as others.

So, there are the students who don't enjoy participating in extracurricular activities. There are many students who don't prefer to do these activities because perhaps they are socially awkward and would rather avoid social interaction. Maybe there just isn't an activity that is available to them that is of interest. Another reason is that they might enjoy doing something else that doesn't qualify as an extracurricular activity. It isn't right that the principal is forcing students to do something they don't want to do. Students should be able to choose what they want to do and how to spend their time. Some may learn how to enjoy an activity after joining one they were unsure about, but others may end up not enjoying the experience at all, therefore, giving them something not to look forward to that was forced upon them with the intention of a positive impact.

Other students may not like the decision that requires them to attend extracurricular activities, specifically activities held after school hours, because they already have plans, and being forced to attend activities would break in to their already-planned schedules. Scheduled plans such as family events; religious events; sporting events that don't directly involve the student; work hours for a job; or perhaps just time to finish schoolwork. All of these examples are things that students may not feel obligated to cancel, just so they can attend an activity that was forced upon them. There will obviously be some times when students are allowed to miss out on the extracurricular activities they are supposed to attend, but why give students a sense of worry about not being able to go to an event that they might feel very obligated to attend?

Once again, I disagree with the decision to force students for participate in extra curricular activities because some may not enjoy doing them, and others may not have time to attend them. The fact is, is that the principal should not be forcing students to attend extracurricular activities. The principal should be giving every student the opportunity to find one and attend one if they wish to, but never have it be mandatory that they do. Many students do enjoy attending extracurricular activities, but it is important to consider the few who don't when making a decision like this. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
95A6AB619F10,"Imagine a school where no student feels left out and everyone has a group of friends where they belong. The students are genuinely happy to be in school, are generally in a good mood, and are also doing well academically. This would be the result of all students participating in an extracurricular activity. An extracurricular activity is any activity that someone does outside of school, like sports, working on the yearbook committee, or serving on the student council. Our principal should require students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it will encourage students to make friends and develop new skills.

Requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities gives them the opportunity to make new friends. Anyone who has been a part of a team or club knows that when someone is a part of a group, they form friendships that can last. Additionally, students who were always too afraid to be themselves at school would have a second chance at doing so by buiding confidence. Having friends is important because friends can make a person happier overall and give them a sense of belonging. Making friends outside of school will also earn them more friends in school. Soon, the empty nearby seats at the lunch table will be occupied with people that a student met at one of their extracurricular activities. Some people may not be very social at school, but participating in an activity outside of school will give them the chance to speak up and form strong friendships.

Whether a student is interested in doing sports, cooking, or participating in an academic competition for their extracurricular activity, they will develop several important skills along the way. The most obvious skill they will develop: being able to do that particular activity. However, students will also develop leadership skills, collaboration skills, and many other skills that can be applied to tasks and activities that they will do in the future. For example, one extracurricular activity that I participate in is dance. Dance has taught me how to work well in a team because I have to work with the other girls in my group to create unified movements. Dance has also taught me leadership skills and teaching skills because I often teach dance classes for the students at a lower level. I have the responsibility of deciding what they need to accomplish that day, and then executing it. Like dance, extracurricular activities can teach students important skills, that will benefit them in school and in the future.

In the end, requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity will only benefit them by giving them the opportunity to make new friends and develop important skills. If someone is marked as the ""shy kid"" at school and doesn't have friends, participating in an extracurricular activity will build their confidence to speak up and make friends. Extracurricular activities can also teach students important life lessons and give them skills that will improve their work and relations in school and in the future. All in all, requiring students to take extracurricular activities is a decision that at first glance seems terrible because it takes away the students' freedom, but in reality, it will have many positive effects on their lives.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
5EB03D5E79DC,"""UGH,"" groaned Generic_Name. ""What happened?"" asked Generic_Name ""I have nothing to do after school,""

said Generic_Name. ""Don't you have any clubs or sports after school,"" said Generic_Name. ""Nope,"" said Generic_Name. ""Well do you have any homework?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Maybe..."" said Generic_Name. ""So you have homework,"" said Generic_Name. ""Fine! I have a lot of homework, but I don't want to do any of it,"" said Generic_Name. ""You know, you could always join the homework club,""said Generic_Name. ""Whats that?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Its an after school club where you finish your homework, missing assignments and more,"" said Generic_Name. ""That seems like it could help me a lot. I guess I'll try it out,"" said Generic_Name. The benefits of joining the homework club are being more cooperative in class, finishing any homework, and helping other students.

Firstly, Students would be more cooperative in class. They would be more cooperative because they are finishing their work in the homework club. They would more likely understand whats going on in class, because they got help on what they were confused on. For Example, My best friend Generic_Name just started going to the homework club. Ever since she started going, Shes been more focused/cooperative in class. The club helped her become more engaged in class. For Instance, My cousin never focused well in class, so he went to homework club. Now he is more cooperative in class because he understands the things he was confused about. The club helped him understand better, and when he understood better, he become more focused in class.

Next, Students would finish their homework. Sometimes students might have a lot of homework or missing assignments, so they procrastinate and don't finish their work. By not finishing their work, their grades start to decrease. For Example, I procrastinate a lot because of the amount of homework or assignments I get. I started homework club a month ago, and I have been finishing all of my homework and assignments. I started to procrastinate less. Another Example, My friend Generic_Name never did her homework. Her grades are were really bad, so she joined the club and now she is carefree. She is carefree because she finishes her work in the homework club and she doesn't have to worry about it.

Finally, Students can help other students. They can help because they might have already learned the same thing as the other student and might help them understand it better. For Example, When I was at homework club, a girl two years younger than me needed help with her math homework. She didn't understand her homework, so I helped her because I understood the homework. Helping people with the things they are confused in makes you a leader. It makes you a leader, because you are the person guiding them through. For Instance, My friend Generic_Name didn't know what to do in her project, so her classmate that went to homework club with her, helped her with the project. He knew how to do the project, so he helped her. Helping other people could also help you with your social skills because you are communicating with other students. You are communicating with the other person and helping them, which plays a role in your social skills, especially in the future when you have a job.

""OMG!"" exclaimed Generic_Name, ""I can't believe it!"". ""What Happened?"" asked Generic_Name. ""I have an A+ in all my classes!"" said Generic_Name. ""Congratulations!"" said Generic_Name. ""Thank you! It took a lot of hard work and patience,"" said Generic_Name. ""Really, what did you do?"" asked Generic_Name. ""Well I joined the homework club like you said,"" said Generic_Name. ""Thats wonderful,"" said Generic_Name. ""I finished my homework, missing assignments, and I understand the things I was confused in,"" said Generic_Name. ""Thats cool,"" said Generic_Name. ""I met a lot of new people there, and I helped them to,"" said Generic_Name. ""I also stopped procrastinating like I used to. I learned this cool trick on how to stop procrastinating,"" said Generic_Name proudly. ""I'm so happy for you!"" said Generic_Name. Being more cooperative in class,finishing any missing assignments, and helping other students are all benefits of joining the homework club. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

sports,sports can help you receive stress and take your mind off of what ever thats you have to worry about at school. you have more responsibilities to take care of because your more focused about the the sport then whats going on at school. more students are stressed about school then anything else. sports or anything other extracurricular activity may take the stress away from school or from any type of stress. also having extracurricular activities have a part thats bad about it. being to focused on the sport may bring your grades down. having two types or responsibilities. you have to get homework done and you have sports to focus on if your going to do any extracurricular activities make sure you have a plan to get everything done in the time you have.

Student counseling helping any student with the problems that they have and sort things out. Is a good idea as that the student knows how life is different and know how things are. It can help a lot of students and more comfortable with them cause they might be friends. they are going to be comfortable with their friend talking to about the problem . They also may make things worse if there not professional and what their doing, It might make the situation worse if they say anything bad about it or they might just not like it. also that its an extracurricular activity

having all these extracurricular activities could change things for people to be out there and communicating with other students. help them relief stress from all the work that is due and focus on the extracurricular activity that they are doing. when they are back to school they are less stressed and ready to focus in class. looking forward to making new friends when other people join and can trust them. having a sport a year book club or anything you cant always focus on the sport or club, you have to focus on school and in the sport or club.

Imagine bein a student you have homework, chores and if you have little siblings you might have to watch them. Your stressed, overworked and pressured to do better. It is time comsuming and you have little relaxation now with this new rule you have even more to do. Your being forced to take up a club. Keeping that in mind do you really think its good to force student to take up a club with all of their prexisting responsibillitys? If your not convinced think aout what kind of clubs you have. Do you think each student, each indivdual will like your limted choces?

Students have countless tasks with homework, chores and taking care of siblings. Students do not get much time for themselves. With so little time to relax they become overworked and stressed which is bad for productivity taking up a club gives them even less time to relax. Student grades can and probibly will sufer with this kind of change.

Although many schools have all sorts of diffrent clubs with such a wide and diverse student population it can be hard to please them all. No doubt you will have students whos intrests do not line up with the clubs you have makeing them to join a club they dislike insted. Imagine all of your clubs are sports related with socer, baseball, football, basketball, track, ect and you have a student who hates sports you can not make an exeption to the rule so what do you do? The only choice there can be is to make the student take up something they hate which can cause acting out from the student as they try to get out of the club.

Now some may argue saying schools have enough clubs to satisfy everyone. This may be true but I would imagine you have over one hundred students or even with just one hunded students you would be pushing the limit of how many students one techer can watch not to mention the teacher dose not get paid to watch students after school. They may also have children of their own they need to take care of. Another posible arguement is that a club builds confidence and I would agree but students could very well dislike being told to do an activity and if they dislike it alredy it will not end well.

Clubs are fun and enriching but should never be forced onto someone. Now I have given my side I pose the qusetion to you, do you still think its a good idea to force a club on students? My answer is no and I hope yours is the same. This rule is only going to do more harm than good.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
EC8040CEB1E1,"Although extracurricular activities are great they should not be mandatory. Sports and clubs can be wonderful, but there is always a downside. Some children just don't have time. That is why I disagree with the principal because not all kids can do extracurricular activities.

Children just don't have time for extra things in their lives. Some children don't get home until very late at night because their parents work late. It's not their faults, but making extracurricular's mandatory is putting more stress on parents too. When some students get home they have hours of homework to do. Homework can make you stay up extremely late and that can make you tired for school the next day.

A lot of students have extra work around the house that they have to do when they get home. Some students have to do chores that take hours. Students have to cook dinner,clean, and babysit. Doing chores,homework,and a extracurricular activity would be too much stress for a child. If the children had to do all of that they would never end up going to bed!

There are some students who don't work well in groups. Forcing that on them would just make them feel worse. Some children have horrible anxiety and working in groups can make them afraid. I know from experience that when children that suffer from anxiety have to do something they feel they can't they will have a panic attack. That is something that is very hard to deal with and when they go into that state you can't get them out, you just have to comfort them. That is why I personally think you shouldn't force kids into activities.

Students need to be reassured that they have a choice because being forced into something is never enjoyable especially since we're teenagers. We don't like to listen and usually do the opposite of what we get told to do. Giving us the decision of if we want to do extracurricular activities or not will give us responsibility.

628D02AAB498,"Making all students participate in a extracurricular activity is a horrible idea! Some people might agree that all students should participate in a extracurricular activity but I disagree because not all students have the time to participate in activities at school. Some students have jobs, activities out side of school, and other responsibilities.

Let me start by saying making all students participate in a extracurricular activity in school is not a very bright idea! Some students have jobs and they might not have the time to participate in activities at school. For example, my oldest sister Generic_Name was on the cheer team and she also had a job but she had to quit the cheer team because her job hours and practice time was interfering.

Another reason I disagree with making all students participate in a extracurricular activity in school is because some students participate in activities out side of school. When they get home they have to get ready to go to practice so they wouldÃÂ´t have time to participate in a activity at school. Like when I was on the dance team and I wanted to do track but I couldnÃÂ´t because when I got home from school it was time for me to get ready for dance practice and track practice was at the same time as dance practice. This is why I disagree with making all students participate in a activity at school because not all students have the time.

Final reason why I disagree with this statement is because some students have responsibilities when they get home. They might have to get their younger sibling off the bus, babysit, or even clean the house. If they donÃÂ´t handel their responsibilities they might get in trouble or worst. One time my sister got in a lot of trouble because she was supposed to get me off the bus and she didnÃÂ´t because she stayed back for basketball.

In conclusion, making all students participate in a extracurricular activity at school is not a very bright idea. Some students have jobs, activities out side of school, and other responsibilities and are not able to participate in activities at school.

AE9E8ACD0A6F,"Does your school principal ever make you participate in after school activities?

If so, do you think it is fair? Well, I don't think it is fair, because, first of all, it takes away students' free time. After school programs not only take away free time, it also takes away time for students to do their homework and schoolwork. Secondly, if you have an upcoming test, and you don't have time to study if you want to get to bed at a decent hour, then you shouldn't have to do an after school program, otherwise, your activity should be canceled. Like, for instance, if you have an SOL the next day and you attend your after school activity because it wasn't called off, then you might not get the sleep you need for the test because you got home late, and couldn't study. It's good to have a fresh mind when you wake up in the morning, as well as a good breakfast.

If some students play sports, it will make them late for practices and games. Additionally, if you are a bit competitive and you play against someone during your activity, it could cause a lot more fights and even school suspension, if it goes too far. Students shouldn't be forced to do something that they don't want to do. Some students even like to go out to dinner with family and friends. Also, if they have lots of schoolwork to catch up on and their activity takes away their time to make it up, it can put pressure on students' when their work just piles up even more. For those reasons, after school activities should be eliminated for all schools. It can also take away students attention in class and cause them to lose focus, as well as, cause learning disabilities because they don't have the time to learn it in class. Stress can also cause students to want to miss school because they are overwhelmed with school work. If students don't want to participate, then don't force them.

After a long day at school, students like to go home and relax a while, but these after school programs that you are, supposedly required to attend to, take away that privilege. The schools need to realize how important free time is for students. Free time can also help with communication and interaction with friends. Students need to be aware of new responsibilities to prepare them for adult life. Growing up is hard to do and attending after school activities, only makes things harder because of the attention they are forced to put on their program. These reasons should be thought about and discussed before they decide on rather or not, after school activities is a good thing.          ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
29F5457E7E90,"Many people might think that taking part in extracurricular activities is a waste of time. However, it could be the one thing that can take people out into the world of different hobbies and opportunities. Extracurricular activities can be greatly beneficial in so many ways. For example, students can explore different hobbies that may be of interest to them and students can make lots of new friends as well. Students also gain a lot of experience that they can carry over into their everyday lives; there really isn't a downside to participating in after school activities! Participating in extracurricular activities can be beneficial, for it will help students make new friends and learn new hobbies and skills.

Making new friends is only one of the positive outcomes of having students participate in after school activities. In this modern age you don't need facts and statistics to tell teachers and staff that many students these days are suffering from bullying, cyber bullying, and loneliness. There are lot's of kids out there that don't feel like they will ever fit in with the rest of the students. Although it may seem nice to blend in with everyone else, everyone is different in their own unique way. This should be celebrated and not ridiculed. Therefore, joining after school activities and making friends that have the same interest as you can really be beneficial. When a student joins a club or sport that appeals to them, they will inevitably be surrounded by other classmates that have the same interests as them. When people are around others that have the same interests it often leads to friendships.

Joining after school activities could also cut down on bullying, for students could worry more about their friendships rather than focusing on bullying somebody else which could be very beneficial for students. It could help them focus more on their new friends and school work rather than the bully that's waiting for them down the hall. Making new friends isn't the only positive outcome of participating in extracurricular activities. Learning about new hobbies and skills is another positive effect as well.

A wonderful result of joining extracurricular activities is that students can learn about new hobbies and skills. There are so many amazing hobbies and activities out there that many students haven't even heard of, and this is where after schools clubs and activities come into play. Students have the opportunity to learn about and experience vastly different subjects that they may not get the time to do elsewhere. Some clubs even teach students valuable lessons about how to cook healthy meals for themselves, appreciate different cultures around the globe, and even community service. All of these different clubs offer valuable lessons and skills that students can carry over into their everyday lives and even when they grow older. It's truly amazing what these clubs have to offer. In fact, another reason is that there may be students that come from lower class families that don't have the opportunity to participate in sports and other leisurely activities. With after school activities students can have the opportunity to experience all of those amazing activities without cost. Extracurricular activities can give students so many amazing experiences and skills that they can carry with them for the rest of their lives.

Extracurricular activities can be really beneficial for students, for students get to make new friends and learn about new hobbies and skills. Making friends can help students by making them feel more included and like they belong. Furthermore, it could also cut down on bullying in schools. Learning about different hobbies and skills is beneficial because it can teach students valuable lessons and expand their interests. In the end, extracurricular activities should be a requirement in all schools because of how beneficial they can be to students. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
A5DA0D5410DE,"My principal recently decided that all students should participate in an extra curricular activity, and I totally agree. I think every student should participate in an activity like sports, a musical in s trument class, or some sort of club. This would help students to learn and develop talents and skills. Also it would give students a time to socialize with people. So, I think the principals's idea was great and it helps students learn and grow and gives time to socialize.

If students do after schools activities like sports they will be able to exercise and practice coordination with friends. Sports will make students to grow to strong and get lots of sunlight. Learning an instrument has been proven to make people smarter. But not just in music, in other curriculum too. Also there is a lot of different clubs out there that can help people with getting jobs or just learn a hobbie too.

One big thing that I will really like about this is that it gives students more time to socialize mwith friends. This will also give practice of big social skills you will use through your life. These skill will help get jobs for students later in their life. With an extra hour or two to spend time with peers and teachers they will get alot of practice. But most of all give students a fun time after spending all their day at school.

So in conclusion, the principals decision on students participating in extra curricular activities would good for me and my peers. It will give students time to develop and grow their skills, like coordination, knowledge of a topic or hobbies. Also it would give students time to socialize, grow social skills and have fun.

B1D7630EE532,"I like this idea a lot. It would be a good way for students to make new friends and find an activity that they enjoy. Some students might not like it because it would take time away from doing other things. Even though kids should already be doing activities or sports. A lot of kids will just sit around and watch Netflix after school. This will give them a chance to find something they like to do that is more active. I think that parents would be happy that there child is getting more involved and having fun.

Some people struggle to pay for things like this. So if anyone could give a little extra money for those kids then the teams would be bigger and better. The principle could even make the activities cost little to nothing so that every student could be doing something. If a student isn't participating in a sport then the cost might go up or down, it depends on what they decide.

This could help them in the future like when college's start looking for students. They want students who get involved with things at school and who try there best.

70ED039EAD61,"Students these days lack extracurricular activity. Mainly kids focus on their main core classes that only serve in those seven hours of school. In my opinion I agree that the school should provide a variety of athletic and academic activities at or after school. I would highly recommend this to all schools. Not only should students be as smart as they are, but that students should have the ability to choose at least one activity that they would love to do.

Everyone expresses themselves in different ways which make them who they are. If my principal ever gave this opportunity to my school then I would be thankful. Since not only can kids be book smart but participating in an extracurricular activity gives them wonderful things to come their way. These activities the school would provide students would give them an extra activity that makes them who they are today. Students by all means deserve this so they can express themselves to other people and make an impact.

I believe every student would wish to just come home from school and lay in bed while they watch TV or play on their phone. This should not be the case although this situation happens everyday.

Instead of looking forward to watching your favorite show when you get home from school look forward to something totally different. People are getting more and more lazy and I'm sure the school could agree as well. Providing these extra activities will prevent students from being lazy which would help themselves.

When students participate in these activities it not only helps themselves but different schools and colleges look at that in your applications. You might not realize by doing these activities provided for you help you in the long run. Colleges in different states look for this and are amazed by seeing the things you do in your everyday life. Doing these sports and academic activities that you love doing can even give you a job all about the certain things you love doing everyday. For example my extracurricular activity outside of school is lacrosse which definitely made a gigantic impact on my life and I absolutely adore lacrosse and want to continue doing it in college. Which gives you an example from what you love in life brings you great things in the future.

All students schools should be able to have the chance to express themselves in any way possible. If schools make this decision all staff will get to see a hue change in the students. It is just an overall great and smart decision that schools need to make.

2FA8056C7201,"Dear Principal of Generic_School,

Recently, you have stated that you will be enforcing a radical and possibly illegal new policy. This new policy will force every student to attend and participate in extracurricular activities. I would urge you to reconsider, here are a few reasons why.

Many of our students that attend this school work jobs. You realistically cannot expect high school students to quit their jobs and stop making income. Especially when that income goes toward paying for college, helping their parents make rent, and supporting their families. Jobs help shape and mold young people, as it is a vital experience that makes them ready for an occupation. However, if you do choose to enforce this policy, many local businesses will suffer from unemployment.

Another reason I am against this policy is that you are forcing students to do something that isn't required. After school programs are a great thing to students who are interested, but not to those who aren't. When you make someone do something against their will, the cons out weigh the pros. Those who aren't willing to learn, won't. As someone who has worked in the public school system, you must know this. You could make the argument that it's practically an extension of school, but it isn't. You cannot legally make students stay after 3:15, nor can you make teachers stay after 3:45. If you enforce this policy, it will only be a matter of time until upset parents will press charges against the school for illegally obtaining children.

The biggest reason why this policy would not be viable, is our budget. As many of us students know, our school system is not in a safe financial state. We are already on a tight budget, and expanding our extracurricular programs to serve around 400 more people doesn't make sense. Especially now, when we are spending thousands of dollars to prepare for a global pandemic that has already brought many schools around us to their knees. It is clearly not the time to waste our money on something we would possibly get sued for enforcing, instead of spending it on something we need.

This letter contains just a few reasons why I am against it. From unemployment to the legality, I hope I have changed your mind on this subject. And if not, I would surely wish you would be open to compromise.

C7373B980F7E,"Why call it extracurricular when you are required to do it? I disagree that you have to stay after school because what if you have a job,parents are divorced ,have no time to chill with friends, and if you have to walk home with your siblings.

What if you have a job then you would not be able to sat after. The reason why you can't stay after is if you have a job you have to get ready, you have to take a shower. You might even have to do choirs if your parents give you some when you come home from school then you have to leave for work and on top of that you might have to do homework.

What if your parents are divorced. If your parents are divorced then then you might not be able to see your mom and your dad as much. Without being able to see your parents as much that will leave you and your parents depressed do to the mental health problems that occurs when your parents divorce.

If you are required to stay after school then you wont have as much time to hang out with your friends. When you are at school for so long you get anxious because all you are doing is traveling to room to room all day then they add even more time to the day its just bound to have more frequent fights. But not only that you dont get to see your friends as much because by the time you are getting home its becoming dark outside.

When you have to stay after you can't walk your siblings to your house. The nice thing about getting off ealer then the elementary school kids is when you get out of school you can walk to there school then wait for your siblings. But if you are required to stay after school then you cant walk them to the house which would mean that they would walk by them self or a parent would have to quit there job to make sure there child gets home safely.

In conclusion, You should not make it required to stay after school because we might have a job,parents that are divorced,wont have much time to chill, and our siblings might have to walk there house by them self. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
B42AFC74C063,"Students should be allowed to make their own decisions and to not be forced into doing any activities others choose for them or make them do. If they are unable to cooperate physically and/or don't have the right type of mindset they should not participate. Not having that compatibility with certain subjects that others may have might be challenging for others to look forward to. It would be enticing to do these events but if you don't have many ideas for these things, it's disappointing. People would really look forward to those plans but when you lack skills it is hard.

Sports festivals will need pros who can win in any games or peoples they face up against. In ""Work on the yearbook"" section you will need skills of editing, drawing arts and photography. Last for student council you will need lots of ideas and ways to help the community and plan events. For those events and activities people will need time to do so, If you are unable to have that time nor someone to pick you up from those things then it's harsh to find someone who is willing to do so. You will need a family member or a close friend who can drive because these events may carry on longer then school buses can manage to take you home.

These activities that you may force on us may be a good thing in your head and to some other people but when you come back to reality there's a bigger picture. All these plans you want us to have to do is very tiring and time consuming, many people may not have the capabilities to do so. Finding the right time, ideas and perfectly cut out people for the job is extremely hard. This may not be as easy as it seams especially for the young and maturing as they're still trying to figure out paths they want to go down for the future, and how their brains are still developing. Students shouldn't have to participte if they are not willing to. Leave the choice up to them. ",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
EB793B72A8C4,"Extracurricular activities are important for students, and I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students should try something new instead of doing nothing. Students can gain a lot from this experience, so I believe that they should participate in them. I think that even if students don't want to participate in these activities, they should because they can learn things that they never knew before, and I think that it could make an impact on their lives. Extracurricular activities are good for students to participate in because they can give you something to do, they can help you meet and befriend new people, and they can help kids find potential ideas and hobbies.

Extracurricular activities can give you something to do. Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people.

Extracurricular activities are a good way to socialize with people because you are participating in activities and games that you enjoy with other people. You share the same interests, and liking the same things as someone else is a good way to bond and socialize with people. I met a lot of people through after-school volleyball, and I am still friends with most of them to this day. Our team would go out to restaurants after our games whether we won or lost because we were friends, and we liked to play together. We all liked playing the sport, so it was easy to make friends with each other. I also met a lot of people through my art club because we liked to draw, and we liked to talk to each other. If you have trouble making friends, you will most likely be able to socialize and bond with others through these events. I met one of my best friends through after-school dance classes when I was in elementary school. We enjoy dancing and listening to music together. Not only are extracurricular activities able to help you get to know people, but they can also help you find your interests.

Having schools require students to take at least one extracurricular activity can help them find hobbies, and they can help students find things that they didn't know they were interested in. For example, I once convinced my sister to play volleyball. She didn't really want to do it. After school that day, she came to our volleyball practice. She ended up loving the sport, and she also plays it to this day. There are many different activities, such as theater, art, sports, science and math clubs, and the student council. Students are most likely going to find an activity they like and stick with it as they get older. Doing an activity that you enjoy can be very entertaining, and you might keep doing it in the future. I am in my school's eighth grade chorus, and I want to continue this activity as I get into high school. If you really enjoy these activities at school, you might also try to practice them at home. If you like to go to an art club at your school, you might continue to draw at home. These activities can also lead to trying to improve in your hobby as well. I continue to draw at home so I can improve. Schools give access to these potential new hobbies and activities, and I think that students should go to them and give them a chance.

In conclusion, I believe that students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity. It is something that I believe is crucial to who students grow up to be. If students join an after-school activity, they can become more responsible. Having them sit around all day can make that person lazy in the future. They not might want to try new things in the future because they were raised that way. Giving kids these potential interests can help impact their choices in life, such as what they want to do for a job or what they want to do for a hobby. People might already have their future planned, but joining an extracurricular activity can change their views and can give them new ideas. Overall, I think that extracurricular activities are a good way for students and kids to spend their time participating in and enjoying. ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
25FCAC7AE925,"I personally think every kid should do some sort of extracurricular activity,for one the activities could help them find new friends,they can look good on college resumes,and all around make the persons' school experience better. The first reason is that extracurricular activities can help students find new friends. This is what happens normally when playing sports,because everyone playing that sport has to play as a team. The next example is that participating in an extracurricular activity can look good on college resumes. If you play a sport or are in a club and stay committed to it, that is what colleges look for. The last example is the activities someone takes part in,can help them through the rest of the year. Clubs or participating on school council can make your year more interesting,because you almost always have something to look forward to.

The first part of my examples I want to talk about, is that the activity you pick can possibly assist you in finding a new friend. For instance if you play a sport,then that means you play with at least 10 other people. Therefore you will have to work as a team,or else you guys wouldn't win much. That is why there is practices,because the coaches are trying to get you and your teammates used to playing alongside each other. You start to know each other better and better as the season goes on and by the end of the year,a person you played with could become a close friend. Another example would be if you are in a school club, you will work along side others which could spark a friendship down the line. This is also the case when you are on student council you work with others for a lot of if not the whole year. Besides those examples there are so many more extracurricular activities that could help you find new friends. That was multiple reasons how you could make new friends during extracurricular activities.

The second point I have stated could be the most important in someone's life,the example is that if you participate in any sort of activity for your school would look good on your college resume. This is a great example of why you should do extracurricular things in school, and stay committed with it. For example if you play football for your whole high school and middle school career and stay with it,in turn colleges will see that you were physically and mentally committed to something and possibly could accept you. Therefore if there are bigger colleges wanting to accept you,where if you graduate it could turn into a very good paying job,you have a great future ahead of you. Those were just a few of my reasonings why extracurricular activities would look good on college resumes.

The third and final example of why you should do extra activities for your school is it can make your whole school experience better. Specifically in sports when you have a game on a school day. When you get to the school in the morning on game day it goes by really quick,because you have something you are looking forward to do. This can also happen when you have a club party,fundraisers,or any special event for your club or sport. In any instance you are looking forward to having fun out of school with your classmates/club members or your teammates. That is also another great place to make friends whether its a chill hang out with your teammates or it is a special event for your club you still can make friends in either situation,which could lead to you and your new friend to hang out more in school, that would also make the school day more enjoyable. Those were my reasons why people should do activities so it could make them like school more.

People should participate in extracurricular activities because they can,make new friends,have a good college resume,and make school a lot more enjoyable. The first reason is so they can make new friends,which this happens in any kind of activity you do. The second is it would look good on a college resume,more clubs you join the more colleges look at you. The third and final reason is so it can make school more fun and enjoyable,it can be because you made a new friend or if you are waiting on a special event. The whole idea of school is to set yourself up for success and joining clubs,doing sports or any other activity can help you in doing that. Granted you might not make it in the best college but at least you won't regret doing the extracurricular activities you did and had fun doing them.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
1C29F0363194,"Are you passionate about chess, football, or debate? Luckily, most schools have clubs for those activities. Extracurricular activities are very helpful in the success and improvement of students. All students should be required to do one or more extracurricular activities. When doing and extracurricular activity, students can learn new skills, meet new people, and grow awareness for a cause, issue, or group.

Students want to learn about things outside of what they're testing for, and extracurricular activities are the perfect opportunity to do that. There are activities where you can learn to bake, sew, play chess, play basketball, or even learn about other countries and cultures. Students should be required to learn skills outside of History, English, Math, or Science. Students should have more opportunities to learn about life outside of those subjects. Adults might not use polynomials or graphs every day, but they most likely cook every day, so students should have an opportunity to learn how to cook.

Another reason extracurricular activities should be required because you can meet new people. When I first moved to Virginia I didn't know anyone, I was scared and didn't have any friends. By doing extracurricular activities, I found a great group of friends that are passionate about the same things I am. One of my friends recently tried out for our school play, she got in, and now she is much closer with everyone involved in the play. After spending many weekends and days after school in the drama department, she made many new friends and grew closer with old friends too.

Extracurricular activities also grow awareness for illnesses or groups. If it weren't for fundraisers, I wouldn't know about illnesses like ovarian cancer, or dementia. Many schools also have a diversity club where students can raise awareness about different cultures and embrace their differences. Diversity club can ensure people that it's okay to be different and that no one is the exact same. Through the partners program at my school, I learned that special needs people are still people and that you should treat them with the same respect you would give anyone else.

All in all, Some people think that we shouldn't be required to do an extracurricular activity, but I disagree. I think that all students should be required to do at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities teach students new skills, like chess, help students make new friends, and grow awareness for many issues. You can contact your principle, via email or call him/her, and tell him/her that extracurricular activities should be a requirement. Extracurricular activities are important, and help not only me, but others improve as well.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
07AB5218B889,"Would you believe that my principal, the proud representative of Generic_School Middle School is choosing to force students to stay after school for no less than one activities regardless of my or any other kids feelings? Sadly you would have to believe me because that is the truth. Instead of implementing a beneficial policy to school grounds our principal choose to take away students freedoms. I know for a fact that other students feel the way I do. I believe that this is a complete mistake making this decision because, it adds to the mountains of stress students already receive, it will conflict with students interests, and the idea that this is forced upon students is something that will not make us proud or happy to go to Generic_School.

One of the major reasons why this is a terrible policy is the amount of stress that participating in an extracurricular will add. Students already have large amounts of stress due to balancing homework, projects, studying for tests, S.O.L's, and getting enough sleep every night. Also, if students stay after for a club there interested in there is no guarantee everyone in that group is as nice as you. Teens can be major jerks and sometimes can put you in an bad situation. I wouldnt want to be forced to stay after school in an unsafe and uncomfortable environment. I have stayed after school many times and it has not been enjoyable, theres always at least one kid that has an issue with everyone that looks at him/her. A mandatory policy like this increases the number of opportunities for bullying to ac cure. I wouldnt want to be forced to stay after school in an unsafe and uncomfortable environment.

Another crucial reason why this policy should not be instated is the conflict with students interests, outside of school, it will have. Students have many interests outside of school, if another activity were to be forced onto them it would affect there current schedules massively. I am currently participating in four activities outside of school, an additional one would through me off completely. A lot of kids including myself have a bit of a routine on a daily basis, this policy will mess up my routine. Also, what if there are know clubs/activities that a student is interested in?. Are they supposed to just tough it out and waste two hours their time doing something they dont enjoy. After school programs last from 2:30 to 4:30. Sometimes I get dropped off at my stop at 6:30 and in the winter its dark out by then. That leaves me maybe an hour of homework if i'm lucky, because I most likely already have something going on. As it is the school grading system is unfair, because if someones writing is truly brilliant but they did not follow the rubric the will get an F, While somebody whos writing is very dull and boring will get an A. The last thing students need is less time to do schoolwork.

My third and final point on why this policy is a big mistake is the fact that this is forced upon us. If theres one thing Teenagers dont like its got to be rules that limit what they can do. It is nice having the option to stay after, I would not to be forced to do so. A policy that has been instated at Generic_School is the phone policy. It states that kids mayn not be on there mobile device at all during the school day, this has increased the number of students using there phones, even more people than before the policy. The reason why teens shoplift is because its taboo, there forced to not steal, so they then steal. A country in south America is experimenting with a new law were cocaine is legal. It has actually decreased the amount of people using it, by making it legal it gave people less pf a reason to do it. My point is that if students were forced to stay after it would cause rebellion and protest and negative attitudes among the students.

In conclusion, A policy that forces students to participate in at least one extracurricular is a tremendous mistake because it will negatively impact students by adding to there stress, conflicting with there interests outside of school, and forcing this upon them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
2E810318FBD2,"Your principal has decided that all student's must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I do agree that student's should at least do one activity like help work on the year book's, sports,student council, etc. If i had to pick one activity it would be student council because i can help people like if their going through tough times. Say if they have trouble in school, try to help them with there grade's, or maybe the lost a love one. I would convince other to support me because i listen to people about what wrong or if there going thought something. I care about people feelings and i won't say anything in till there done.

Why do i want to do this is because say if your mom,dad,granddad, or grandma die in a car crush wouldn you be upset because that's your family member or maybe they die of the corona would you be upset you would want a councilor, brother, or sister. What i'm trying to say is that people need a council to help them out. Ok say that a truck smash your house wouldn't you be in shock in that case you would need a council right.

What i trying to say is that i want people to support me to do what i want to do, like say i want to help people out through family problem or like a love one die of cancer, heart attack, car crush, etc. I would be there to help them through there problem. it would be my honor to help people out.

C0AF81E21678,"Would students rather be sitting at home doing nothing or would they rather be doing something fun at school? Well the principal has decided to make everyone at Generic_School participate in an extracurricular activity. I agree with this decision; students shouldn't be sitting doing nothing they should be out having fun. I think this because an activity would be a great way for children to meet friends and find something they are interested in.

Participating in an activity might help kids make new friends. Kids might not have many friends at school; therefore, if they went to an activity they could meet some new people. Last year in seventh grade I didn't have many friends. My best friend moved and I was going to a new school with a lot more people. One of my friends at school said they were signing up to be in Best Buddies; so I decided to sign up too. We became close to one of the buddies and now we all are friends do stuff outside of school. Also, children might not have any of their friends in their classes. Generic_School is very big and has many class rooms. The chance of get in a class with a friend is low. Last summer I was very nervous about not having any classes with friends. When school started I only had one class with a friend, but we didn't even get to sit next to each other. I didn't get to spend time with my friends until after school at Best Buddies. During that time I also made a new friend. Another reason is because kids might be shy and not able make friends during the day. I have always been a shy kid and when I didn't have any classes with my friends I kept to myself even more. Best Buddies gave me a chance to have fun and interact with more people. This year I still go to Best Buddies, and I am still good friends with the people I meet last year. Making friends can be hard at times, but going to an extracurricular activity could help.

Going to an extracurricular activity could help a student find something they are interested in. The activity they choose might be something they could do in high school. For example, when Generic_School's eighth graders went to visit the high school; they had a bunch of tables around the gym. At each table there were teenagers showing all of the extracurricular activities they had there. I signed up for Best Buddies because I really enjoyed it this year and last year. Also, the activity that a student picks might influence their decision on what they want to do when the grow up. For instance, I had always wanted to be a doctor when I grow up, but going to Best Buddies slightly changed my mind. Spending time with all the kids at Best Buddies, and helping them made me want to change what I wanted to be. Instead of being just a regular doctor, I now want to be a doctor for kids. Last, but not least, a student might like an activity so much that they want to do it outside of school. I enjoyed Best Buddies so much last year that I did it again this year! Last year my friend and I went to the movies to go see

""The Lion King""

with our buddy on the weekend. I also invited him to my birthday party and he invited me to his. Participating in an activity might help a child find a hobby or even something they would like to do in the future.

Overall, I support the principals decision, and think that everyone at school should be in an extracurricular activity. Not only can an activity help a student meet a new friend, they could also find something they are interested in. Instead of kids being board at home, they could be at an extracurricular activity having fun!  ",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
19FDE7E48C74,"Extracurricular activities are a way for students to express their interests, build relationships with their peers, and be active in their school community. Unfortunately, the school day and homework take up a large portion of the day, and not all students have the time or energy to participate in optional activities. There might be pressure from people at home or at school to preform well in a specific activity, or the school might not offer a program that fits the interests or needs of a student. Even though downsides are apparent, is there enough positive aspects to extracurricular activities that they should be required?

At Generic_School, there is a wide variety of activities and clubs offered for students from grades seven through twelve. Many students are able to find a club that they enjoy, and make attending that activity a part of their weekly routine. However, there are some students who just can't find the right club for them, or don't have the motivation. Sometimes they are busy with other activities outside of school such as sports or practicing a hobby, and they can't find any room in their schedule for more activities. Requiring everybody to participate in extracurricular activities would give some students the motivation they need to find a club that they really enjoy, but it could also force others to give up an aspect of their routine at home so they could have time to participate in activities at school. This would be especially devastating to a student who is training hard to become an athlete, or practicing a hobby they really enjoy, because they would have to give that up to choose from a variety of activities that they may have no interest in participating in.

Extracurricular activities can be very productive and enjoyable for any student, but only in the right setting. When a student decides that they want to commit to a club, they are more likely to work hard and enjoy themselves while participating. A student whose parent or principal tells them they must participate won't enjoy themselves, and will probably make the experience worse for everyone else around them. While an unmotivated student is wasting time in a club, they could be exploring an interest at home, or developing a skill set that one day could turn into their career. A student might select yearbook, but have no interest in journalism. A student could choose to participate in the student government, but not have any ideas for the school. While they aren't being productive, there could be another student who was denied a spot in their favorite program, all because someone who wasn't interested in the topic was required to sign up. Requiring extracurricular activities could take time away from productive activities elsewhere, and deny passionate students a chance at their dreams.

Students should all have a chance to be an active member of their school community, and have the freedom to choose what they participate in. Not everyone is aware the benefits of participating in extracurricular programs, and schools should make the student body aware of them, but they should not be required. Schools could encourage participation by offering a variety of activities, getting feedback from students on what needs to change, and advertising that extracurricular activities can be a fun way to meet new people, and learn more about a subject you're interested in. Providing students with a way to expand their knowledge and practice something they find interesting is a great way to inspire them to work hard. As soon as it becomes a requirement, students will begin to loose interest. Schools need to strongly encourage extracurricular activities, but not require them.               ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
AA9767FB71E9,"Think about the activities you participated in as a grade school student. This could have been sports, writing for the schools paper, or simply participating in the PTA meetings the county set up. Now some students choose not to participate in these activities, and it can set them up for failure farther into the future. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it encourages them to be more socially and physically active, and may help the students uncover new hobbies.

Participating in activities outside of school would help students build relationships and bond socially. Studies have shown that being more socially active is good for your body and mind; however some students aren't given the opportunity to become a social butterfly, and this can take a big toll on their life. When a student is anti-social they have an increased risk of sinking into depression, but participating in social activities from a young age outside of school can make it easier for students to make friends in the future.

It is important for students to get outside and exercise often, and playing sports outside of school is a great way to do so. Sports are examples of complex social activities, and they encourage students to be both physically and social active. Students can find a joy and passion for the sport they play, and when they do they begin to feel better about themselves.

Many students choose to enter journalism or creative writing, and some might discover that this is what they enjoy. Other students could enjoy rocketry or chemistry, and find that they enjoy that more than writing. This can all be accomplished by engaging in after school activities, that way the students could discover new hobbies that they might carry on through high school and college.

In conclusion, students who participate in extracurricular activities can find themselves entranced by new hobbies, learn to love a sport, and make friends easier. Students should always be encouraged to participate in after school activities to increase their emotional and social health. Given the chance, they could become the next big rocket scientist.",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
DA06C685218C,"I disagree with the principal beacuase no one should be forced to do anything that they dont want to to.

Students are sometimes lazy,so they dont want to do anything. so they just stay home and,play video games all day. when stay home all day all day everyday,that's how we as kids get over weight. on ther hand the principal can have his opinion. his opoinion wont matter because everyone has a choice.

what makes him think that he can fust force people to do stuff. no,no you can only control yourself. students have a good mind of there own. so students do what they think is best,and do what they want to do. students can follow the principals advice or dont follow his advice.

students ingeneral would love to have fun wile other's just want to eat and play video games. that's there choice like i said they have a great impact in life by what choices they make becuase it is hard sometimes. so dont let kids think that they can just do what you want them to do let them choose.

students get older and there mind is developing as they get older. so if the principal puts so much preasure on the kids he is also damageing there mind. and when i mean damageing i mean he is brainwashing there mind..now kids have a mind of ther own,some other's get brainwashed. when they get brainwashed they also lose there self,and they get out of control.

some kids have it hard in life,and i think it is wrong for the principal to put so much preasure on kids. for what beacuse he wants them to choose a sport,extracurricular activity. it should'nt matter if they da s activity or not they get to choose. you dont have to do activities if you dont want to. activities are just a thing that is extra.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent

Dear students of Generic_School , I think that the our principal Mr. Generic_Name should be enforcing that we participate in at least one extracurricular activity this year.

Participating in something that is fun and can help you with your everyday day to day life , we should strive to want . For example , there are people in Asia , Africa , and India that are not able to go to school and would die if they were able to do the fun things that we get to do , that is why we should want to participate in fun things that can benefit you and your community .

My pawpaw once said that , "" If a opertuntity is thrown at you catch that opertunuty and create new and better opertunitys , and we should be doing just that . People are getting mad at Mr. Generic_Name and are leaving rude messages to the school saying , ""my kid should not have to participate if they dont want to"" , but what they dont see is that Mr. Generic_Name is creating new opertuntiy for you and setting you up for life . participating in activities with the school is helping everybody out weather they see it or not , we are learning new things that will stick with you forever.

When I was in 6th grade at Generic_School ,I joined FFA and I was staying after one Friday were I met a girl named Generic_Name , she let me come into her group and be one of there friends and now we all are super close. That is why participating in activities at your school can be beneficial to you and other people around you . Doing things with your school can help everybody out . For instance look at me and that group of girls I met staying after school 2 years ago , we are all great friends and hang out all the time and if it was not for the school having activities who know the friend I would have .

I dont think that the principle should be able to make the students do an extracurricular activity that they dont want to do or like doing and if they dont want to they shouldnt have to maybe if they like doing student council, sports or working on the schools yearbook then they can.

One of the main reasons i say that students should be able to choose whether or not they do an extracurricular activity is because if the principle makes the student do an extracurricular activity that the student doesnt like and if there is some other students that actually want to do that activity what ever that might be it might be full of kids already so the kids that actually want to do that activity he or she cant do that now because the class might be full and there is a kid in there that doesnt even want to do the activitty he or she got put in.

Its just smarter in general because theres also the kids that will complain about anything and if u just let them choose what ever activity they want to be in they can thats if they even want to be in anything if not then they just dont do any sports, student council or working on the schools yearbook but i definetley dont think that the principle should be able to choose what u do in school just like u get to pick your classes most the time but if they are full then u get other choices.",2,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
57C5D1B5D26B,"What if out of the nowhere a person had to go out of their way to do something that wasn't needed? Wouldn't they be outraged and confused being forced into something that they know isn't necessary? So if this was implemented on a full scale of students wouldn't it fall apart completely. Knowing that the rule that would force students to do extracurricular activities could end up hurting the children and damaging the school, shouldn't it go away.

A school should support helping kids make their own decisions, but if they force them to make one it only hurts them and their growth. When someone constantly holds your hand and guides you to a choice it isn't possible to grow and learn. If they choose to hold their students hands throughout their schooling, how will they be able to grow and progress. If the children are forced into certain activities they won't be able to learn for themselves and become dependent on others. This can be shown in some schools were students pay others to write essay's for them but then fail their tests because nobody could help them. Also, it could ruin several students ability to manage their time if the principal forces them toward a activity. If a student who has a busy life gets more pressure on them they may give up on their grades. If they aren't able to manage their time on top of the activity, they won't be able to excel like how schools wants the students to. An example of this can be seen anywhere because if too much pressure is put on anyone they can get anxiety or depression from the stress. Lastly, it gives more stress on certain students because of the unfamiliar environment. If a child who is bad at interacting with others is forced to spend an upwards of 30 minutes or more a day alone with others it could make them anxious and scared. It would throw students into an unfamiliar place where they don't know anyone and don't even like the activity. This is shown in things like graduation or going to a new school, because teenagers may feel overwhelmed or stressed by the changes in environment. With all the damage the new rule would cause why let it stay in the education system.

It would change the school in many bad ways if this rule was allowed, which is why it can't be allowed to exist in our education. If the rule stays more money will have to go to clubs and activities then usually resulting in lower funds. A decrease in funds will happen since they need to buy more equipment for all clubs like volleyball. With more funds going to clubs it will be harder to improve the building itself and if any damage happens it may not be fixable. Which, is shown in modern capitalism where in order to expand you need to spend more money. Next, it will affect support given to the school. This will happen because if their kids are made to do something that affects them mentally in a bad way their parents will outrage. They would start losing students because the parents wouldn't support the school. This can be shown with things like the corona virus where people started to leave their countries after learning it was unsafe for their families. Last of all, it could affect the sponsors they get. This would happen because the school could start losing parents and kids which would affect how much money they get from sponsors and parents. Sponsors would leave because they no longer think that the school is worth their money since they are losing children and their parents. This can be shown in the stock market, where when funds are in a certain business and the value is going down the sponsors sell their stocks and leave. This would overall permanently damage the school if these events happened, which shows that this policy needs to be rid of.

It is only a waste to make that policy because it ends up hurting the kids and the school. There is no point in keeping this rule if it is just going to hurt everyone around it. So, if this school really cares about itself and its students it should let this activity law be abolished.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
0982F748C034,"I think that everybody should do at least one extracurricular activity, so that everybody has a chance to participate with the school. You don't have to do a certain one, you get to choose which one fits you best you, like you can play sports, you can write or draw, and so much more. Therefore, that means you can enjoy what you pick and not be interested in the activity. Some of these activities help you get into college because some college people come watch you work and see if your talented or not.

If you play sports, it may be hard out there because you have to stay fit you can't be lacking, You can play basketball if you like to shoot hoops at your house or if you just like the concept of it like how people work to together and more. Another sport is football, you may like how people are rough out there and going against each other. There is more but another sport is volleyball, girls can play sports like boys do, they can play softball, basketball, track, soccer and more. So you really have options of what you can do as sport and what you may like.

Some more things is writing and drawing, a lot of people love doing this activity. You may write the newspaper for the school and tell us what going on through out the day and week. Say if you like art you can make painting to show off your artistic part of you, and they might have contests for people to show off there work and college people may be there so o try your hardest. Therefore, that means they might do the same thing with writing, so its your chance to shine bright.

There is so much more you can do, it don't just have to just focus on them two activities, theirs clubs and stuff too. You can join the book club and thats where you read to kids, as a group, or by yourself. Theres an student council where you represent your classmates and come up with ideas for the school. Last but not least there is an drama club where you can express how you feeling by an character.

Basically what i'm saying is yes I do agree that we should have extracurricular activities in our school. It gives people chance to stand bright and show what they can do and what their good at. You have some many options to choose, so why will you just let that fly away. This is your ticket to greatness and to have and go career in the future and to make money. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
8BF8505849C8,"79% of student have a lot of stress because of school work. My friend, Generic_Name would cry to me because of how much school work he has, how unhappy he is, and how he needs a break. I think students should have an extracurricular we don't need to have 79% of student to be dealing with the stuff Generic_Name is dealing.

One of the reason I think student should have an extracurricular is to help calm stress. If a student does work all day then he or she will be stressed out of how much work they have to do, but if they have a class that they enjoy doing, and doesn't have to do work then they wouldn't be stressed out they would be stress free . Another reason why I think student should have an extracurricular activity is because more student would show up to school. For example, last year I would always hate odd days so much that I didn't even want to show up to school but there was this one class that kept me from staying home. It was art class I would just enjoy laughing with my friends, finger painting, and drawing people. If I didn't had that class I wouldn't even have shown up to school. I also think if student have an extracurricular they would come back to class all pump up and ready to do work. For example if I had an extracurricular and it was yoga or exercise then I would be ready to go to my class to do some work. They say when you do exercise it pump up blood and flow to your brain which makes them all ready to learn. My final reason why I think student should have an extracurricular activity is because student will have a positive attitude. Have you ever had a student come into your classroom all grumpy and grouchy? Well it's most likely because of the period they had before you. I know this because I am a student and I've been in their shoes before. One day I came home with a bad attitude and my parents would ask me why I'm acting bad I would tell them how bad my day was. There are some days that I came home all happy and jump because how amazing and fun my day was. Which is why we should have an extracurricular activity because our parents or teachers shouldn't have to deal with our bad attitude.

I think student should get an extracurricular activity because it will help a lot to lower students stress, it would help get students ready to learn, it would help student have a great attitude, and it will help student show up to school more. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
07A88E52FC70,"What if you were doing a extracurricular activity and wanted to share the joy of it with everyone else? I do agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Having a extracurricular activity helps students become more social, more active, and provides people with information that is not taught in school.

A extra curricular activity can allow people to become more sociable and make more friends. This is possible because there are probably other people who want to join the same clubs as other peers. People in the same club can then become friends with people that have the same interests that they do. For example, say you join a sports team. You must be able to work well with them in order to win games, therefore you must socialize with your other teammates and become friends with them.

Students can also become more active in exercising, school, the environment, and the community. Ways to become more active in exercising is by joining a sports team, in a sports team you exercise all the time in order to preform properly in your chosen sport. Students can become more active in school by joining the student council. When you join the student council you help organize events that can be seen as enjoyment for the other students, or it can help raise money for other school activities. Next, students can have a better impact on the environment. To do this students can join the gardening club or a

GO GREEN

club, which helps the plants and animals near your school. Lastly, by joining an extracurricular club you can also help your community. For example by joining

NJHS

or girl/boy scouts. These two clubs have you do activities that help out in the community, like helping the elderly or bagging food for the homeless.

Lastly, joining a extracurricular activity can provide students with a more in depth look on subjects that they are interested in. Therefore, it is wise for students to join clubs for subjects that are not taught in depth in school. For example science, art, or writing. This can also help students figure out what they want to do with their future, and if different activities would interest them or not.

In my opinion, I do agree that every students should be required to do a extra curricular activity. Even though having a extracurricular activity can allow less time for homework, or can negatively effect you grades. A extracurricular activity can benefit students in many ways from them becoming more active in school and the community, making more friends that could last a life time, or the can provide students with a bigger outlook on activities that they want to pursue when they get older. Therefore, I still believe that having an extra curricular activity is beneficial to students, people just have to work a bit harder to maintain the grades that they need for school. ",4,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
7748A809ACFF,"Hi i'm Generic_Name and I hope you enjoy my essay. I disagree with this decision because I think its to hard on the students. I also think that this principal is to hard on the students.

One reason I disagree is to much stress. Because the kids already have more classes. And practicing out of school for this activity would be to hard considering they already have homework. And it would either shorten or make the day longer for the student's. And it might narrow down the students classes, if that happens then they probably wouldnt get everything done which would leave it for homework.

My second reason is to much practice and work out of school. So if you signed up for a sport then you would have to practice out of school to get better. Or if you signed up for art you would actually have to practice drawing. And if you do a extra activity and a instrument one of them would be practiced less. On top of all of that you have to study for classes out of school.

And my third and final reason is that the kids would be to tired. Because some kids have to do chores after school. And because they would have to practice and study. And if a kid is already doing a sport out of school they would have to go to that right after the extracurricular activity. And they would have to do homework.

In this essay I talked about how kids would be tired and how it would be to much stress. I also talked about how it would be to much practice out of school. I disagree with this decision because I think its to hard on the students.

63A908894771,"Participating in an activity isn't so bad and would help you. My reasons would make you participate and agree. I agree on participating in at least one extracurricular activity. First, it would help us be distracted in good things. Students wouldn't have time to be sad or depressed because they would be more focused on their activity. We would have less drama and less counselor visits. Kids wouldn't have time to think about drugs because their mind would be on sports, yearbook, or student council. In the end, it would help us be distracted in good things rather than bad things. Second, we would be learning other new things. For example, working on a yearbook helps you learn how to edit pictures and add effects to it. Sports make you learn how to be healthy and be in good shape. Student council would help you be more social. At last, you would be learning more other things from those activities. Lastly, less screen time. Our eyes would be healthy because some of these activities don't require phones or technology. We would be more motivated in watching a game than just playing our phones. Instead of talking to people online you would have them their in real life. All in all, we would have less screen time. In conclusion, participating in at least one extracurricular activity isn't so bad and would benefit you in many ways. Activities distract you in a good way. Your learning other things that school in general wouldn't teach you. Less screen time benefits your eyes. After your activities, you'll be a much better and healthier person.",3,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
571B29B60BDC,"Is it a good idea to force students to participate in an extracurricular activity? I do not believe so. There are many reasons why not to force after school activities. It is not necessary to force students into taking an extracurricular activity because: the student could already be participating in a non-school related activity, the student's family might not be able to afford the activity, and the student might be unable to handle the extra work.

A lot of students actively participate in activities after they leave school,that are mostly run by the school they attend. However some activities are run by separate organizations. An example is the Y.M.C.A. They have swim teams for both adults and children to take part in and enjoy. If every student had to do some sort of school regulated extracurricular activity, then practices, or competitions could be scheduled at the same time. That would most likely cause those students to drop out of an activity they had enjoyed, to attend a school activity that is mandatory.

School activities are not always free. Sadly many families cannot afford more than what they use to survive. Unless the school pays for all the expenses, the student's family could have a hard time getting what is needed for that activity. If the student were to serve on the student council, money may be needed to start fundraisers, or give extra supplies for an event they set up. With most sports, the gear has to be bought in order for the student to play. To try out a current physical is needed, and that costs money that the family might not have to spare. Then if the student did not make the team the money was wasted. If the gas money to transport the student was unavailable, then they could not go.

Making kids participate in extracurricular activities could make them more active, but the student could have enough work to handle as it is. There are very many students around the globe who are very stressed about school. Adding activities that they have to prepare for and worry about could just add to their torment. A hardworking honor student that gets three packets of homework every night, will not have time to practice for volleyball, or prepare a speech for their school's student council. Perhaps there is a student who does their best but is not excelled at learning. to understand and pass his classes he might have to take extra time on homework. Maybe he has a tutor that he goes to after school to help him with difficult subjects. That student would not have much time to do anything but work if he had three hours of baseball practice when he got home.

In conclusion, schools should not force students to participate in an after school activity. It would cause more damage than good. Schools should not have mandatory extracurricular activities because: many students are already in non-school based activities, the family of a student might not be able to afford the activity, and students are overwhelmed with work as it is.",5,Mandatory extracurricular activities,Independent
7D2794FBFEB4,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that you are contemplating on whether or not students should be required to perform acts of community service. As a former student, I believe that community service should be required by all middle school students. Today community service helps me greatly. With all of the stress of being ""Mother Nature"", it is very hard for me to clean and inspect each and every nook and cranny. My former friends OTHER_NAME, and OTHER_NAME make it harder and harder for this beautiful planet that we call Earth to survive.

Some people argue that students shouldn't be required to do complete acts of community service. They say that community service is for "" janitors"" and ""convicts"". I think that they are wrong! Those who are say nay to community service are just saying yes to global warming and pollution. Community service is not just an job for janitors and convicts, it is a deep statement of opinion. When you complete community service you're saying "" I believe in bettering my country, my planet, and my life.""

Another common argument you hear associated with community service is the time. It takes to much time out of your day, you don't have time to relax. How can you sit and say that? You're wasting time just standing there. OTHER_NAME and new batches of friends are making messes that I can't clean in a day, and instead of helping, you wonder how much time it will take out of your life. When you refuse to help by doing community service, you're just insisting that your life be cut short. Think about that the next time you worry about the time.

Who's to say that community service can't be fun? Don't knock it till you try it. Community service is a great way to meet new people who are also trying to better the earth. It not only helps clean the earth and lengthen your life span, it creates new bonds and friendships as well. I remember when I first met ""Rain"" and ""Sun"", they helped make clean up of OTHER_NAME and her gangs messes so much easier. My first act of community service in elementary school was picking up trash from our playground after field day, and I've been doing it ever since.

I know you may think, community service is boring, community service is for janitors and convicts, I won't be able to hang out with my friends if I do community service. You're wrong! Community service is a great way to meet people, it's a great way to lengthen you're life span, and a great way to clean up the planet. If this doesn't convince you that community service should be required for all students to graduate, nothing will. Please think about this not just for you, but for future generations. See you next month OTHER_NAME.

I think that students should be involved in community service because then it gives other schools good examples on how great our school is. And it also sets a good example. If we do community service then we are helping our environment and grow big as a society. We will be helping the earth and stop pollution.

If all students perform it then the more help there will be to help out. My idea is to have groups of people every week to stay after school and do community service. Students can pick out the people they would like to work with and turn a sheet in for what team they are on and what grade and then the teachers will set out who goes with who, depending on the number of how big the group is then it will all be sorted out.

That's one way of doing it and then the other thing that might interrupt that is if they are in after school activities then those kids wont have to do it but when their activity is over with for the year then they will have to be in the week they are called in to doing community service.

And every Friday instead of having advisory we can try and clean up the community, like, picking up bottles, paper, cans, and any kind of garbage that might be on the ground.

Like I said before this can make a big difference in the world and make not just students but every one to actually care about how our environment looks and feels like.

Just like my mom always tells me ""If you want you're room to be clean all you need to do is clean it up.""

92AD77013CEE,"Mr. principal,

I believe making students do community service wouldn't be a good idea. Yes it is helpful to the community but it would have to be an outside of school assignment and many parents wouldn't be very thrilled about that. Some families do not have the money to take their kids places for community service or have the time. On top of homework, chores, and family things some students may feel overwhelmed. Then if it did not get done then it may mean an A or an F for that student making the student feel even more overwhelmed. The school would also have to take extra time to assign and organize the community service on top of their regular schedule.

An outside of school program for community service i believe would be a good idea. It would be like any other club or sport outside of school and students can take it willingly. If the students see that its easy to sign up and help out then i believe that more kids would help. Instead of adding stress onto the teachers and students day it would be easier to give the students and option.

2FA02A1E3654,"Dear Principle,

Community service should be performed by all students. Either picking up littler, or volunteering somewhere. The position that should be taken on this issue is positive.

Helping your community should be a reward itself, so why doesn't everyone help out? High schools everywhere have their students go out and log their community service hours. Doing and performing community service is a great act of kindness and should be done. Next, some community service projects can be as small as picking up random litter off the street, or as large as Habitat for Humanity. Helping people isn't a waste of time, sitting at home is a waste of time. Community service may take a long time or maybe even five minuets to complete. To graduate High School you have to have so many hours of community service, so why not start in Middle School? Maybe this will help someone find a career later in life that has to do with helping people.

In conclusion, the Principle should have their students do community service. It's not a waste of time, it helps students become more active and meet new people. Plus it doesn't just help out the students it help the community and the people in it, education of the outside world, and lastly it can help the school. Lastly, the stand I take on this is positive.

Community service is a great thing to be a part of, but you shouldn't have to do it if you don't want to. Community service is a great way to better your community. I feel that if you are forced to do it you wont take as much pride in the work that you are doing and the community wont look as good as it could if you actually wanted to be doing it.

Doing community service is great when you decide to do it yourself. There are so many was you can help out with your own community whether it be planting a garden, or to help build a house for someone who's home recently got burned down. But if you don't want to than why should you have to.

I agree that community service should be done more often by people, but those people should be volunteers that want to make there community a better place. Not by people that were forced to do it because their principle made it a requirement.

Community service can be fun. You and a friend can do it and be able to talk and have fun while helping out your own community, but if you just don't want to than no one should be able to force you into doing it.

I highly disagree with making community service a requirement. Yes community service is great like I have already said, but you shouldn't be forced to do it.

Community service is a great way to show people that we care about the economy and what we can do for it.

Students should be able to sign up for community service on our school board or have teachers send out fliers to students.

Some student will be interested in helping the way our city looks.

It can make a difference all over the world.

I strongly say students should be required to do community service.

Hard labor would teach students how its going to be when your older and matured in your life.

The kids that would be working in community service can b have it on they're resume. Unlike other simpletons sitting around playing games all day.

This would bring them out of their shell and show them what it could be like and not be like if they are not looking forward in life. They wont have a choice but do community service and pick trash off the ground.

This can also teach them self-control and not be a dunce in life.

Having no self-control can commit to health and behavior problems.

Problems like serious crimes and injuries.

Community service can help their self-control and make them have a meaning in life.

Students will not be forced to do community service but they will have to do at least 2 days worth. It can make a difference in the world and in the community.

It doesn't only have to be cleaning up either.

46BE37782CD7,"Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that you may soon require all students to do community service as part of school. I am a busy person and I don't think you should add community service to the curriculum. I think that I have a better solution to this problem. Instead of requiring all students to do community service, you could simply put in classes that are dedicated to helping the community. That way, people who enjoy helping the community will be able to do it in school and be graded on it.

Another reason why I don't think you should require people to do community service is because some people already are required to do community service for other events. For example, as part of me being confirmed, all my classmates and I are required to perform 10 hours of community service. I also know many other people who have to do the same thing for religious groups and clubs. If you added community service to the school curriculum, it would only burden the lives of people who have many other obligations in their lives. That is what I think and I'm sure many others would agree with me.

However, if you were to require all students to do community service. It would be optimal if you made it a manageable number of hours. Or perhaps you could simply make it part of certain classes instead of doing it outside of school as I stated before. After all, I and many other students my age enjoy having time to ourselves away from school and it would really bog down our lives if community service was added to the already long list of things that a student must do in a day such as sports, clubs, homework, etc. I also think it would be unfair because I know many people who already have trouble getting there homework done as it is and adding community service to that would make it even worse.

Please consider the proposition I have made. As I think it will benefit us all in the long run. Do not add community service to the list of requirements of school.

I think it would be better to have every one should do community service. If every one did this i think our city would be cleaner and healthier. If we were going to do this i would want it to be during school hours. If we did it during school hours people couldn't say that it takes time away from there schedule like sports. Also if we did this during school hours people couldn't tell their teachers that we dent do our homework because we were to busy doing community service.

Another good reason to have every one in our school to do community service to help other kids. If we learned something and some else doesn't get it we could help them with what they don't get. Another good reason to do it during school hours if so someone need help with school work we can help them at school so we don't have to go to their house. Also so if we do it during school and not go to their house more people might want to help because if their at home they wont to take time out of their schedule to help someone.

If every one did it and not just a couple people couldn't make fun of other people for having to clean up trash or helping someone because they will be doing it to. If everyone did this they might be nicer in the future and help someone out because they have already done it once before. I hope you enjoyed reading my letter and taking it in consideration thanks.

Community service has become a heated argument across the school.

Some think it should be required for all students, while others think it would take too much time away from what they need or want to do.

Community service is a big part of a strong community and good citizens complete their share of it.

So, why wouldn't we require this at our school for all students?

There is no reason not to.

Our school needs to require all of the students to complete community service.

The purpose of the school is to create educated citizens that will work to improve their community.

We teach things like math, science, and social studies to complete this task, and we bring in educators from programs like CPR to help as well.

So now that we are educated, and can help ourselves, it is important we make time for helping other people.

Community service is an easy and fun way to do that.

Some people ask how community service could benefit our school.

Well, teaching kids to go out of their way and help others now will create habits to help others when they are an adult.

Learning about the hardships of others can also teach us to appreciate what we have and how lucky we are to have the homes and jobs we have.

When I went in to my church to help feed the homeless and play games with the kids it really made me thank my lucky stars that I was blessed with all I have.

Not only did I give thanks after I visited the homeless, I also made new friends.

Their names were OTHER_NAME and OTHER_NAME, and they were both nice kids.

With all of these benefits it is obvious to see that community service should be a requirement for all students at our school.

Amazingly, there are many more benefits to this idea.

Completing community service will keep students of the street and out of trouble.

Instead of doing drugs they will be making someone less fortunate feel loved and happy.

I have no doubt that a full stomach, warm place to sleep, and someone to play Life with made OTHER_NAME and OTHER_NAME happy.

It would have made any homeless person happy, and more and more of them can achieve that good feeling and healthy life style if more people complete community service.

In conclusion, community service should be required out of every student at our school.

If students say they don't have time, they can always make time.

If you don't do it for the school or the students, do it for the hundreds, maybe thousands, of people and families that will get a second chance in life.",4,Community service,Independent

Hello, I have notice you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service. Some might agree with you because our community needs to be taking care of. On the other hand, others might degree because they believe community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. I would like to tell you why i believe that you should be required to perform community service.

Some agree that the community service is needed because we need to take care of our community.

It is very important to take care of the community. If we don't then our community would have litter all over the ground, elementary children need help and if we are not willing to help them then not good grades would be on their report cards. We don't have a lot of people helping in our community services so we need more helpers but the people we do have doesn't regret helping out and serving their job.

Other students however, believes that community service takes too much time away from things they want and need to do. Now a lot of students play sports and homework and etc. but maybe on days that they don't have anything to do or they have extra time they can service the community. Only if it is only an hour at the soup kitchen, I'm sure they wouldn't mind helping out even if it isn't a lot of time.

I believe that students should be required to perform community service because we need to clean up on community and help out. It doesn't matter if it is just an hour or if it is five hours, students need to learn to help out with the surroundings around us. I strongly believe that students need to be required because they will see the fun and great feeling of taking care of the community.

Thank you for taking your time and reading this letter. I hope you understand my thoughts about your decision.

Take care, fellow students.",3,Community service,Independent
76D57BCC7A10,"dear principal of our school, community service should not be required in school, this is because some people who do not have a lot of time on their hands would go crazy trying to perhaps juggle school projects, homework, out of school jobs that take up most of their day. So tell me how all of our students who do all of these things and then would have to put community service on top of that i think not Mr. principal sir. that is just wrong. Now for someone who never does their school work does not have a job and just sits around on their lazy butts all day long those are the people that should be doing community service not the people that work as hard as they possibly can all day and barley have their eight hours of rest shouldn't be doing it the ""other guys should"".

So what I am thinking is to go to every teacher in the building and see what students work there hardest and what students don't and try to see who have after school jobs and who doesn't. and the people who do not work hard all day every day they should be the students doing community service not the hard working students.

What is community service to you? Is it something you absolutely have to do because someone told you that you have to, or is it a good service that you do out of the kindness of your heart? I don't know about you but i think that real true community service comes from the heart. This is why i do not think that a principal should tell you that you have to do community service for a grade but maybe he/she could nudge you in the right direction.

You shouldn't have to do service because someone has told you to because it is not service if you are forced into it or technically paid with a grade. As i said before it should be because you want to not because someone has told you to. You may think that it is alright to tell someone what they have to do because you think they need it. If they need it they will know deep down inside that they do.

I also believe that principals shouldn't get into their students personal lives, because some kids already have enough on their plate with homework, sports, clubs, etc. You may not even know that they work at a soup kitchen or help in a homeless shelter. There are many good Samaritans out there but they don't tell anyone because that would ruin it.

There are many good people in this world even if they don't do community service and that is why i believe that service should not be pushed onto kids heads. Principals may have power over them at school but they cannot decide for the students how to spend their free time. So you may not believe what i have said today but you might have, so i hope that i have made an impact on you today.",3,Community service,Independent

I think that student's should do community service because it help those that need help like old people and our community when they clean up trash and recycling it can also be fun like making games out of it like for example trash hokey were they use trash as the buck and trash cans as the goal. So I say that students should have to do community service even if does take time it can still be fun. I think the school should have a week that sponsor's community service and all the stuff people do to help our community they should get a day to play games that involve community service like trash hokey and other games like that because our community is great and we should keep it that way for along time to come and it doesn't have to be picking up litter it could be tutoring elementary school children during the after noon or helping the old do stuff like go outside and enjoy the fresh are and the sunshine that's the important stuff and the helpful stuff that we should all do every now and then.

They are just not helpful enough or just don't want to do nothing at all. The people who think cleaning are environment is good they are so right and some people should learn from them.

Clean environment means more animals survive and healthy plants for everyone to enjoy. Some people just don't understand natures true beauty in life. All of them think its all electrical keep us alive will is not some of it maybe , but not all. So that's why we shouldn't get community service cause some people just don't understand about it.

I heard that you were deciding whether to require all students to perform community service.

Everyone has their different opinion on community service. Some people think that community service is very important, while others feel that it takes up too much of their time, based on what I have heard from my friends.

My suggestion is that I feel as if community service should be a requirement. Although some students find it a waste of time, it would be good to have everybody helping out their community. I feel that if the students are required to do community service, they might end up enjoying it and changing their views on it. Chances are they might end up feeling good about themselves after doing a good deed for their community. Plus, there are many different ways to serve community service. I think that the students that feel as if its a waste of time might find something they can do to help out their community and enjoy at the same time.

I think it would be great to have everybody helping out with their community and making it a better place.

Please take some time to think over my suggestion.

791E0902EAD5,"Dear principle, I don't think all of the students should have to do community service. I don't think all kids should do community service because I find that as a punishment for doing something bad. I don't believe all students should have to do community service because prisoners of jail have to sometimes do that. Or other naughty teenagers have to do that. So I don't believe good teenagers have to pick up trash or have to do any other subjects like that. Plus if a student signed up for football every day after school from 3-5 pm and community service is from 3-4 pm. What do the parents who paid all that money do know? The football organization doesn't give it back. The parents are out of that money and the child inst playing football which the money went to in the first place. So really it would be affecting the parents and the parents wouldn't be happy with you.

On the other hand if the students don't have any after school activities to participate in that would be a whole another story. If the students didn't have any after school activities to go to then nobody would be super mad except for maybe the students. If you made everyone do community service then all you would hear around the students is moaning and groaning from the students that don't like doing the community service. Student will eventually would want those after school activity's back and the kids will go to there parents and there parents will go to you asking what happened to those after school activity's?

AN alternative solution would be having a sign up sheet for kids and adults to sign up on if they wanted to do community service. Such as picking up liter and help tutoring children that need extra help in some that they may need help in.      ",3,Community service,Independent
DE4A7CBFD4DF,"dear principle, i believe this should NOT be mandatory to do community service.

in fact i think schools should only work with students School time and home work. any thing beyond that is not right. students go to school to learn not to be forced to do labor ""community service"".

Making it mandatory for students to go out on their time and do community service will cause problems with their agenda, home work ""projects, dead lines, work, etc"".

lets say a student is needing to catch up on a lot of work or they wont pass. so he figures out a schedule that will get all his work done.

but then he has to do community work for no reason, this might upset him because he can not get all his work done and he will not pass putting him into a depression.

now let me give you another example, say a student is unable to work, what if he is over weight and cannot bend down to pick up trash or cant walk around in the heat, does that mean he doesn't pass?

did you know that most young kids today are over weight and cannot perform those tasks, this idea is incorrect and will enter fear with a lot of things.",3,Community service,Independent
ECD81C1A4F62,"I think all the students could do the community work. That way not just one person is doing the work for everyone. Also if everyone does the community work it would be getting done faster and you wouldn't have to keep asking others to help. If all the students do the community work then that can help them realize and understand what needs to be done around our country/area. it will also teach the students to respect the planet we live on and not to litter or do something bad to something that is not ours. Maybe it would help teach the kids to work together and it would get them outside . It could show others that don't like to do work for others or pick up after them self's / others that if they all worked together they wouldn't have to worry about doing the work if they just didn't litter or vandalize others stuff that doesn't belong to them . So i take position to saying the principal to making everyone do community work even if its out side of school, just for maybe an hour maybe every other day, to get the students to learn to work together, get along and respect others property and belongings, help other kids that may be behind in something or just need a little more understanding in a subject some homework that they didn't quiet didn't understand at home that night.",2,Community service,Independent
2A16D21F4FC8,"Dear Principal,

Doing community service is a choice. Some kids want to do it, others think that its stupid. I don't think that there is any reason that you should have to force kids to do it but you should reward them for it. If you reward kids by doing community service say you give them some money it might inspire more kids to help out. This is a great idea because it doesn't force kids to do anything but it gives them a reason to want to help out. A reasonable ratio may be for every 4 hours of community service they get 20 dollars. Maybe a kid might want a new laptop and he's 40 dollars short. He could spend one long day working and he could get enough money to buy that laptop. Its a great and productive way to get kids to help out. Say that 10% of your school does community service now. If we add in the reward we could bump that up to 50%. It would make our town a much better healthier place. You may have noticed the trash on the soccer field behind our school. That could all be cleaned up if you offer this reward to the kids at our school. You could even offer it too adults. If we did that we would be the cleanest, smartest town ever. That definitely appeals to you considering you are the head of a school. You want all of your kids to do as good as good as possible in there school work. Your school could have the best grades in the state. Our town would be so amazing. So you can see how much encouraging kids to do community service is good for our school but forcing them, that's not going to help anything. If you force them to do community service then they wont put all of there effort into it. That could make the town even worse. Kids could start failing school on purpose in retaliation of being forced to do school work.

I agree we should clean up the entry school in end up clean like a whistle. The principal should lets take some breaks once for a while. When school is over we should stay at school until 5:00 p. m. therefore cleaning up the liter and stuff off the ground and throw it away in the trash can. We should have a break at 3: 50 to 4:15 p. m. that gives us plenty of time for a break.

But, let some people to go home so they can watch some of their favorite shows and play their video games. Once for a while they will come back help us because they did all their chores and their's nothing on TV. I will go home because I have to do chores and feed my animals. Plus sometimes I might have a bad day and want to get away from people. In a few minutes I would get over with it come back to school to make it better.

I don't want anybody to come to this school and say "" This school doesn't look right because all this litter and trash all around the campus "", I would get up change the school picking up piece by piece unit it the cleanest school in Jefferson Davis County. We also need to clean the walls , decorated the school parking lots and cafeteria. We should build a new break room full with snack bars, soda machines, and rooms for people so they can talk on break. It would be good if you give us a break between Ist and 2nd. We could reorganize the gym because a lot people are trash behind after the game is over. We could put a trash can on the stands so the when the people leave out the gym it would be a little clean.

Community service is a way to distinguish selfish people from selfless people. Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people. At our school we should enforce that kids have to participate in community service at least twice a year.

Community service makes people feel better. It is a very moving experience when you give food to someone who is hungry. It teaches you to be appreciative of what you have after you see someone who has nothing. It also makes you feel good inside. Having community service might change the attitude of some kids at your school.

Some people think that community service is useless or a waste of time. But in reality it only takes up a few days a year of an average persons life. To only make the kids do two days of community service is no high price for anyone. It even doesn't take up the entire day, only a couple of hours.

Community service helps people, makes you feel better, and is not a humongous time consumer. Anyone who has some extra time should defiantly chose to do some. No one has a busy enough schedule do not be able to participate. As the principal of the school please require students to do community service.",3,Community service,Independent

I think that we shouldn't have to do community service if we don't have to time to do it. Say if we play sports we wouldn't have the time of day to it and if you make us do it on weekends kids might not show up or some might become upset with you. So i think you should let the kids pick or if they do it give the some extra credit . I play sports and I only have time to help on the weekends and sometimes i will be tried and many other kids who play sports might feel the same way as I do.

But if you do pick to make kids do community service I will understand why it helps kids learn to help out other people besides your self and some kids can really learn from just helping a couple of people out. But its up to you there are some positives and negatives with this choice.

I think we should take a vote to see how many kids would like to do community service and who wouldn't. If a lot of kids don't then let the kids who want to go out and help do it. For the kids who don't maybe they will change their minds if their friends tell them how fun it is because they still are hanging out even if they are helping people out while they are doing it. I wouldn't know which to pick for a while i would ask my friends if they do it to give me some positives and negatives on it. Then i would try it and see if i like it and if i do i will keep going along with this act.

So this is a hard choice for you to pick but i would just go by the vote of your students. Plus maybe a lot of kids will choose to do community service and you wouldn't have to make everyone do it . Since i wrote this paper I think i would vote to do community service and i think i would convince some more kids to go along with this just to see how it is. Then I see they whole school would come along to do this .

I heard that you are deciding on whether or not you want to make every student do community service. Some students do community service because they have to in some form of punishment.

I believe that if a student has done something wrong, for a punishment you should then make them do community service.

For example if a student breaks one of the rules and gets in a fight with someone at the school on school property, the punishment you could give them instead of suspension is community service.

Some students volunteer in community service because they like to help out the community if they have spare time. Usually when students volunteer in community service, it's because they want to.

Other students don't volunteer in community service because they feel like its a waste of their time and they won't be able to do what they want.

I don't think it's a good idea that you want to make sure every student performs some kind of community service because some students might be busy and not have time to perform any community service and if they don't, they will probably get punished even if it's not their fault.

So in conclusion of this statement, I personally don't think making every student perform community service is a good idea.

Of course they can do it if they are being punished but it shouldn't be required.

I think people should do community service if they really want to because you cant force a student to do something that they don't want to do. But in my opinion i think people should do community service at least once or twice a week so we are not destroying earth. Because people don't want to help earth become a better place, then that's how we suffer pollution which is a really bad thing for earth, and community service helps earth stay in good shape and it also keeps earth healthy.

Some people don't want to do it because they think they have more important things to do like make earth even more worse or hang out with friends. But if they could just use 10 minutes of there time to make earth a better place then we wouldn't have to do community service. There are more ways people wouldn't have to do community service and that is to pick up your trash and not litter and that is a really good example for doing community service and not doing it. But people just have to have enough patience to do it, but no, they just don't want to get there hands dirty so that's why they don't want to do it.

But i say we should do community service, but not every day just maybe two times a week so that way people wont cry on how boring it is to do community service. Some people agree with me because they don't want earth to be a bad place. But some don't because they just don't want to do anything because they are lazy.

What I think about community service is something that a lot of people do around the world. In church school the nuns tell the people in church school to do community service do that we help the nuns in everything or we clean the garbage that is thrown in the floor. My friend OTHER_NAME use to do community service when he was still in church school he was dong community service. I never did that when I was in church school. Some people say is fun cause you meet new people and you learn new things in the world. People that I know still do community service. They say that sometimes they get paid when they do something. you could even do is when there is snow on the ground and nobody have shoveled the snow you should do it . If the person was a old person and they cant do it themselves.

We help other people that's something nice you could do. I help a little second grader do his homework but he has problems. When he's writing his hand start to shake a lot now is a year helping him now his hand doesn't shake at all. His parents say that he have learned a lot of things from me and I'm happy that they say that. My mom say to thank god that I got that job now I could buy something with my own money that I need to buy in school or clothes or shoes that I want. That's why when I grow up I wanna be a teacher I'm learning to be a teacher with the little kid. It's fun and you remember everything that you did in elementary school. Sometimes you forget but you remember or the little kid shows me.

should let us have community service. People are lazy to do community service. Because they just wanna chill around with they're friends and they don't do they're homework.

I think that students should be required to do community service.

So that instead of students always doing things for themselves they should do something for someone else for a change. I will say this to all the students.

Why stay in the house all day playing video games, doing nothing, just watching television? When you could be helping someone in need or help the environment get healthy

One way you can help your community is by planting a tree, giving food to the homeless, volunteering at an animal shelter or a homeless shelter.

You maybe want to change your life but help someone change theirs. How would you feel if you really needed help or wanted to make a change but no one will help you and no one will support you in any way what so ever, what do you think will happen to you if your homeless or don't have enough oxygen because you never tried to plant a tree not a day in your life?

I believe our school should have community service.

Why ?

Because, students should not litter on school property and make our school look trashy.

School is a place to learn not to litter and destroy the schools .

In the following paragraphs, I will persuade you to require school community service in our school.

In SCHOOL_NAME, the population of litter is huge.

Students here think after using an object and its time to dispose it, it belongs on the ground.

All students at SCHOOL_NAME

should take part and help.

Making our school look better will be a big helping hand.

By that I want to totally help to clean up our school !

I would first make a survey. Post it out in each hallway in the school.

Then I would have every student to sign yes if they think its a good idea to have community service or no.

With the following students that has pick yes I will call a meeting.

Next I would ask them what days are good to stay after school and clean or can they come everyday.

The students that will not take part of this act I would make another community service.

Our school looks horrible especially the break areas.

Also the court yard of the school pavement need to be refill with concrete.

The school walls, classrooms, and hallways need to be repainted.

The graffiti on the hallways wall and outside the school building walls need to be painted over.

I strongly believe us students can do it.

With this all said and done, Principle TEACHER_NAME I have may reasons why you should require school community service. First I believe our school should have community service because it looks trashy not classy.

Second because students think trash belongs on the ground. My third reason is because inside the school building needs repainting.

I think it is a very good thing for all kids our age to do community service. It helps out with pollution and helps keep our town clean.

Some kids like to do it but some kids don't. Most of us think it takes time away from fun activities we do over weekdays and weekends. I highly suggest that we make a sign-up board in the cafeteria for kids who want to work certain hours. I think Wednesday through Saturday is suitable. We can sign up and pick put 5 to 10 people we want to be in our groups. I think groups will help this problem.

I think most kids don't like it because there not working with their own very close friends. I honestly feel that way too. We all want to have fun and enjoy helping out.

Now as far as the helping out with Elementary kids goes, I think we can do the same thing. We can all come up with fun ideas for the kids and do it with them. On summer days we can do fun activities outside and have food and drinks. I think the School board wont mind if we use a tiny bit of money on pizza or chips. If they do I think we could chip in some money. When it is cold and winter we could do activities in the classrooms. We can have movies and hot chocolate. We can also bring board games for the kids.

I strongly believe that community service is something good, and that all the students should be willing to perform community service in some way. Community service teaches us many valuable things.

And it also gives us the opportunity to aid others that need it.

Community service is very important in many ways. First, is a way of helping, and growing together as a community.

Also, we shouldn't expect someone else to do our job. We are the future of our community/country; and if we are growing up expecting we don't have to do anything, we will have very few chances of being successful.

It is definitely not a waste of time.

We can do many things we like for community service.

Like if we like math, or are good at it, we could tutor those who need more help. Or if we are interested in justice, or working for peace, we could volunteer at places that do that kind of work.

Furthermore, community service doesn't have to be boring, we could take our friends, or siblings. Then they will learn from our example, we will have company, and our virtues will spread throughout our community.

Finding ways to perform community service is very easy; just talk to your parents, neighbors, classmates, etc. Something else is that it doesn't have to be the biggest thing ever. Small actions will lead to great achievements.

Doing small actions every day, sometimes without even planning, will help our community grow in many ways.

We will also benefit from these actions. When we need help we will know that our neighbor or classmate will be there to help us and will take care of us. When we are older, the younger kids we showed all those virtues, will keep passing them to their family, friends. Soon we will see all the great things we achieved.

I think that in high school students should at least a month of community service to pass to the next grade. It is important that they help out because if they don't the community well become more of a mess then it already is.

2290CEF95268,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students including myself, should NOT be Required to perform Community Service for Three Different Reasons. One reason is because It takes Up time of our everyday life. For Example, Students Will be exhausted and won't have enough energy or time to complete their EVERYDAY Homework If Community Service was Instructed. Teachers, School Employee's, and Parents are always hard on Students about Not completing their Homework or Schoolwork and this here situation will just make that task even worse. Time is being simply taken away from the Students if Community Service was Required and Students won't have any room to do some of their everyday Needs/Wants.

Another Reason Community Service is Not required by students Is because, Its deals with Tutoring Elementary Students, and Cleaning the Community. Don't get me wrong their's Nothing wrong with help other friends/associates out, As a matter of fact that's a good example Of Team Work. All I'm saying Is Tutoring should be done by a Teacher, After all they do get paid for TEACHING. And community service as in cleaning up litter, should be Done by the Citizens of Miami Gardens, Or Prisoners. I've seen Prisoners being watched to clean up the City of Miami Gardens. If these Things were done by School Students their would be no jobs for Teachers or The City Workers which means No money to Supply for Themselves, Kid, and Bills. Its okay for Students to do this but I just Don't think it's a Suitable Idea for Community Service.

Lastly, Community Service should NOT be required for Students to do because, Community Service should be something else instead of Tutoring, or Picking Up Trash. It should be a Meeting, with all The Citizens of Miami Gardens getting together, and Talking about ways they Could Do things better. For Example, Things such as, Not Polluting, Teaching better or to the point when all the Students understand, Should be Discussed At This Meeting. If this was done I Do believe their would be No Point/Need for ""Community Service"".

The youth might also not do a very good job at this either. Therefore children should not be forced into community service.

Many children already do community services, because they chose to. You should support this idea but not make it a rule. Extra credit should be given to the students to motivate them. the students need to learn to make the right choices not forced>

some children can not find time in there week to community service>students might even have too much homework to take time for these services>many children are being tutored themselves<and cannot tutor or take any time off to do community work>

teens these days do not try as hard to do community services than other age groups>they might even vandalize the community while they are doing the work>inmates should be forced to do community work instead of teens because the inmates will learn more from it and they will be supervised more carefully>if students are tutoring other students< they might teach the m the wrong ideas>

students have to learn what choices are to be made>many people are plowed with other activities other than community services>most teen wont even try to do this work because they will think its a waste of time>overall students should not be forced to do community service<thank you>

I do think that students should perform in community service because it is very important to clean up our school and also to have a very good environment or all the animals in the ocean will die and when we want to go to the Aquarium they will be no more animals to see. Why not you might asked because most of them will be dead or might be surviving a death full time. For Example if the students in out school start to perform community service our school will always be clean and its a great work to show team work and that anything that we try to do it will always accomplished. I also don't think its a waste of time because we never give time to start caring about our environment and start caring and helping about others people health.

See if the more we liter and recycle the more healthier our plant will be and if we don't help then our environment will be very dirty we won't be able to breath our nice natural environment instead will be breathing dirty stuff and we don't want that to happen because then everybody in the plant will die including the animal it's like the end of the world but because we didn't give time to take care of our plant and just decided to do something else less important than our health. However, that's why i think its important to recycle and liter.

Also, because it's a great time to use our teamwork and show our love to everyone and how much we care about there health and also a great way to make new friends and new changes to our school and our plant Hope you make all your students attend in community service.

I think you should make community service mandatory for a few reasons.

First, community service should forced because it make our area a better place to live overall. Picking up litter makes it a cleaner and more enjoyable place to be.

Next community service shouldn't be optional because it builds character. It develops compassion and kindness in people. It helps them realize that the place they live in is important to them and to other people.

Lastly, community service is important because it gets people off their couch and in to the streets helping people. It helps to make kids realize how tough the real world is and how hard it will be when they grow up. And, of course, colleges love kids who do good things for their community, like community service!

I can see why people say that community service isn't necessary. But I think that they say it because they are just lazy. We need to get them out and about teaching children or picking up litter

As you can see, community service is crucial and should be mandatory for all kids in our school. Without community service, the state of our city will deteriorate until it is no more.

B111395C3C6E,"I think it would be bad to have community service. I choose this reason because some kids never have time to do anything and making them do community service would just waist their time to have fun. Plus what if some kids have after school activities and must go to them then they would get in trouble. That would cause a lot of trouble in the school.

If kids just went to community service everyday they would be tired when they got done causing kids to be lazy in the future and end up being overweight. Then they would end up not going to work and jobs wouldn't be getting done. If jobs didn't get done then we wouldn't have any new technology and we would slowly die out of the human race. No one wants that to happen do they?

If kids went to community service then their parents wouldn't really get to spend time with them because the kids would be working after school and they would be too tired when they got done working that they would go straight to sleep when they got home. they wouldn't be able to spend time at them on the weekend because the kids would want to have the time they could to play without having to go to work. Then the parents would be sad because they never have any time with their kids and the family would slowly fall apart. That's another reason why community service is bad.

What I'm trying to say is that you should not tell students to do community service. You don't know what they have going on in their lives. They could be a professional basketball player.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe that students should be required to do community service. I say this because they need to learn how to help others instead of thinking about themselves all the time. I strongly believe that all of the students will benefit from this one way or another.

I think that if the principals of all public schools in Georgia would require students to do community service the world wouldn't be as cruel as it is. Some students just need to be put on track. If the parents would support the principals the children would and/or should want to listen to their parents, and do what their parents think is best for them. I know people think that picking up trash out of the streets is cruel, but actually it's not. It's just showing that you do care about your community. But picking up trash is not the only thing you can do, you can volunteer as a tutor, someone who helps the elderly, and also someone to help the little people of the world. Help them understand the things that they shouldn't do. I believe they would learn a lot. Once you

D30490AE8641,"Dear Principle,

I'm writing you this letter to inform you on what i think you should do. I know you are trying whether or not if all students should be required to do any community service. Community service is good but not all the students would wan' t you to make it a requirement. So here is my argument on what you should do.

I think that you need to think about the community service. Some of the kids are already doing some community service and they would probably like the help, but what do you think the other kids who don't wan' t to do community service will react to you saying all students now have to do community service. The kids who have to do might try to get their parents to let them drop out of school, because i wouldn't want to do community service.

If you make the kids do community service the community might get into better shape than it already is. You also have to think that kids wouldn't have enough time to get some of their homework finished or be able to go to their after school activities. I think that if you make the kids do it they wouldn't, you would have to punish them for not doing the community service so that would just make the students made at you. The parents are a very hard subject. Some of the parents might like their kids going out and doing some community service instead of being home all of the time, but there are other parents that probably wouldn't like their kids being away from home any longer than being at school.

The teachers at school are also a very big subject. They wouldn't be able to give out as much homework so they would intern have to do more work at school. Doing more work at school would also mean the students would be less happy than they already were knowing that they have to come home just for more community service they had to do. There are some teachers that pretty much just give out homework and that would ruin there whole school year curriculum.

That is my argument about making kids volunteer for community service. Truthfully who wants to do more work than they already have to do. In my opinion school work is very hard without knowing you will have to go home knowing that after working all day at school the students just have to go home and work more.

I think its a great idea for students to help out and join community service, you should require all students to join. Helping the community is very important because there aren't a lot of people who would take the time to help out.

They probably think its a waist of time when its not. Not many people want to stop what there doing or some are just to busy. The community is a lot in need for some support and help, and we should give it to them if they need it.

There are a bungle of things that students can help with, little elementary kids with hard school assignments that parents come home too late to help with.

dirty ponds and lakes that need cleaning up, parks with loads of trash everywhere, buildings with nasty spray paint all over and senior citizens who need help around the house. Also on Halloween there's little kids who need to get around the area without trouble, and not all little kids have older brothers and sisters to take them.

There are animal shelters and so much more they can do for the community.

I have friends in the ninth grade who perform service to the community and it helps them with there high-school diploma. Some just do it because they think its right and a good thing. So that's why Mr. principle all of us and students should come together and do what we can for the community.            ",4,Community service,Independent

I think everyone would agree that community service can get a little annoying. However, doing community service, whether you like it or not, makes everyone a better person. It's always nice to help someone out or make our community a better and nicer place to live in. Community service can be anything from picking up trash that you see lying around to visiting a nursing home just to brighten someone's day. I understand that not everybody has a lot of time on their hands with sports and all different types of activities, but sometimes missing out on things that might be fun to you is worth it in the end. For example, my Mom Mom is a clown. One time I went with her to the nursing home and I can not even tell you how good it felt to see those people smile. With my Mom Mom and I visiting I could just tell how much it meant to them. My Mom Mom would pop one of her corny jokes ... but the patients in the nursing home absolutely LOVED our company. I could tell just by the way they looked at us with a smile from ear to ear that we brightened up their day. I had to miss skating, a sport that i have been doing since I was two years old, to do this community service project, but let me tell you... it is DEFINATELY worthwhile.

The feeling you get when you see these people's faces are priceless. It's amazing how contagious a smile is. You can not get that feeling of accomplishment... or that feeling that you actually made someone's day that much better any other way other than performing community service. Yes, it sounds like a pain. I do not know any other way to say it other than to BELIEVE ME when i say that knowing that you helped our community in a positive way is one of the greatest things ever. The reason why I am writing to you today is to tell you that I truthfully believe that it should be a requirement for every student in our school to complete some sort of community service project. Whether it is walking a marathon to raise money, picking up trash lying around, visiting a nursing home, feeding the poor, donating food or clothes to a charity, or simply just making someone smile, community service is so easy to do and makes our society a much safer and nicer place. With all this being said, please take into consideration that community service does everyone good. Not only does it help our society but it also makes everyone a better person inside and out.

This is a good idea because you could help older people or help the custodian have the school cleaner. If we have community service we might be the highest state or city that is the cleanest of the fifty states in the year 2011. That would be cool because we could be recognize in the whole world. You could tell people not to be in gangs but in church this would help because we don't have that much people dyeing or killing each other.

Besides helping little kids is really important because your helping them not to litter or to be mean to other little kids. Elementary is the most important place not to litter because little kids just see a candy n the ground and they just pick it up and put it in the mouth. If we see students doing community service the parents might be proud of there child because there helping the community to be more cleaner. If i would do community service i would help people with there yards and if i saw and adult throw a peace of paper i would say kindly can you please pick that up lets try to clean our community please.

In my opinion i would be picking things up than the city or the state would look or smell bad. actually the parents should educate there child since there little and teach them not to litter anywhere.

I send you this letter to let you know about the arguing that has been going on our school whether students should be required to perform community service or not. Well my opinion is that performing community should be an optional, however I think teachers should encourage students to do it. Teachers can encourage students by offering rewards such as extra-credits.

I believe this method would work on students, this way students can do better on school and help their community, all at the same time. If we were to require them, those students that say to not have time would feel as if they were obligated to work for something that does not benefit them. On the other hand if we didn't encourage them, they simply wouldn't do it.

Community service is a great thing to do to help the earth. Some students feel that community service isn't right for them to do and it takes up their leisure time. It would be great to get things done. For example, cleaning up trash can stop pollution and make earth look more organized. Instead of laying around and doing nothing or going out with a couple of friends, you can always pick another day to do that. Once the trash man comes, that trash being picked up is eventually going to get polluted. It would be best to get it and recycle rather than having the worst done to it. In the end, you will be appreciated and it will benefit you in your future.

Tutoring younger children can be benefiting as well. When children grow up to be smart, they might be the ones who make the world better. Having extra help when they needed, showed that someone cared for their future and that can build confidence in what they really want to do in life.. I feel that if we do it now, things will change for the better. Some of us may not see it now but they will in the future. I believe that thinking ahead makes you plans go smoother.

I am writing to you on behalf of your decision on requiring community service for all students. I think community service is a great experience for all people. Although, I don't think it should be required. When something is required to do something it feels like somewhat of a chore. Also, when you are doing community service you are doing it to help people or the environment not just to build up a grade in class. You simply can not make some one do community service. There are ways for you to get more people into doing community without forcing them. For example, a lot of people want to help the community but they have a hard time finding services to work on. So what you can do is set up a bulletin board up in the school that displays all of the possible opportunities. I would also advise you not to reward the students who do community service because, again community service is not about rewards but, giving out to the community. Please take these words into consideration.

This school should have the children here do community service. They should be required to learn good social skills and manners. Children nowadays are very lazy and rude to elders and people on a daily basis. The community is suffering their horrible acts to it. We need to teach them how to perform community service to save them from their community belittling.

Community service is very important. The community you live in tells who you are. Most people make their homes look nicer and the area around it to make sure nobody gets the wrong first impression about them. This should be taken into consideration. Many communities are not well kept and not nice to look at. The school's property looks horrible because of the way these kids treat it. Community service should be expected from children in this school and they should do it twice in a school year.

Manners and social skills are important to have and these kids don't. Because of this when they get a job they will be rude to their boss and the people around them whether their in a bad mood or not. If the person is trying to give a compliment and they say it the wrong way the person will be embarrassed. Without social skills they won't know how to talk to a person or know how to handle a bad situation. If you have realized ,the kids who do community service have good social skills and manners and they use they everyday!

Since the certain kids that don't do community service are lazy and don't want to do anything or get up to throw something in the trash where it belongs they throw it onto the ground and leave it there for someone else to pick it up. That is called littering. And it is illegal in some states. They could get in trouble and go to jail or get a fine. This would cause them to become behind on school work or not get into college for a little thing like littering.

All schools should have the kids do community service. If our school does it we would be setting a good example for ourselves and the kids who go to this school. That will help them get into college and get a good job. Simple things t]like manners and good social skills are very useful and are part of the bargain with community service. The kids here would be a lot nicer and put more effort into their work. Teaching these students how to perform community service would make this town and school a better place.",4,Community service,Independent

I would like to say that having students perform community service would not be right if they have plans. I think that these students should have the rights to decide on if they want to do it as a after school thing because some students would be busy with plans they want or need to do. Some students might not even do the community service and skip it. So it would be a better idea if you have them choose if the wanted to take there time of day and do community service.

Some of the students might not think of community service as very important and slack on there job on helping the community. If you have them work with elementary school children , they might not even help them or they might give the child the wrong answer just because they have to be stuck there working with that child and not be some where else. I don't think that would be a good idea to have them do that. Some students who would have to work with the litter might even litter them self or not even pick the trash up and hang out with his/her friends. Then there wouldn't be no work done and there would be a bigger mess to clean.

Even if you think about punishing these students for not doing there work, they wont care because they don't want to be there at all. If you make them do extra they just mess it up more. So would you like for the elementary school children to fail because you sent students to help them when they didn't want to at all? Would you want the parents of the elementary school children to be mad about what your students or teaching them? Do you want the parks or fields where these students have to pick up litter be even more a mess? Do you want these kids to make your community an undesirable place to be?

I think that students should have to perform community service hours. There are so many problems and sad nesses in this world that with even just a little help could be better. For example recycling, many people throw away plastic bottles everyday. This builds up and destroys our beautiful environment. With students help we could help inspire people to recycle and give out recycling bins to people around the community. We also have many tragedies everyday that put people at a loss. For example tornadoes destroying peoples homes. With students help we can rebuild new homes and even wash clothes for those who don't have them. While doing this students would not only giving the people a good home and making them happy ,but making the world a better place and setting a good example for others to help out. We already have wonderful volunteering businesses in the United States today that many students could help improve. So as you can see there are so many ways that students can make a big impact on the whole world. Kids could even just help by going from door to door in their neighborhood selling things such as magazines to raise money for charities. For all the wonderful things we have on earth it's really not to much to ask of someone to help out. Thank you for considering my thoughts.

I think its unfair to mandate community service. Some people think its a great i idea to do community service, but for some people it just takes to much time!

If we had more time on our hand then i would be all for community service, but don't have a lot of time to do anything after school. Our teachers give us too much home work and not enough time to do it all and now if it becomes mandatory to do community service no one will have any time to do anything but homework and community service. That is unfair and unjust taking a way our personal time. Before the only time i had to myself was sleeping, and now i will have to spend that picking up trash. Or reading to the blind. Or tutor elementary school students. Or spending my time with old people that have Alzheimer's disease, who can even remember the last time they went to the bath room.

D447C1CC7423,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do think community service is important for students to get involved in. Not only is it good for the community, but it is good for us to do things for ourselves and for others. Some of the reasons why I think community service is a good thing is because it is a great way to students to get involved in their community, it is a great thing for the environment, and it is a great thing for others, too.

The first reason why I think community service is a good thing is because it is a great way for students to get involved in their community. Kids these days have a bunch of new technology and they think they can just live off of that and that nothing else matters in the world except beating their high score at the newest video game. Well I have news for them. There are more important things to do than play video games all day. They can join clubs or just help people out. They can join a group that supports local charities or they can join together to help clean up the community. It doesn't have to be boring and you can do it with friends. You get to hang out with your friends while you help others, and I think that's the most important thing of all. We should start getting people involved with more community service.

The second thing why I think community service is a great thing is it's great for the environment. If you just throw your trash everywhere, it builds up higher and higher over time and now you have a dirty community and nobody wants that. And plus, littering is illegal and you can get a high- priced fine for doing it, so it's better to pick up the trash, rather than cause it. You can join your local YMCA or other clubs and go around and pick up a few pieces of trash because if 10 people each pick up 5 pieces of trash, that's already 50 pieces of trash! If you go out and do it even just once a week, you will have a better and a cleaner community in no time, and a cleaner community is always better for everyone.

The last reason why community service is a good idea and should be enforced is that it is a great thing to do for others too, not just yourself. Some people want to help out with jobs around their community but maybe they are elderly or they are sick or injured and they can't . This is where kids come in. They are in the best health of their lives right now so they can go out and help clean up around their elderly or sick neighbors house and I am sure that would just make their day because they aren't able to do it themselves. Plus, doing things for others doesn't just make them feel good, it makes you feel good because you know you have done a big deed for that person and it makes them really happy.

Now you see which side and take and why I think helping out in your community is such a good idea. It gets people involved in their communities and neighborhoods, it's a great thing to do for the environment, and it's a great thing to do for others who maybe can't do community service themselves. I think community service should be encouraged to kids and students of all ages because it is a great thing to do.

i wont deny that it would be good but its just that its kind of boring to pick up trash, sure its good for everything and everyone but i think that's just somebody else's job to worry about. i don't think that this could happen though because if it did how would you make it happen? if you did it would most likely have to be a before school or after school thing but who on earth would join some club that says ""the picking up trash club"" i don't think anyone would join that club because who wants to pick up trash all day? not me.

there's also another reason why we shouldn't do this, because there's a person in charge of picking up trash in schools and that's the janitors, I'm not being mean or anything but its true and the person that's in charge of picking up trash out side is the garbage people. if this did happen which its unlikely because of so many classes during the day that i don't think that this could possibly happen because its just unlikely. there are thousands of reasons that there shouldn't be a community service at our school because its a waste of time and there are millions of reasons why we shouldn't but that doesn't mean its a bad thing.

I think that all students should be required to do some community service. We all have to live in this town together so why don't we all take part in keeping it clean and a nice place to live. Community service is not just to keep things clean, but it is also to help people live a better and healthier life.

Some people don't think community service is worth the time, but those people have never taken the time to try it. They don't know the satisfaction you get when you see the smile on a person's face for doing the right thing. People always thank you and most of all you know inside that you did the right thing and that fills an emptiness inside.

Sometimes community service can be fun. If you happen to do something that you are interested in. Like maybe if you're into sports you could clean up your local sports complex. And create a better more fun facility for everyone.

Everyone that i know that has done any community service say they like it. They don't mind taking the time to do something good for someone else. Doing community service is also for your benefit, by keeping you up and active. It gives you something to do, rather than sitting at home on the coach being lazy eating potato chips and playing video games.

So I think that it would be a good idea for you to have everyone do some kind of service to help the community. So please take this letter into consideration. Thank you for your time and i hope this letter helps your decision.

I have been informed that there is a school issue regarding whether students should be required to perform community service. Students should be required to perform community service. I think it would really say something about our school and SCHOOL_NAME would take a leader role in the community. The students should be out helping the community rather than sitting on the couch eating potato chips. In just one hour, there can be a lot of beneficial improvements towards the community. This service can also count towards kids National Junior Honor Society and service hours for Conformation or Bar/Bat Mitzvah's. Service hours can show a lot about someone's character and I think if all students were required to do this, everyone's character would build and get better. The community as a whole would become much better. Students can learn from helping out the community and might find a passion for a particular service. Others will realize that all these students are really trying to make a nicer community and then the other's will feel obligated to help out too. It takes a special person to really be dedicated to community service. The students will learn more about themselves and what they can do that will really help out society. If students start making positive attributes to the community you might see less crimes going around. This will also lead to students making better decisions and seeing themselves as a different person.

I believe that all students should not be required to perform in community service. Some of the students just have too much on there plate already, then throw in something else, it will cause much drama that the school does not need. Even though community service is a great way to help out and fix things in your community it will just take up way to much time your students lives. The downside to not having every student involved in community is that colleges look at the student and their extra activities they are involved in outside of school. I know that would help some students that are going to college on a academic and sports scholarship but yet again it would have seen a waste to some of the students that are planning on not attending college. This year if i would have been forced to do community service it would have been a hassle for me since i play football and i am in double advance classes that takes up most of our evenings and sometimes even our weekends. Overall community service should not be required to all students maybe the ones who do not have anything to do after school or on the weekends that would be great but those who play a sport or are in a group, club or something like that it would not suit them well. All though community service is a very debated topic around the schools in our nation. It is as big as the board of education.

As you walk down the street you see trash, bottles and cups. Think how nice it would be if all of the students at our school had to do community service. I think community service should be required at our school. This would help everyone in the community. It would clean our parks and roads, help students and would teach students it isn't good to be lazy. I think it would be very smart to require students to do community service.

A normal day for a student is to come home from school and play video games. You could change that and have the students do something productive like cleaning roads and parks or helping fellow students by tutoring them. This wouldn't only help the students who are getting tutored or the parks and roads it would help the tutors and the cleaners they would be helping others by doing a very simple task.

If you didn't require this the students would become lazier than they all ready are and would sit and play video games all day!

On the contrary the students would be outside with their friends getting fresh air. This would help them stay in shape.

I know many students wouldn't like this but, if you made them work for 1 hour after school once a week or, 4 hours a month it would really contribute to citizens of our town and city. Think about how many people would love to walk and jog on the paths of our clean parks

I think requiring community service would assist everyone. Please consider this reasonable and fruitful idea.

I say yes that kids should have to do some community service. I think this because most kids these days are lazy and don't ever go out side to work, it will give them an advantage at what work will look like when there older, and they will also be able to see what kind of job fits them.

Most kid these days are usually inside playing xbox, play station or sitting on there couch eating crap like chips. I have a neighbor who never goes outside he's always inside playing video games or watching tv. When kids do this they aren't getting anywhere in there life. When they go to get there first job the people will ask them if they have any experience and they will say no and then they will never get a job. See and their life is just going to rot away. This is the first reason why kids should do community service.

Next they will have a look on what jobs are going to be like. Like if there are hard, to easy, to much, not enough. I work a lot with my dad he has a landscaping business and i have two horse that I have to take care of and work. I think landscaping would be to hard for me but i like to help out so i go and learn new things all most every time. And with my horses they are a lot of work they have me running around getting stuff that i need for them all the time like hay grain treats. So getting kids out on a job will show them what the real world is like and how scary and hard it can be.

Finally kids will be able to see what job fits them the most. Like a physically working job or sitting in a chair all day answering phone calls. I like being outside the most so i would like not to be in a chair all day just like school. I know some kids who have know clue what they want to be because they don't get showen enough what jobs are like in real life. If you are a video game freak when you do community service why don't you help little kids out playing them or something.

Ask you can see that doing community service as a kid, will give you a lot of benefits and more choices as what you would want to do when you are older.

Again it will help the lazy kids that do nothing all day, give kids advantages, and finally see what kind of job they will be good at. Get off your couch and help out the community now!",4,Community service,Independent
D8D90E042134,"In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying!

I personally think that you should give every kid community service. Giving kids community service really helps kids get out of trouble ,help our community and teach kids that helping the community can really help set a good example for the next generation to come.

First, I feel that you should give kids community service to make sure they stay out of trouble. Kids that go hang with friends usually are up to no good. Community service can give them a reason to stay out of trouble. It can really change a kid and teach them about the importance of keeping to community nice and safe

Also, community service can help teach kids to be more respectful to our communities. this can also set a good example for younger kids so that by lending a hand they can really change the environment to a healthy community.

I strongly believe that more of my peers and your students should help out with our community. By doing that it help our community prosper. Help raise students grades go up. Also, it will help our community help each other through hard ships.

By making the all of the students help with community services. It will help our community be converted into a prosperous community. Where every one has a job and to get them through this sturdy economy. All of the teens will have responsibilities and a job so they will have experience to get a job and keep that job.

It will also help my peers and your students get their grades up. This volunteering or job may count as credits or make your resume look sophisticated . So I acknowledge you to make them be part of the community so they will grow up to be successful.

You have made a perfect decision to give out community service for your students. Before there were community service, the Earth was a piece of trash. But, since people and students are taking action, they are finally cleaning the mess. Now, the Earth is becoming to clear up. Therefore we could smell the fresh air instead of the polluted air.

I believe that the students should have a choice whether or not to do community service.

Yes, it would be better if everyone helped out in some way, but we shouldn't have it mandatory. Those who disagree with community service should have a choice, because they wouldn't give 100% in everything that they do, and we would expect that from them. You also want all the students to enjoy helping the community. If they don't have fun with it, then why would they want to do it?

If they like doing it, they will keep doing it.

But, one way to get others who do not want do community service is to have them help out with areas in their interest. Such as, if a cheerleader didn't want to do community service, offer her to help out with younger cheerleaders. She would probably be interested, and there would be a high chance that she would do it. Otherwise, if you offer that type of community service to a football player, there is a low chance he would do it.

Whether it be tutoring, babysitting, or picking up trash, if anyone feels the need to do good, they will. If not, someone else will.

We should not have to do any community service. I think this because kids have other things that they need to worry about. For example, teachers give kids a ton of homework everyday. To be able to do that homework, we need time. Community Service would take away that time to do homework and study for tests.

Another reason why we shouldn't have to do community service is because of extra curricular activities. Kids play all types of sports. They have them on the weekends and on the week days. They also have to fit in the homework factor. There is not enough time in the day to fit in school, homework, extra curricular activities, and community service. We could do it if we would want to, but we should not have to. Many kids don't have the time to fit in all of their extra curricular activities and homework, let alone anything else.

We also have many chores to do at home. This also takes time away to do homework, extra curricular activities, and other things kids might do. Depending on the chore depends on how much time it takes to that particular chore.

Community Service would also take time away from being with friends. Socializing is a big part of teenage lives.

They need to be social. They also have to be active. If they don't already participate in a sport, they might be in a club so they cannot take the time to do any Community Service.

All in all, I do not think that we should have to do community service because it takes up too much time.

I believe that they should not be forced to do community service. I believe they should have the choice on whether they wont to or not. I'm sure that many of them have things that they need or wont to do in their free time. On the other hand though I believe any kids that get in trouble should be forced to do community service as their punishment. This is a good punishment because they will probably hate it and their doing something good for the community. I think the number of hours of community service should be based on what they did and how bad it was.

I believe that students should be performing community service because it would really help the environment. It does not matter if they are picking up the litter or tutoring others, as long as they are trying to help the environment.

My first reason why students should perform community service is because it would help the environment. Then if other people see the students doing community service they might want to help too. Now wouldn't that be terrific? Just seeing others help out makes me want to do more for the environment.

My next reason on why students should perform community service is because it can save lives. For example, the amount of garbage we throw out every day adds up very fast. Soon the whole world will be filled with garbage and we will not have any place to put it. Then people could get very sick from just breathing in the fumes. I really hope that you take this into consideration.

My third and final reason on why students should perform community service is because it gives them something to do. Kids often go home and just sit on the couch and watch television. If you consider having a student community service program I know for a fact that I wouldn't just go home and be lazy, I would get all geared up and go out to find someplace that might need a little more cleaning up to do.

Now please consider on getting a big group of students to help out the environment. Thank you for your time and just think about it, it might save somebody's life someday, or even today.",3,Community service,Independent

i think that students should have to perform at least two hours of community service. i think that they can spare at least two hours and if they cant spare two hours one hour will be fine to help people that need help. if they needed that help then they would want someone to help them. it doesn't even have to be a hard job it can be picking up litter in you community or helping out kids that need a little extra help in school, or maybe helping out at the senior center or if you like animals then you can volunteer at the animal shelter because they need a lot of help and you will be helping the animals at the same time who knows maybe they will even like it a lot and volunteer there full time. if i had to give up two hours of my day to help someone then i would because i might like it i think that if we do, do community service then we should get something in return not something big but something. it would be a great change in the school. i think that if you made every kid in the school do community service that a lot of people would sign up and volunteer. plus if you get all your friends to do it then you and your friends can be spending time together but still helping out other people and having fun all at the same time. i think that everyone should try it because some people enjoy helping others and for the people that don't have the time i think that if they try this program then they will start to like it and they would have never known. you should try it and see what happens i bet you a lot of people would sign up. and who knows maybe you will too. thank you for reading this letter.",3,Community service,Independent
EB2FC5321E67,"Dear Our Principal,

I believe that all students should be required to do community service. Here are some reason why I think this should happen. I will also give examples to prove and support my opinion.

First, community service gives students a chance to give back and show they appreciate everything that they have to live for. For example I help the special education class I don't ask for anything in return. It makes me feel good to know that I made someone smile I caused them joy. It also made me realized what I have and to be grateful for it. It could be a real eye opener for some kids. this again is just my opinion.

Last, doing community service also looks good on college and work resumes. It shows your involved and a good leader. Also just shows your a good person and that's what people look for. That's the kind of person that people want to know, want in their colleges, and that's who they want to work for them.

So push students into community service because it helps in the long run and isn't your job to help better students and give them the foundation to a better future. So what are you waiting for make sure your students succeed in life. Keep them off the streets and doing something good.",3,Community service,Independent
EABBB725E410,"Dear Principal,

It is a fact that most students would rather spend their time at home or out with friends, but I think that it is a great idea for students to get involved in community service. It builds character and allows students to get involved within the community. Doing community service reveals opportunities for students when they are older, it lets them see the realities of the real world, and it also puts a smile on other peoples' faces. Community service is a need for the community.

Those students who don't do community service never get to see their likes and dislikes in jobs, so it may be harder for them to find a profession in college. When students spend time doing community service, it reveals jobs a student may want to do once out of school. For example, if one likes to work in a nursing home, it doesn't mean that one is going to get a job in a nursing home, it shows that one likes to take care of people and that means that person would be good as a doctor, nurse, or anything involving people in need. When people pick up litter, it does not mean that those people are going to be garbage men or something of that nature, it shows that they care for the environment and wildlife, and may consider going into a field that involves them. By doing these things, it also gets students out of the house.

Being shown to the real world is important for any young person. Reason being that if they aren't, they will not be prepared and probably will have no idea how to deal with it other than running back to their parents for help. When having to actually have a job and work to get what one wants could be a problem for some. Doing community service could change that. Volunteering at a concession stand at the local sports fields and having to get what the customer orders, or working at a nursery and seeing that one has to take care of something and, also, having the urgency to take care of their needs could be an eye opener for some. That is where community service may be essential.

If those reasons are not good enough then i think that the most important part is that community service makes everybody's day better. For being the person who is doing the community service to the people that get to watch, people get to see that they care and that the future is in good hands since students are the future leaders, doctors, and all of those important jobs. Community service builds character and teaches life lessons without students even realizing it. Community service makes better people.

Community service is what students need to do. It should be required but not be a bad thing or another project. It should be something that people enjoy doing especially if you do it with friends. I hope that i have made it clear that community service is the way to go.

I understand that too many students, the argument of whether community service is a waste of time, or actually worth the while is much to debate. Whether or not we should be helping to plant the public gardens, or if watering those tulips is just a waste of time that could be spent doing other things. Well, I'm here too say that community service truly is important, and should definitely be required. It helps students of all ages, by getting into our community, by helping it out, and helping others out too.

One reason it should be required, is how much it helps our community! Now, I'm sure you know about the basics, like, how cleaning up litter makes a much more enjoyable walk, or how tutoring students helps them understand more. Well, how about doing things like, helping the new library open up? Wouldn't that help students understand the communities needs, help them too become more involved with the whole reading scene of the community, and hey, it might even help them too use their creative skills too get other's in there too.

Another reason community service is such an important part of the community, is of course, how it helps the community! Have you ever taken a walk in the park, and ooked around at all the trash laying everywhere, and just thought to yourself of how nice it would be without all that? Well, cleaning that up is a part of community service, so wouldn't it be great too have the students do that too make it much more enjoyable? It also gets them out there a little more.

Last, of the multiple reasons, is how it helps others. One other's see the students taking their part in helping the community, they'll want too also! Together we can make a much more enjoyable community, starting with the students.

So, out of all these reason, and more of course, why not have them in community service? It's great for everyone! Whether it be the community, other students, or skills,      ",3,Community service,Independent

91B15D1BDD98,"Dear Dr. Principal,

In my years here, I've noticed that a considerable amount of my friends have started community service, and our town is benefiting from it. The local are is a lot cleaner, and my little brother, who's class had a few tutors from our school, told me that everyone's grades were going up.

I recently heard that you want to require all students to complete acts of community service, and I think it's a great idea. If these few people are making this big of a difference, think how much our entire school could do!! I believe that with the student body helping the entire community could drastically change the healthiness of our lives. Plus, if all the elementary students who needed help had tutors, there grades could shoot up, and therefore, we'd have less failures to deal with.

While some students may not like this idea, mainly because they don't care, I, along with many others, think your idea is great, and could benefit the entire town. If you think about it, a better environment makes for better people.

I do not think that all students should be required to participate in community service. I think the students should be free to choose whether they want to help out their community or not. Even though I would recommend doing it, I disagree with the idea of making the students help out.

I know community service is a good thing, and everyone should participate in it, forcing them to do it takes away the fun, contrary to working on your own time with your friends and/or family. Also many of the students who would enjoy being required to do community service are already doing some on their own, while others who don't, probably would work very little while doing with the school.

I, for example, do community service with the scouting program, and sometimes with my family, while my friend, who isn't in the scouting program, doesn't do much service at all, and requiring him to do the service would just be more work for everyone. Plus my friend, and many others, would have a miserable time, while helping out very little.

If you require students to perform community server they are probably going to get stuck with a job they like worse than others, say one kid wants to tutor a student, and another wants to go help out at the soup kitchen, if you require the whole school to go pick up litter around town neither of the students would have a good time. The other students might have gone to do the things they wanted, had a fun time, and probably would have done a better job with that way of helping out.

Students may have something else important they should be doing, but instead they are forced to do community service. For example, a student may have an important sports game, like the finals in a tournament, but if they have to miss it to perform community service with the school their team could lose, and then they would be disappointed in their teammate

So even though helping out the community is something I recommend doing, it isn't right to require it and make many students uncomfortable.",4,Community service,Independent

I think students should have the option of choosing to do community service because community service is something that will benefit everyone.

If the student chooses to do community service, they will do a better job than if the student is forced.

I think the best thing to do instead of forcing students to choose community service, is to have a program that stresses the importance of getting involved with community service to get students interested.

It may inspire students to do community work and if it doesn't, they still saw how much it counts in our life.

Another way of getting kids involved without being required to is to explain all the different projects that can be done in their community and maybe take some of the interested ones with on the next project to see if they do like it.

If they don't, at least they tried and you may have found some other kids who would like to help.

Students will do a better and more satisfying job of the work they do if they do it on their own terms, whereas kids who are made to will probably not do their best and do their work sloppily.

They may still think it is taking away too much time and may not be responsible about their duties when doing community work.

Community service will be something everyone benefits from and will leave people more satisfied when it is done by people willing to work to make their community a better place than if it is done by someone who thinks it's unimportant and is not doing their best because of that belief.

I think you should require students to do at least an hour a week on community service because the community always needs help and who would be better to help than us students. There are always going to be people that don't want to help because they think it is a waste of time but if we don't volunteer now we are just going to be more negative about helping those in need. I think we should help the community because it is a great way to get active and help those in need. Even if donating old clothes helps it should be considered community service because it is technically helping those in need.

Another reason why we should have community service is because it promotes self-confidence and a sense of respect towards those who already help and give to the community. That is good because if you have self-confidence then it can promote you to do other good things without being told to do so (like homework). I think community service can help those in need while helping those that help the community to be better people.

We can create a list of charity events and food drives and have other people add on to that list and have kids sign up to work charity events on the school campus. To make helping out more appealing to some students we could have monthly drawings for students that did two or more hours a week to win some sort of prize. To make sure that people are doing their service we could also have reference sheets that the kids would have to fill out about what they did and have it signed by the person they worked with.

I think that requiring community service would be a great idea for students because of all the benefits to our community from picking up trash or donating clothes to starting food drives and having carnivals for children with cancer or other diseases. Our community can benefit in any way and I think this is the way to trigger the charitable acts in the students here. We have the power to help the community so will you choose to make us help or not?

Students should be required to perform community service because its helps them realize what the real world is like. Also because some kids just think about themselves so if they go out and help someone less fortunate as them then they will take a whole new look on the world.

To begin with if kids do community service it will help them realize what the world is really like. For example last year I had no plan to get a job or go to college because i had no sense of what the real world is like. but then i was involved in a little program that our school does called kids in the community and we went and did all kinds of community service, but the one memory that sticks in my mind is when we went to the soup kitchen. I was talking to some of the people in there and there plans as a little kid were just like mine.

It made me realize that I don't want end up like them without a home, family, and friends I want to live in a great big home and have a great big family.

secondly it will give the students a whole new look on the world. i know that my experience will never leave me and i will never go back to my old ways of thinking. I remember that in the seventh grade all I thought about was myself, but now all i think about is helping others and seeing what I could do for my teachers.

I think that all students should be active in the community and do community service.

I think they should because it helps you be active in the real world.

Also because it makes you active around others and helps people problem solve.

People who think the community doesn't help them is ridiculous if you didn't have a community then you wouldn't be playing sports or going to your community pool.

Also you see a lot of famous people saying "" I want to give back to my community"". They say that because their community does so much for them like encourage them and help the reach their dreams.

I wonder what kids think of when they say the community takes time from what I need or want to do.

What do the mean, if it wasn't for the community the wouldn't be doing anything.

Another reason why kids should do community service is because they are the future face of America so they need to help this country instead of sitting playing video games.

They also learn important life skills like leadership and responsibility.

If you help the community then you will lean these skills very easily.

Once kids start doing this then they will be glad they do it and be happy and feel great and also accomplished.

Kids don't know that the community really needs us and everyone needs to lend a hand or our country wont have good effective leaders in the future.

Also it is not just for out countries leaders it is just for regular people in the work fore need to help because every person makes a big difference.

The community is like a miniature world if people don't keep helping and do9iing work the it will be in a big slump just like the world can be in sometimes.

So I hope you take this letter in to consideration and please listen to my advice. Make the best decision possible and choose what you think is best.

People really need to help the community or it will not keep doing what is has been doing for decades now.

Think about how would you feel if the community you grew up in turned into nothing and everything was gone.

I don't want that to happen to mine.

So please make community service mandatory for everyone.

Thank you!!

That way they wouldn't mind working eight or nine hours a day when they get a job. the student would be thankful to because the community service would show up on a job application and help them get the job they applied for. so that would be really helpful in the future.",2,Community service,Independent

I heard about the decision that your thinking of making community service a requirement for all students. Now some of my friends were complaining but I honestly couldn't agree more with the idea. What could be so bad about simple community service? All you do is spend a couple of hours doing something that can benefit you in the near future. For one thing, my cousin is now in high school and she needs credit to graduate. Community service will help her complete her hours faster. Another thing is that sometimes you learn from the experience. And all together you have something to do so you don't somehow end up in trouble. Let me show you what I mean.

First and most importantly, for high school your going to need credit in order for you to graduate by senior year. That's where community service comes in handy. You can pick a job like maybe volunteering at the Senior Citizens shelter everyday after school for a few ours. My sister RELATIVE_NAME has been doing this since her freshman year in high school and is now a sophomore and already half of her credits are complete.

Now my moms friends daughter on the other hand is in her first year of high school. She started her credits earlier on in middle school because she wanted to become a nurse. She went to the hospital every Saturday for community service and helped take care of the patients. She would come home everyday telling her family about this and that and how she learned how to talk to her patients and make them feel at ease. In the long run you get a learning experience out of it and now she is sure she definitely wants to become a nurse.

Further more, if every student is required to do community service then it could help students stay out of trouble. After school you could be doing something useful with your time instead of doing wrong, like selling drugs or fighting. If you are required to do community service, chances are the kids will spend more time doing just that and less time laying around and looking for trouble because they'll be too busy to think about anything other then that. Other wise they don't pass high school.

Okay so its obvious I'm on your side with this and I'm sure you'll make the right decision. Those are only a few reasons why I think this should be an enforced rule and there are plenty more. I justified myself long enough and I hope I made my point clear. I'll let you get back to your job and I hope you make the right decision. Community service should be required because it helps you finish needed credits, you learns from the experience and it'll help you stay focused on your future and NOT

Some of my friends are participating in community service and some are not. I decided to write you a letter on whether they should or whether they should not. I think that we should because it's kind and it will probably get into good news when we go to college. If we didn't have community helpers I think that the community would turn bad and look disgusting and if were to get like that who would ever want to live there?

Community service is not a punishment it should be thought as way to help nature and the community. Community service should take place in everyone's lives at some point and what better way is there if we just start at a young age. Community service also matures people and make them choose the right direction in life, that's why when a teen gets into trouble and has to go to court the judge usually send them to do community service for however many hours, and sometimes the teens come out totally different because they see how they can do better things than get into trouble.

Community service has a lot of activities that we can do. And with all the different choices for everyone it shouldn't be that hard to choose one. Principal what I am trying to say is that Community service not only helps the community it helps us too, and i think that we all should participate in it. For example my friend works at the humane center because she love animals, and she does this all in her spare time. Her mom told me when she is done with her homework she goes straight to the humane center, she really enjoys it there. She is not like the typical teenager you see now, she doesn't hang out at the mall, she doesn't go to her friends house after school, and that's all because she found a community service that she loves.

Well that's all i really have to say about my opinion, hopefully I see change in the status quo. Thank you so much.

Have a nice day,

no way

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with your decision. I think students should not be allowed to do community service because it takes too much time away from us. We get a lot of homework everyday, which takes half of our time away, and almost every week we have two or three tests. We have to study, do homework, and do house chores, which takes the whole time away from us, and now you want us to do community service! We wont have any time to play and we will have to work all the time. I know that community service will benefit us in the future like in high-school, and I also know that studying is important, but not all the time. If we don't play we will look like school zombies, that always studies. That basically wont be considered life, and what life of a child is. I know and I can understand that community service is very important, but children have a busy life. Students always have to focus on studying, and reach up to their parents hope. For example, my parents want me to get 98 or 99% average, and I study day and night to make my parents proud of me, and i actually do get that high percentages, but if i start doing community service my grades will drop because i wont have enough time to study. Community service and studying is not amusing, but they both benefit us. There are many things that are expected from kids, like community service, but the problem is the amount of pressure these days on a student to A' s that test. If we don't get that much homework and tests, then i am ready to do community service. I really hope you can understand our problems, that we don't have a problem performing community service, even if we have to tutor elementary school children or clean up litter. The main problem is the pressure of getting good grades. Sorry, if your disappointed.

Sincerely, one of your best student",3,Community service,Independent

From my stance, I think that students shouldn't be required to perform community service. Sure, some students may want to, so they can if they would like. Other students may find that they do not want to, or do not have the time to.

If every student was assigned to do hours of community service, some may not be satisfied with this. For instance, all of the homework and projects that students are assigned is enough on their plate already after going to school for 6 hours. Some students may have practice, or possibly a game, to go to. Others may have a part-time job working somewhere, and would need the time when they get home to relax and finish up their homework. Every student has a busy schedule outside of school, and may not be able to fulfill their hours of community service.

Other students may not want to do community service. I mean, you shouldn't blame them; they are just kids. They need to have some freedom outside of school. Most students, in general, would be glad to get home from school, maybe take a nap, or go on the computer. Adding homework plus community service after school would just be very stressful to them. In order to function well during the day, students will need all of the sleep they can get. Nowadays, students are not able to get the minimum amount of sleep.

You may be coming to the idea that it is the students' fault for not being able to have time after school, and maybe in some cases it is. But that is how they are living their lives; it's their lifestyle. If they continue living like that, it is because it's how they mange their day. You can't just take away their joy, change how they live, and give them more duties; it would just make them even more stressed. As I had said before, they're only children. They cannot handle so much work and not enough freedom.

In other cases, some students may want to participate in giving community service. Those students possibly have more time on their hands, so doing something for the community is a good way to spend it.

Maybe a better solution would be to set up a club or organization for community service. Let those kids have the option open to them. Rewarding the students in the organization for their efforts would be an easier way to go so everyone is satisfied.

If you are not contented with the idea above, then you could ask some students to give their services on weekends. They have more time then, since it is a break off from school. Community service on weekends can possibly mean that more students would be able to participate, and the community would also be benefited.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my letter. I hope that some of the information in here has guided you into a direction of proclaiming your decision. If you do not go with any of the ideas I have suggested, I hope that you have found some useful information that I have provided throughout my letter.

I don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service.

It's a great thing to do for our community, but not everyone should be forced to do it.

To begin children would resent having to do it.

They wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment.

They would just be being forced to do it, so most people would hate it and either try to get out of it, or just hardly do anything.

The whole point of community service is to help out your community however, if you just have a bunch of kids there that would much rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose.

Instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be much more effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community.

Although it's sad that not all kids want to help out, their still are a good amount that would be interested.

All people are different, whether it's in appearance or personality.

They completely are different.

Some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video games all day and others would rather help out in the community.

It's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything but it's just not realistic.

All of humanity is different, if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they most likely wouldn't enjoy it.

Kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves.

Another very important reason, is that students are already so extremely busy.

If you put on another thing to do they will get stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do.

As students get older they get more and more homework and projects that they really need to focus on.

Not only that, is the fact that after school many people do various sports, arts, etc. that require a lot of their time.

At our age we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do, it's not always on people's list of priorities.

With already so much work and activities to do, adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do.

Also a lot of student are already doing a lot of community service.

People in SCHOOL_NAME a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours.

And also tons of students that go to church have to.

Anyone in SCHOOL_NAME (which is most middle school students) have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation.

It wouldn't be fair to add more to these kids and then others don't have to do as much.

Maybe a good idea, is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is.

Or even giving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards.

Doing this will make more kids that want to do community service come out and do it, instead of making people do it when they don't want to.

Students will have more fun if they have the time and want to.

It will have a much better outcome then forcing students.

I thing that no matter what student need to do they should help out in cleaning the world because it is out good to live in a nasty world. Many student around the world will always go out side and clean up if they have stuff to do they just wait and do it later they will rather clean up. If you want to live in a clean invirment then you will support me with this problem that I want to fix.

Like there are some places where they don't care how it looks around them and it doesn't look really good. If we could fix this by just say it to go away it would be cool but we cant we have to do something about it. And the solution is to get a group from every student from every school and clean up the nasty thing from the world. And if the student in the school have to do any thing they can wait and get done another time in the time when they finish the work they had to do. So support me and we will fix the world and make it look like it was just born.

Maybe the teachers and principals can help do some cleaning up to cause the student cant do al the work. And if they could that is not fair if they do cause they need to do some of they other stuff like practise for a sport or some thing that they need to get better at. So let get out and do the work and leave the world the cleanest posable cause i know that we can we have done better thing before.",2,Community service,Independent

I think that it is a wonderful idea to do community service in the neighborhood. But i don't think that it should be required of us to do community service. It should be whither we want to or not. Because some of the students aren't going to do it no matter what you or a teacher says.

Me I would be able to do some community service. whether it is helping someone with a grandchild or pet or going grocery shopping for them. I would be able to do that. But most of them won't do yard work or most of those things that i just said. There to lazy to do things for others.

There are some students who I think would do community service. Because they go to church and are use to do things like that. But most of them won't even pick up a rack to rack there own yard. So how are they going to do that for someone else. I really don't know .

There schedule revolves around them selves. There video games and cell phones. That is what there lives surround. Themselves and there electronics. That is all they care about. Them selves and no one else. So I think that making everybody do community services is a bad idea because your not going to have a lot of people helping out. But maybe if you make it during school they will.

So do it during school. Field trip you might get a little bit more. Make it a time when they are away from there electronics. Maybe you will get more out of them . they have to be at school any way. so why not make it fun. You don't even need a bus you could walk around and go door to door. Asking people if they need anything.

I'm pretty sure that you might get some people that need help. You could do it class by class on a nice sunny day in the summer time when we come back to school. I'm sure that people will help out if you say that there getting out of school for a day. It doesn't even have to be a week worth of community service it can be a day.",3,Community service,Independent
70419DDBEA1F,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Concerning your choice on whether to make all students do community service or volunteer. I think you should let each student make their own choice. Many people probably have things to do and people to see, so therefore they won't be able to attend the event. I can understand that you may assign everyone to attend the event because some of us can be lazy. I would prefer to come down and help with the clean-up because it would be the generous thing to do. Being able to clean-up your community is wonderful and you should be proud to do it. Taking care of your surroundings is just like taking care of your home, because it is your home. Sure, i would love to come and pick up trash, waste, and recycle a little too. I wouldn't care what my friends who didn't want to clean-up say i would go and help out my community. There is too much time in a day for you to just sit around and waste it, so get up and help out and show some respect to those who really care. To show elementary students that you should clean your community will make them appreciate this world instead of making it into a litter ball. For example, i would wanna be one of the leaders of a group as a position.",2,Community service,Independent

I think that students should be required to do community service because helping others is a good way to build character.

Doing community service makes you feel good about yourself because you have helped accomplish something or make a needed change in your community.

It is good to help people that are less fortunate than you because it shows you're caring and compassionate.

Helping people in the community will show students what other people have to go through and deal with, which will help them to be less selfish and not take so many things for granted.

I think students should be required to do around 2-3 hours of community service annually because if students have sports or other after school activities they might not have a lot of time to perform community service.

I think every student is perfectly capable of performing a couple hours of community service.

Students should do a type of community service that helps a topic or idea that interests them.

For example if a student likes animals they could volunteer at an animal shelter or if the student enjoys cooking they could volunteer at a soup kitchen.

Students may think that performing a little community service won't help change the world at all, but even helping someone in a small way can make a big difference.

Helping your community will make students better, more admirable and more respected people.

Students who volunteer when they're young are more likely to continue volunteering when they're an adult.

Then when they get married or have children they can show them how good it is to perform community service.

Students should be required to do community service because I believe it will help them become a better person.

I think that students should have to do community service. The students would help the community to come a better place. It might help the kids stay out of drugs and gangs. The students would help the environment for the community. The only thing kids about is the drugs and gangs.

If the principal made students that were bad do community service . It would keep most of them out of the drugs and gangs. I think that the principal should make kids do community service to keep them out of trouble. The community would make kids realize what they would do to their future if they got into the gangs and drugs. So i think that the principal should make kids do community service.

I think community service would be great for the students, so they can get their head off of school for a couple of hours. The principal should make the students do community service to help the city. Also to get rid of all the trash that's just laying around. Or maybe help clean up parks for kids and them to hang out on. Maybe they could help at a shelter home for a couple of hours and see what they might end up living in if they stay in the drugs and gangs.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe that children should be required to do community service because it shows that its important to help others. I think that this should be pushed on to the students so then they start to help their community become a better place.

I think that students need to be informed in the different things that they can do in their community. Such as, helping make a community garden or making a basketball court outside of school. I don't believe that most children think that they can do anything in the town to help. Therefore, if you make it required that children have a certain amount of hours in before they graduate high school, that it will help them become aware of the things that they can do. I believe that if children know that they have a say and can do something in the town, that most kids may focus more on the positive things and not negative. Such as, more kids will get together to do group projects that they will all enjoy and not doing things that could harm themselves and others. Children will be able to be with their friends and doing something good for the community at the same time.

Students also can do stuff for their school, for example starting groups to get foundations to help with the softball and baseball fields or getting new goals for the soccer fields. The kids being in group projects to help their town and themselves. Many students have a technology class that they're enrolled in, so they can make benches and donate them to the town. Students that are in different clubs can also do different things that can help, for example saving money up for different things and donating the money to different places, such as charities, cancer researchers and to the community to help with the different things that the needs to be done.

Children can do and have a big part in many things, so I believe that they should have a chance to have a part and say what they think. I believe this is why students should do community service, not to just help your community but yourself too.",3,Community service,Independent

I think it is a good idea that students have required community service hours.

Because it would give us a chance to give back to our community, help people in need, and it would give us a chance to see how easy we have it.

First off our community is good but it could be better. We have so many activities and sports events which are not cheap. But we students do enjoy them very much. I propose that we have community service hours so that we can raise money to help pay for these sporting events and buy things like equipment or uniforms, or help us go to far away tournaments. After all it is a privilege to play these sports not a nesety. By having these hours it would help our community be able to afford these things that makes our community so great. My next reason is there are people out there who don't have the things we have they don't have the greatest education, they don't have a nice warm bed to sleep in, or maybe they don't have a home at all. So by going to a soup kitchen or donating your old stuff to a group home. What ever it may be just show these people out there who are less fortune then us that we care and we want to make a change in there lives.

I think it is a good idea to make students do some community service. Some people around here need help and if we do this we could help very many families around the state. After school at least 3 times a week we can help a family or person in need.

Kids think that doing this is stupid and they shouldn't have to, but we all need to step up and help out the community. We could give away toys, clothes, and anything else we don't want, don't need, or could be helpful to someone else. Or we could send out ten people to go to every school in the county and read books to people in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade. Some of us can work in a soup kitchen whenever they are free.

Maybe sometime we can have an assembly at our school and we can hire a public speaker to tell us about how helping the community can help us and everyone else! This could be a great idea. And remember it only takes a few people to make a difference! Thank you and have a great day!

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I'm a student at your school. I understand that you are contemplating the idea of initiating community service requirements for the students to perform. In my opinion, this is a strong idea.

Community service performance is a good habit to get involved in. It can teach many life lessons such as; workmanship, hard work, taking initiative, being independent, being kind and generous and even learning different areas of help and work. Knowing these things can help anyone of any age in any area of the country with any task. community service can teach us to be better, more mature students and people. We will grow up with better life styles and we will be respected by many more. These lessons can teach us many things and with that we can apply them to our everyday lives. These skills can assist us during job interviews, school presentations, our future careers and even social events.

Community service can also help with college applications. Though we may not be old enough to be applying yet, community service can help with future applications. If we are accustomed to this idea at a young age, when we get older and are ready for that, we will have no problem completing and exceeding all necessary college application standards for community service.

Community service may not be enjoyable to everyone, but it is greatly appreciated by those around you. Many of my own friends do community service and apply that happy, kind nature to those around them. I also have friends that don't do community service and though I like them as friends, they don't like to get involved, and the ""selfish"" attitude they get when asked to head off to do something for someone else without anything in return makes community service seem more like a chore instead of fun, helpful activities. I'm not always one to jump up and say ""Hey, let's go mow someone's lawn today!"" especially not when I want to hang out with friends and hit up the mall and maybe a movie, but the good, accomplished feeling I get when I do something for someone without payment makes up for the hard work I do.

It may be a difficult decision for you to make being in the position you're in and all, but I believe whole-heartedly that each and every student, though they may not realize it, will learn a lot from this community service requirement. I think it will be a GREAT skill for all of us to have. Morals such as these will follow us through our whole lives and improve us, not only as students but as individual people.

Community service offers an opportunity to kids and adults who feel they want to do something for the community. I being a person who very much appreciate the place we live in, have decided to write this letter to tell you why community service should be required for at least 10 hours every school year. Of course some students wouldn't like that, but it would be a way of teaching them to do good not only for themselves but also for others who do appreciate and want to feel good for what they do.

Knowing that no one wants to be in a dirty or bad community, community service helps build self-control as well as self confidence. Helping out seniors in homes is a great way to help others that after so long of hard working now need a way to know they did a great job in their life and that they're being appreciate. Doing some garden help might be a big mess but it's a great way to help the community out, even at a school. Another good way of helping a student is to have them help those in need, which helps them be thankful for what they have and to not give up on their goals. I am not only saying this for the good of others, I am also saying this with experience, not only from myself but other friends of mines that have changed from the help of doing community service for their school or for another requirement.

I being a helpful person to the community and others who needs the help feel that community service is a pay-off to knowing your helpful. I believe that community service should be required because no doubt that every teacher wants a self-controlled person in their class, I am not saying that every person will be made to be caring or controlled, but they will know that doing those things do pay off when you look back and think at them. Some studies have also showed that helping out does build a self-made person with respect for themselves and others. This will also make the school look good with all the students who do help to create the community better.

I am hoping you think about my discussion and see every way that benefits the school to be better then it is. Of course you may not agree with me in some points of view, but I would really be glad if we discussed the issue, hoping we have the same views, I hope you enjoyed the letter.

I think that doing community service is a good thing and every one should do it, know i can get friends and people to help out to keep are community clean. So we don't hurt our planet, animals, and other things like our population . I think that the principle should acquire kids, teens, and adults to do so that nothing ever happens.

People all over the world should do community service because what would happen our fish die because some of us don't pick up after ourselves and the population goes down in poler bears, pelicans, and all sorts of nice loving veracious animals; because we don't make sure our rode' s, rivers, lakes, animals die so i' m saying everyone should pitch in at one time like on weekends or everyday so we don't loose a whole population because of it.

So Mr. Principle I'm saying that all people weather its student, parents, boys, girls, anybody and everyone should help pick up. know if people like bullies and rude and discourteous people don't help then they should have the right to choose or decide what they want to weather its to help or to not help, but remember if they don't or if they do they do its not our choice if they want to live in a bad or good community their the ones that want to be dirty and disgusting people not us.

Our school should have a community center. The reasons why, are so students can learn what our community needs, how to make our community better place, and why is community important for students to know. Its a great to have a community center to know how we can make things better.

Students think community center takes their time away. but they have to learn what our community needs. students will participate in a group of students making a list what our community needs, therefore students will learn what our community needs! students will present their list of things our community needs! due to that students will be giving extra credit for the ones who have low grades!

Some students don't participate because their friends say its waste of time. it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us.

some student might say why is the community important anyways, were fine nothing is wrong. but when get to know what our community is, they would want to know about and would want to participate and know why is our community important. students will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it.

so principal the community center will be a great place for students to learn lots of things. so i guess this will be a good idea for our school. students will learn what our community needs, how to make our community a better place, and why is our community important!

Because students should only perform in any type of community service if they litter or damage any property.

This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up.

Many students think that littering is a fun thing to do. Littering is a foul habit for a lot of people, most people don't realize how bad it damages our community and pollution. Many elementary schools think that cleaning up litter is very important so they take the time to help our community when they haven't done anything. So i think whoever litters should take the punishment of performing this type of action, and clean up our community.",2,Community service,Independent

I do no think students should be required to do community service. Whether or not someone helps they community is their choice. If they feel like its a waste of time it is their opinion. It might also interfere with their schedule, some students have very packed lives. From the time they get up in the morning to the time the go to sleep at night they are go, go, go. They barely have time for themselves in a regular week, so it would be hard for them to find them time to help out in the community. As for the people who won't help because they don't feel like it or because they want to do some thing else that's their choice, granted it's not a very good choice but it is theirs. They are the ones who will have to live with the choices they made in life not you.

In addition if you make it a requirement for us to do community service it may cause problems. The students that don't feel like doing it or don't have time to do it may not do it at all, and if you made community service part of our grade and they don't do it they might start failing in school because of the grades they are not receiving due to not doing community service. The last thing we want is kids failing in school because they don't have the time to help our community. I do think you should let community service be an exploratory option like art, technology and drama though. It will give the kids who do want to help our community a chance to do so.

Why put yourself through the stress of having to deal with children rebelling against it when you can just not do it. I hope you will choose what you think is best for our school, but i also want you to take my views into consideration and choose not to make it mandatory.",3,Community service,Independent

I believe that doing community service is a great thing. The world needs our help, and would do greatly with the support. Community service is a great way to keep the world and people healthy and happy. I personally think that community services are a great way to get everyone together to do positive things that can make a great benefit towards everything and everyone.

There are many community service projects that we could start doing. We could clean the communities from all the trash and glass on the earth, we could volunteer at homeless shelters and nursing homes, we could paint houses and help civilians with simple tasks like walking their dogs, raking their leaves, mowing their lawns, simple little things like that.

Of coarse we're going to need help persuading people to do these little things. We could inform them about the benefits of having a healthy world and about the things that are happening right now because of the careless acts of others. Telling people about these things will help them get an understanding of how bad things are right now and to do simple, but hard-working things can cause a great change to the world.

I understand that some people think that community service is a waste of time. We need to help them understand that the only way things are going to change are by the acts of others. We wouldn't have a lot of things if it weren't for the kind act of other people. For example, what people are doing in Haiti is a kind act of helping. The water wells that are being built there are helping the Haitians so they can have clean drinking water and cleaning water. I am sure that the Haitians are very thankful that there are people in the world that care.

I hope we can get plenty of support out of this cause and help things become a little better than they are now. Please help me get the support of others and to help me take this writing into action. I really appreciate your help and support.

I think kids should not have to do community service. I think kids that have committed a crime should be forced to do community service. Also i think that if a kid volunteers to do community service then they can, but i do not think a kid should just be told to go pick up all the trash around the city for no apparent reason.

I think that when someone commits a crime they should be forced to do community service because it will teach them not to do whatever it is that they did again. The child should be given a task and a certain amount of hours to do this said task.

I also think that if you volunteer for community service that should be aloud. An example of this is if there was graffiti on a wall in the city i think a group of kids can volunteer and paint the wall and cover the graffiti.

Another opinion i have is that you should not force the kids. What if they have things to do such as sports or other activities. Also it takes to much time for kids they want to do other things not read to children younger kids all day. I think my opinions seem fair enough and better than forcing the children.

Some of my friends are taking some of their time out of the day to perform community service. I understand that you are thinking about making community service a requirement for all students. I do not think that you should do this. Making community service a must for students could make students mad. Community service also takes time out when we are doing homework and studying for tests and quizzes that are very important and count heavily toward our grade.

I feel that forcing kids to do community service would make students unhappy and not put as much energy towards that service that they are doing.

On the other hand, community service could make students better people. Community service could also take students away from they` re treasured video games such as Call of Duty and Halo. Getting students away from these games could make them less violent and overall better people. Also, doing community service could get them out of their tight group of friends and be more in touch with the outside world. It could make them understand the point of charities and maybe the students could help the charities out on their free time.

Over all, i think that you should not make community service a requirement for all students. In stead, you could just make community service an extra-credit assignment or something like that.",2,Community service,Independent

Do you want the children to be uneducated? I know they go to school to get knowledge. But they even need extra help at home when their parents can't help them for their homework. Imagine if children needed help with their homework and their parents were not their to help them. What would they? So if someone is there to help them then the children will not have to stress about their homework. Even if they help cleaning the litter, that would make a world a better place. Our community would look good. And what's the problem if they help clean up litter, help children, baby sit. For example if the children parents are not home, and they need someone to take care of their baby, then you will need a baby sitter to do that. And what is so wrong about that.

They have lots of fun in sport a lot of people mite get kicked out of sports and not have fun at school as much. Kids will have time more after school to hangout with friends. My last reason is if less people play sports less people representing the school.

If kids at the school already have a lot of work to do then when you add on the higher grade's its just making them struggle even more. who knows they mite have problems at home. play sports to get away from them. they already have school grades to keep up to a c even when they don't worry about that they have to worry a lot on sports if they want to make the cut.

I think if people get kicked out of sports they will probably be sad and wont care about there grades anyways. i know i probably would be. If they are already depressed about something else you should add gas to the fire. so if you would just leave it a c it would help them a lot.

If we have less people in our sports then we have less people representing our school and making us know. i hope this helped you change your mind. I really like hearing and watching all the sports so please reconsider your decision.

Then however if she did change the school policy maybe some kids might like having to try hard in their classes.

First of all, those who desire to participate in extracurricular activities, which is a large portion of students, will be forced to try their hardest in school.

Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.

They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one. Second of all, students will better grasp the concept of responsibility. Responsibility is an essential factor of life, and needs to be encouraged as much as possible.

To have the responsibility of trying hard in school and getting better grades, is to value the future of oneself, others, and the world.

Your grade averages ''follow you'' onto high school, and so depending on how well your grades are, determines whether or not you could perhaps get scholarships to college(s). Which financially takes a toll off of you, because you wouldn't have to pay for tuition.

I understand your point of view. Your just trying to help students keep well grades, so they're better off in the future.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i do not agree with you about having at least a B average to play a sport.

I believe that students should at least have a C average because the sports they have keep them healthy and fit.

If you made it the way you want it, the students could end up obese or their grades might drop.

If they are to have at least a C average, they are still getting good grades and doing their homework.

Students rely on their sports to stay healthy and even though their grade are not a B average, but they are still trying and getting the work done.

I am going to be in three different types of sports in one year, cheering, color guard and volley ball. So as you see i also rely on sports but not only because they keep me fit and healthy but because i enjoy doing them.

Students all around the world are in different sports and even thought they might not have the best grades, you know that they are having fun and they enjoy doing what they do; But if you take their sports away, what are they suppose to do on their free time?

There might even be a lot more fighting and arguments because of all the free time on their hands.

If they already do their studying in a regular basis, are they suppose to just sit on the couch, eat food and watch television? Here that's what we call being lazy.

Students should have fun and its good for them to socialize.

If they are in sports, that could be a possible scholarship, even if they have a C average. You can see there progress in their school work if you let do their sports. A healthy body equals a healthy mind.

You shouldn't pressure students into doing their work and getting good grade because those students' grades can begin to decline and they might even transfer school to do what they love, I would.

Students need that endurance and a lot of strength to go through the rest of their life. So please listen to me, keep it at a C average and let students work up to a B average.

I would like to put in a nice way that my opinions are different from yours. My opinions are different because, I, myself have two C's. It is not my fault that those subjects are not my strongest. Why should I or any other students be punished for it? Getting a C is average, nothing bad. Students with a C average should be getting help from a tutor maybe but shouldn't be cut from sports.

Having sports is a healthy activity. It keeps us in shape and keeps us out of doing bad things like stealing or doing drugs. It also gets our energy out. Without sports I would be bored a lot. We also see our friends during sorts and we make new sports. Having sports prepare us for the real world by helping us meet and cooperate with new people.

Instead of taking away our activities talk to us. Maybe it's not sports that is causing our grade. It could be the teachers or our peers.

The idea have having students have a B average grade is a wonderful idea!

Students may complain about this but i think it is the best for all of us.

When I played volleyball my couch all ways said that we had to have our grades up.

That is why we are ""student athlete's"".

Hence the word ""student"".

It would be very bad if a student was failing because they were working on their jump shots or touch downs instead of their homework.

I know it is hard for a team when there best player cant play because of grades but grades should come first in a persons life!

Sports aren't always going to be there.

Being a famous sport player is not very realistic.

You have to work on your school work because you are more likely going to have a REAL job some day. I heard a story that a friend of mine had a F in math and they wouldn't let her play. Yes, i felt bad for her but at the same time I didn't.

I didn't because if she had just worked harder she wouldn't have to have gone through that. My dad always says ""work before play!""

I know students will not be very happy but it is a fact that you have to work on grades more than your athletic career!

That is when u have to keep in mind that you are the rite one.

They are wrong!

You know what is best for them, if they like it or not. So don't listen to there wining!

Give them time to get there grades up then let them in to play.

Go with your gut on what is the good for them.

Having the students have a B average grade is a fantastic idea.

I do not agree with having only B average students participating in sports and other activities. Since most students have a C average, it isn't fair to be having only B average students to participate in sports and activities. There are many different opinions that I have on this policy.

It is important to allow students to participate in other activities, not just for fun, but for health reasons too. As a growing kid, they would need to have exercise. I think it should be the parents decision to have their child play sports or not. I also think if students chose to participate in activities it could possibly help their education, the more they know the better it would be in any type of education.

Another reason I disagree is it would not make sense because there would most likely not be enough students to even participate and have full teams. That is not a good idea, because if no one can participate, that is not fair to the B average students. If most students have a C average instead of a B, you might need to work something out. A suggestion would be letting the kids with a C average participate, and below C average students could not.

A grade B is higher than average, so if you are expecting your students to get higher than a C that is expecting them to work on their abilities that they might not be able to fix. If students get a C average, they could be struggling, it does not necessarily mean they deserve to not be able to participate in sports and activities like other kids do. I believe that if this was made a new policy, it would be wrong and you should consider re-thinking another suggestion to change this.

I hope you will consider a new suggestion. Thank you for reading my opinion on the new policy you are considering.

62049767E58C,"Did you ever have a favorite sport as a child? Did you have a bunch of baseballs or soccer balls in your room? Did you ever run up to your parents asking for nothing but to play a game or basketball with you? Imagine you failed a math a test because you didn't understand the concept and your grade suddenly went down from a perfect A right down to a C. Try outs for the soccer team are next week and you really want to go. You've been waiting for it for the whole year, but then you realize you can't because of your grades.

Changing the grade requirement for sports from a B to a C is a big consideration. People with D' s or F' s obviously haven't earned the privileged to be eligible for sports, but what about people will C' s? The average letter grade for students are C' s. I think changing the average for grades to B is going to be a hard change for students.

A compromise that maybe can be done is looking at the students other grades. If a student has just one C and all A' s or B' s the rest, he is eligible for the team. If a student has all C' s, then he is probably not a very good candidate for someone who tries hard to keep up their grades.

I argue that students with C' s should be accepted on to the sports team because not everyone can get perfect grades all the time. Everyone has their moments when they didn't get the topic or were having a bad day on a test day.

What should be considered when trying out for a sports team is the effort of a student, their ability to try, and their skills. Of course it's important that students are doing well in school and that they can juggle both sports and schoolwork. For some people it's hard to maintain both at the same time and you can't always tell that from someone's grades. Students that have A' s could slip down to a D' s just by not doing their homework because they had a game that day. In that case, the students is not able to handle both school and sports.

I imagine that if the grade average was pushed up to a B to be on a sports team, students would try as hard as they could to get their grade up, but who says they haven't been trying already? What if a D student tried so hard to be on the school team, but could only raise it up to a C?

I have heard that your new rule was that students have to have a B average to play sports I disagree with this rule because first sports can keep kids healthy and not over weight secondly I believe that sports is a way to get students mind off of school.

The reason I think sports is should be a priority is because they keep you healthy and if kids are over weight they will probably be made fun of.

Secondly school may be overwhelming for some students and when they get home they just do more overwhelming homework so if they have sports to go to that would get there mind of school and get it refocused then they will be more prepared.

In consideration of the school grades policy, I believe we students should have at least a C average to be able to participate in school activities.

Most students who have C' s have them because they are trying hard to get to B' s and A' s, but are not quite there yet.

Taking away promotional activities such as Basketball or Soccer would be unfair, considering how hard they work for they're grades to elevate to the C level.

Sure, some students may stop trying if a C grade is acceptable. However most do keep trying at raising grades for other reasons, one could be the approval of parents or other situated guardians. My firm belief is that we should grant C students; the rights to Sports and other fun extra circulator events, to award for at least a good trying effort at getting bad grades higher.

I have heard that you are going to make it to where you have to have a B average to participate in sports or other after school activities I am very displeased with this and I will give you reasons. My first reason is first of all most of the school's population are only at a C

average so most people may not do sports. Another is that the passing grade level in this district is a C so if you pass you can do sports and other after school activities. Also i' m not sure it is in your power to do this i believe the school board of this county can do that not individual schools.

Now this might cause students to work harder but most students will want to focus on their sport rather than grades so they will probably get only a C average. This means the entire team of all the sports will be kicked out so there will be no point if there is no one to play the sports.

The change in the sports policy is very naive, and it will not bring up student's grades, but bring down the performance of the sports teams. Some students who are talented at sports have a hard time with schoolwork, and getting a C is the best that they can do. A C is average, and if a student is average then it doesn't make sense to punish them. I think if a child can excel at both then we should encourage them to do so, but we must be reasonable. The coaches should realize that schoolwork comes first, and most coaches do, but the teachers can't expect an average student to do better work than they can possibly do before they participate in an activity that they care about. School should be about helping the students excel in all areas of life, and extracurricular activities help them to be well rounded, and gain confidence in themselves. The students are the politicians and scientists of tomorrow, but they are also the future sports stars, artists, and writers.

It lowers the amount of players or students in each sport or activity, it ruins some of the students' dreams to become famous sports players, artists, or chess players, and is unfair.

Students should be able to join sports or other activities with at least a C average.

Most of the students have C averages so will not be able to participate in what they wish to do.

They should have a chance to join what they want to join.

Increasing the grade point average to a B average will effect the amount of students in each sport or activity.

The groups will lower because most of the students have a C average.

Also it will affect how many schools that our school will play against because we have smaller teams.

In addition it could affect the schools reputation because not many.

Other schools will know that the policy has been increased, and since there are less students the other schools and adults will think we do not give good education.

Not only is changing the policy going to affect the amount of students joining the sports or activities it will also affect the students dreams.

There are many students who want to become or may become the most famous sports player or artist in the country or maybe even the world.

Changing the policy will affect how students think about these things because they think that they are smart enough to join a sport or activity and it is not worth it anymore.

Each student who has a C average now will have their dream crushed.

In addition it is unfair to students who have a grade point average lower than a B.

Their dreams will be crushed forever.

Students will think that sports or other activities are not worth it anymore, and will give up.

Not all kids in our school have over

One of the main reasons why kids don't do very well in the classrooms, is because they don't get there energy out.

My brother has the same problems, he is always ready to go play outside as soon as he gets home and my mom always yells at him and yet he still does it. He says that he is already done with his homework when he really isn't.

My friends always say that they are doing bad in school, because they don't have any sports to let all there energy out.

I play volleyball, basketball and swimming, and I still get good grades.

The more energy the kids get out of themselves the better they will do in the classrooms.

One of the main reasons why kids have sports is so they cant be bored, I mean kids still need to have fun no matter what, but if they have a sixty or something than maybe we can punish them, but as long as we the kids have a seventy or above we still have a chance to get up and push our selves to the best that we can.

All am saying is to give us a chance to have some fun and do our best in school you never know we could be the most talented grownups when we grow up.

I hope you read this over and over and decide that we can do it.

My name is STUDENT_NAME, and the reason for my letter is to persuade you to not follow through with the sports rule such as the grades. For example, requiring all b' s and above to be able to play in a sport or after school activity. I do believe that it is a very wrong thing to do and is un fair. I do believe this is because the average for a student such as my and age and others is a c, and by you requiring something higher then such is just plain un constitutional. I also feel that by doing this you are making people look down upon them selves as stupid, because some people who try there best can only get a d or e and they might be really good at sports ,but by you requiring such a high grade you are taking away some of there rights. Also, by you making such a decision you are increasing obesity. For example , if the average of the students grades are a c by you requiring a b ,since that isn't the majority that means only a small amount of people are getting active and healthy and in shape there for proving my point of obesity. Also, its not very fair that a majority doesn't get to do this either there fore that also proves my point of being un constitutional.

B79712C5818C,"Students that don't have a grade B average or higher should not be able to participate in any sports or other activities. It can affect their behavior and school work if they are allowed too. Students with a grade C average or lower shouldn't be able to participate in any activities for these three reasons: If the principal allow them to play with a low grade average then their grades may drop even lower, students with high grade averages deserve to do fun things during school, and students who don't try doesn't deserve to get the opportunity to do fun things.

One reason a student with a low grade average doesn't deserve to participate in activities is because if the principal allow them to play their grades may drop even more.

For example, If a student has a D in all his/her classes, and he is allowed to play, he may think that the principal doesn't care about his grades, and they may drop even lower. Most students care more about sports then their grades. That's why they should base students grades on whether or not they can participate in any activities.

Another reason is Because students with higher grade averages deserve to do fun things. For example, If a student has an A in all his/her classes they should be allowed to participate in activities. They deserve a reward for all of the hard work they do to keep their grades up. If a student is doing good in classes it would be a good thing that they have an opportunity to do things other then school work.

I think the school policy should not be changed to we have to have a B grade average to play sports most kids have trouble once in a while, but we just need more help then we get now. Students just need to be passing to play sports and have fun another way to get kids to work better, and harder is to reward them with a game or a treat.

If kids don't get to play sports or games they might not work even hard enough to get a c' s it would be d' s and f' s if the students get privileges they will work harder. What the school could do is set up events for all the students to do for a limited amount of time a day like 30 minuets before lunch. The teachers can just take more time on each lesson to make sure every one knows what to do.

Events can be used as an activity and a free time thing to do, but if students decide to play sports Instead of have the activity they can get a few friends and go play the sport of their choosing. It will be good to use to get students attention and to buckle down in school, and do their work so they can get rewarded. If they have work for a class they can go into their teachers class to get their work done and then they should be able to go play if they did not get in trouble all week.

I believe that this could be a good decision but may also be a bad one as well.

Many of the students that care only for there sports or other activities and that don't do very well in school will keep up with there work only because they want to do that one sport or other activity. This might separate the people who are really determined with there academic achievements and the people who only want to play there sport or activities. The people that only want to play there sport may drop out because being able to do that thing will be just another step harder ,while the people that want to do good in school will continue to do good.

It might be a good thing as well.

The people who ,not only want to play sports or other activities but are willing to do good in school will do better in school because of the worry that they might not be able to do this anymore. So this decision may benefit the school in a way.

If the principal considers the average grade to participate in sports and/ or activities should be raised she should at least give us the reasons she feels the average should be raised. I disagree with this because it puts on more work for the student wanting to join a sport, activity, or even both I feel the student shouldn't work so hard on his or her grade just so they can participate in a sport and\ or activity.

A question I have is what if a student has a bad average then realizes that he or she want to participate in something then finds out they don't like what they joined at all. Then the student will feel that they did real hard work for nothing and doesn't like the fact that their school makes students maintain a high average just to join and participate a sport and\ or activity. I mean who knows what that student might do maybe change schools or beg parents to go into independent studies or worst of all drop out just because they don't like the fact that they have to work so hard just to join a sport and\ or activity.

B617FC07CCB6,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Sports are very important to many of our students but academics is far more important than any sport. Students need to learn to push themselves harder if they want the privilege of playing sports. Students should not be allowed to accept the minimum. The students are our next generation they need to learn how to be pushed. i am all for your change from a ""c"" average to a ""b"" average.

The athletes at our school are very talented athletically and academically but when it comes to academics they tend to slack. Athletes feel as though because they are captain of their basketball team or made the varsity football team they are on top so they don't need to try when it comes to academics...well they thought wrong. The academic average of a ""c"" for an athlete is way too low. Just how athletes are pushed when it comes the their sports, they should be pushed in academics as well. Letting athletes have a ""c"" average is saying you don't have to try because you'll make it anyways. When in fact that is not true. Athletes need to learn that if you push yourself in school you can make it just about anywhere.

Athletes aren't allowed just to do the minimum on the field or on the court so why should they be allowed to do the minimum in classrooms. Coaches tell their players to always give one-hundred and ten percent every time they go to play a game. If they do that there then why not in the classrooms?

Now one might say that not all athletes just sit back. Well I understand that. I do know that there are a handful of athletes who actually try their hardest to do well, so they might think that this isn't fair when in fact it is only helping them to do better and keep trying. You are not going to be the star of every game that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play right? Same way in the class, you are not always going to be the star student but you keep on trying until you are. Same as you do when you go to practice.

Now stop Worrying about what the slackers say because you are only helping them.

I don't agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress.

If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment's in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything.

If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldn't have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea.

I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future.

Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me.

Most of the students don't want you to change the policy of playing sports to a grade B average because there probably wont be many students in sports anymore and then we wont be able to have any sports because there is not enough kids for a football, basketball or volleyball teams and others because you have to have to have a certain amount of kids on a team to be able to play other schools.

Most students wouldn't like this idea because they wont be able to play sports because there grades are a C average or lower. If the rules got changed to a C average or higher then there wouldn't be as many students complaining about the change because most students don't get lower then a C average. I personally think we should change the rule to a B average. We should keep it the same or move the rules to a C average.

Most schools have a rule of that kids cant be failing any classes or getting into trouble like fights, detentions exc. I don't think we should change the rules at all because its hard enough for kids to keep there grades up where they are now because some kids are really struggling with them because maybe they don't get the subject that they're struggling in. Maybe in high school the principal can raise the average up to a C so kids can get better and be more independent and they can get into a good college or get a scholarship to a college that they really wanted but they couldn't afford it.

I have never heard of a school that has rules for playing sports to be at a B average I've only heard of schools having a policy of not failing any classes and not getting into trouble all the time. Most kids like to play sports and this would really bring them down because they probably wouldn't be able to play anymore because of there grades.

I hope you actually take in all this and see what it would do to other kids and show how it would effect the sports at school because there wouldn't be as many kids playing anymore. Most kids would stand up for what they believe in, and that's what I'm doing right now.

D92FAEE355E1,"Dear Mrs. Principal:

I think this new school policy is great! Students with a grade C average should not be able to participate in sports or other activities. It makes students have to earn the right to play sports and do other activities. If they don't learn in the classroom, then they won't learn on the field. Also, students with a grade C average are not that smart. They might do dumb things at the activity and ruin the fun for others.

Students must earn the right to play sports and do other activities. They can't get a free pass out of jail. This isn't monopoly, this is life. When the students grow older, they have to earn everything they get. They don't get free money. They don't get a free house. They don't get a free car. Students should start to earn their way through life starting right now. If they don't start now, then they won't start later, and they'll have a miserable life.

Students must learn in the classroom before they step onto a field. They can't play sports without a brain. To get into a good college and play on their sports team, the students first need to have a brain. Then they need the athletic skills to back it up. Also, what will they do if they don't get to the big leagues? If the students didn't learn in school, then they get to live on the streets. Otherwise, they will get a good job and be happy.

Students with a grade C average are not that smart. Some will ruin the fun for others at the school activities. For example, a student who has a D average might think that starting a food fight at a carnival to cause ruckus will be fun. They didn't have the brain to realize that it will cause chaos and bring the whole place down.

So some people might disagree. They might say that some students that have a C average are really good athletes, and if they don't make the team, then the team will fail. Well that's too bad. Like I said, students need to earn it. I don't care if the team will perform poorly without the star player. This might motivate them to do better in school, and then everyone will win. Also, some people might say that they can't do any better. Their parents were dumb, and so were they. Look at that self-confidence. Change that pattern. If your parents aren't that smart, then you become smart, so that your kids will be smart.

The new policy is a great idea Mrs. Principal. I think it will help students become educated. and it will bring the school average up. So go ahead! Make this new policy official! It will help the lives of so many students!

I completely support you new policy. I believe that education is more important than extra circular activities. The only way a person can be successful is through education. Sports my make a successful person but the chances of that are very low. Education should be the most important priority in life, and for those who are not serious about their education, this could be a good incentive.

In every school you will find a group of kids who do not care for their education and are only interested in sports. Well, if these students cannot play sports because of their grades, they will be more driven to raise them. With these students raising their grades, other fortunate things may happen. These people could become more self controlled, and easily escape bad citations, like drugs or peer pressure. If this happens then our school would be full of determined, hard working students that play sports and also stay focused on their school and homework.

In all I believe that this would be a change that will effect the school in a positive way. This will make grades the #1 priority in our school, it will influence careless students to raise their grades, and it will fill our school a school with well rounded students.

First i want to say I am feel privileged to be able to see if i can change you mind. Hoping you can pick the right decision.

Another reason why you should not change the policy would be that students may use these activities to relax and focus on other things that are not school, schoolwork, parents , friends and other things.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do and do not believe that students with a C average should or should not get to participate in activities and sports.

I do not believe this because the student is not yet failing and should still get a chance to do something he/she may love. I think that it is almost like a punishment or a bribe to the students. For example, telling kids that the only way you can play sports is to keep a B average. Another example is telling them that if you get a B average or higher you will get to play sports and participate in activities at school. A third example is saying to them, ""well you got a C on your report card so now you can not participate in sports or activities at school."" It may also not be fair to the student. That student may be trying his or her hardest to get the best grades he or she can get but still might only get a C. I don't think that's fair for the student. I can understand a student with a failing grade not being able to participate in school activities and sports, but a C, i do not think that is fair at all. The student might be really athletic and be a good player on the field and just because of a C average, why would we take away the opportunity. He or she might also have A' s and B' s in all of his or her subjects except one and in that last one have a C.

That is only one C average, they others are all great. I just do not think this is fair for the student.

Reasons that i think this is a good policy to have is because it will help kids keep there grades up in all classes and help to get OMS on the list of good schools in MA. It will also make the kids, their parents, and their teachers at school be happier. They will know that their students/children/themselves are doing great in school, they have at least a B average and are participating in school activities.

I hope you enjoyed my letter about reasons for students with a C average to be able to participate in school sports and reasons for them not to be able to. I honestly would not really care which happened. This policy is your decision and i think you should do what ever you want to do.

The idea kind of sounds unfair to others students that have D' s and F' s . I think kids with any grade point average or letter grade can participate in the sport they want to participate in. It would be really unfair to those who have the other two grades that can't participate in the sport they want to do for a school activity and for extra sports activity for their school to help support it in any way they can. Still students should have fun when they want to or not it would be fair to them if you just give us a chance to work hard and be healthy students that do whatever it takes to raise our grades to straight A' s or B' s and to achieve what we want to achieve. We want to fulfill our dreams and get a career like a teacher, pet doctor, doctor, designer, pet seller, or a famous singer/ dancer.

I strongly believe that you are making a big mistake by making the students have at least a grade B average to play in sports. If you have not noticed, there are those kids in school who are working very hard to attain the grade score that they are at now. Then there are those of us who spend so much time with sports, that we do not have time to be the best we can be in school. Of course, I realize that this is a stupid argument to make against you, saying that because of sports, students are failing. Then again you could see it my way. We are giving it everything we have to make sure that you attain a school championship. You see, those most passionate amongst us are the ones that aren't doing so well. They are trying, but they have dedicated so much time to this game that we cannot hope to achieve anything out of the ordinary in school. I hope that we can come to an agreement. Say, they must take a test of some sort to make sure that it is possible for them to actually achieve the level of scholarly intelligence that this school is now requiring. We are trying everything that we can to do well in school, but how can we ever hope to achieve our goals if we have so much constant pressure on us? We could get kicked off the team if our grades aren't good enough, but if we don't practice we might not be good enough for the team anyway!

You see, we are trying everything to stay on this team. We are either spending too much time on our homework and not practicing, or to much time practicing and not on our homework! I do not think that you should change the school policy because things are pretty great the way they are now. Everybody is getting along, nobody is fighting. The kids were fine with maintaining a grade C average. They had no problem with that. That is because at this age, when they are juggling relationships, body odor, sports, and everything else that has to do with adolescence, trying to get good grades could really stress them out. In all sincerity, it is true that they don't need to have so many things to get worked up about. They don't specifically need all the other things, but they don't care. For some, sports is all they care about. It is what keeps them alive. It's what makes them want to come to school, the fact that they will be able to play sports after it will be over. Some of these kids didn't come from great families. Some may be suicidal. Some just are not capable of getting a grade B average. Nothing was wrong with the old policy.

Now back to something that I mentioned earlier. I said something about a test. This test can be a one time thing, or you can have us take it once a semester. Whatever makes you feel better. I realize that there are state standards and such, but some kids just don't meet those standards. They try very hard to, but they can't. If you were to change the policy, I suggest making a test that covers all the subjects. Make it to see if these kids are capable of actually doing the work. Give these kids a fair chance. If you just change the school policy without anybody's consent or making it very unfair to people, people will start to get mad. They will not be happy with the decision that you made. I suppose that I have no power over your decision, but I hope that you can see things from my point of view. At least just to analyze it. I know that maybe we aren't matching up to the standards and that's why you're planning on changing the school policy, but you have to realize that some of these kids just can't make it. We try very hard. Like I said at the beginning, some of us spend more time training than with schoolwork. Others of us more time with schoolwork than training.

My opinion is that students with a C grade average can definitely play sports. They don't have to have a B grade average. A C is a passing grade therefore they should be allowed to perform in sports. They might even be really smart so you wouldn't have to worry for their future. What if school isn't really their ""thing"". By making students with a ""C"" grade average not participate in sports you may ruin there future. They could of been the new ""Michael Jordan"" or something ""big"" like that.

Students that have C grade average are passing school there is no need to hold them back in sports. They deserve to have fun too. They've been trying hard to keep there grades up to a C so they can play in sports. If you change the school policy it wouldn't be fair for them since they put all that effort before you decided to consider changing it.

Some students that have a C may be really skillful. Maybe they're just having some difficult subjects. For example, Albert Einstein didn't get a good grade average in school but as you know he is one of the smartest guy that's ever lived. I think you should give them a break and let them have fun at sports if they want to.

Maybe one of those C average kid becomes a famous basketball player or som e other sport. You will be able to say that you let them play for our school and by making that decision you saved his career. otherwise if you change the policy you practically ruined his or her career.

After dropping our grades you still decide to fallow your policy then we will slowly stop coming to school. We will all transfer out of the school and attend another school that has a sport C eligible program. Also if there is a low number of students that are coming to the school than the school board will have to shut the school down. After the school shuts down then you will have to lose your job. After you lose your job the students will beg the school board to reopen the school just with a different principal that is under a condition of not l higher the eligible average.

I agree with your idea. I have fun at school and partake in activities, and I get good grades. I couldn't see why someone might get bad grades, unless they don't bother to pay attention. I have a few reasons why I think this is a good thing.

First of all, I think raising the grade you have to have to play sports to a B would challenge some students to become better learners and actually to apply themselves. this would be a very good thing for the student, and his/her future, and also the schools reputation. these are very important things you want to do in life.

Secondly, I think that when you raise the grade to play sports, it makes the players feel more honored to play. They feel after having to do all the work, it payed off and they get their reward. When a student has this feeling it makes them appreciate what they did instead of blowing off the work, and not gaining any intellect.

Lastly, I think if this is done, it would make the C or D average slackers who don't feel it is necessary to notice the adult's authority, might become more of a mature person.

The blunt actions made by the adults could ""smack"" some sense into some students, and make them realize their mistakes.

Overall, raising the grade to play sports is a good thing. Making forceful actions and rules can make a difference on the community's kids. This action could provoke an increase in kids awareness in their grades. One small action can make a difference.

I believe that only allowing students with a grade average of at least a B is unfair. Students should be able to participate in the activities they enjoy no matter what, and they should not be discriminated if their grades aren't at the tip of the peak.

There are few sources in town besides school that these kids can take part in a sport or other activity, and taking away their activities that they enjoy is taking away their rights.

If a student has low grades, but loves basketball with all their heart, It would be terrible to take that away from them. Everybody is good at something, and bad at others, it's part of being human. A student may not have the best grades, because education may be their weakness and athletics is their strength.

I believe that in the long run, it is important that a student is successful in their future life. If someone was set on pursuing an athletic career, why do they have to have excellent grades in classes. As long as they are trying their best in school, they deserve their rights. A proper education is very important for success, but if they are the best in what they want to do for the rest of their lives, that should be all that matters.

What may improve the grades of athletes is scheduling practices at convenient times, which allow them to get all their school work completed before practice. Doing so will allow the students to focus more on their work. Another option is to cut practices shorter. If they are not as long, students will have more time to do the things they need to in order to help their grades.

It is important that kids stay healthy and active, and not allowing them to play sports is depriving them of exercise that is needed for them to grow. People who exercise on a regular bases are happier people, and of course, healthier people.

I hope you take my concern into consideration, because I know many other students who would agree with a lot of the things I mentioned.

As our school policy is now we have to have a 76% or above in all your classes in order to participate in school sports such as basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, track. We have some students in our school who are very good in many sports but are not as good in school, so they don't have very good grades. Many of us at our school think that students should have at least a 70% or above to play sports , because if you have it at a B grade average not very m any students will be playing sports because not that many students are able to keep there grades up.

Students love to play sports it keeps them entertained and out of trouble out side of school grounds, but not very many students who are very well at sports are not able to play because they can not keep their grade average up to a B average. Although many think that it is good for a student to have a B average in all their classes others disagree. Others disagree because not everyone is the smartest and doesn't do the greatest in their classes, so they are not able to play any sports, and therefore they get themselves in to trouble.

For the past years at SCHOOL_NAME has done very well in education but in sports we were not the greatest and know that we have to have a 76% or above we have gotten way better because of they fact that students that are very well in sports are able to keep their grades up to a 76% and are able to play sports. know we don't just have good education but we also have good sports and actually place in the tournaments that we have.

6FA1253A087F,"Dear Principal,

I have heard about your new policy regarding, who can participate in sports.

I believe, that making sports only available to grade B average students is a great idea.

Many students who participate in sports don't believe that it is important to keep their grades up because, they are focused only on their sports.

School sports are very time consuming and can affect a students sleep and amount of time allowed to spend on homework.

Practices after school can take away from homework time and force students to start your homework late at night.

It depends on the student to decide what is more important homework or sleep?

Having games is a whole other story, sports games are usually in the evening and if you live far from school this can prove to be a problem for many students.

By the time you arrive at your home it could already be ten o'clock and this will definitely affect your sleep.

If, only grade B average students were allowed to participate, students who participate in sports programs would push themselves to academic excellence.

With more students trying hard to succeed in their studies, the school would become a smarter place.

also, since many of the students only have a C average the will be motivated to raise their grades in school.

Our school would benefit from this new policy and the students attending would too.

I am sure that teachers would also enjoy their students working harder and participating more in class.

I strongly disagree with your positioning, this is because I myself love sports and i don't think that should be up to you if we can participate in sports depending on our grades. Also because for some people sports may help them improve their grades. My last reason for disagreeing with you is because you don't know what's happening at our house or why our grades are the way they are. Sports is like a way out for some kids and you can't just take that away due t o an average of a C. If you know most kids in your school have an average of a C then why would you go and not allow most kids to join?

It shouldn't be up to you if student participate or not due to grades you should leave that up to our parents. I absolutely understand that you want kids to have better grades and what not but still if a students parent did think the sport would make their grades decline even more then they most likely would tell them to get the grades up before joining. Disregarding sports for right now, what about other activities that's not fair to student who are apart of ski club, chess club, or any other club they all have reasons why they do what they do.

Some of the sports or activities may help some improve on grades; like myself. It gives some a sense of pride like they are apart of something great so not allowing them to participate due to an average, that's just not fair. And you are aware that most kids who try out or join something wouldn't be doing so because most kids have and average of a C. Most student don't like sharing their personal problems with counselors or things like that so they do what they like best to get away from it all. I know i keep saying ""it's just not fair to take away these things due to an average of C for most kids"" but i really don't think you understand what these activities mean to some students. It's a way to make friends, talk with friends, have fun and joke around, and be yourself. Instead they need to bring their average up one more letter grade.

Do you go home with every student at night and deal with what ever problems they may have going on? I didn't think so. So why would you go and take away something that makes them happy and expresses them self? Kids need good grades to get into college and have good paying jobs; yes we get it but. Good grade and fun activities as a reward but some kids don't want to have to go home and do homework for 1 hour at night to participate in things. The kids who have above a C average probably (not saying they do) do ALL their work and more cause they don't want to do any extra things. But that's their choice we're all different.

What I'm try to say is it shouldn't be up to you what we do, and these extra things may help some with grades and along with that is you don't know or understand what's revolving around each individual student at your school, the activities may be a way for them to escape the drama, the everything that is happening in their life at the time.

And plus, maybe the really smart students aren't that good at football, or basketball, or other sports. Maybe they have more important stuff to do then practice, like homework. That's why I think you should lower your standards, or just set a specific grade point average because it wouldn't be fair to the kids that are really good, but don't do that well in school. Maybe they just have personal issues, or something. You shouldn't exclude them from any sport activities. Maybe they'll go pro one day.

A4266A92A0C5,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing this letter today to tell you that I completely agree with what you plan to do. It would greatly help society if there was a B average policy on sports. Here are just a few reasons why i believe you should increase the grade average for sports: help teams with teaching sports, increase students intelligence, and build a smarter society.

The first and one of the most important reasons why the grade average should be raised is so the coaches for the sports team can better explain how to play the sport safely and properly to the players. With a higher average students that sign up will be smarter if they have to maintain a B average rather than a C average. Also, it can help Coaches better explain the way to play the sport and how to do things more properly and how to do it a safely as they possibly can . Lastly, it can give each team a more fair chance to win a game.

Next, with a higher average students would have to do better in school. With the average raised students would have to strive to do their absolute best in class in order to play the sport that they desired to play. It will help the students become much smarter in school because they will more than likely have to study more for tests and pay more attention in school. Lastly, it will give students less time to goof off or mess around in school or at home due to the average being raised.

Finally, quite possibly the most important reason for raising the grade average to a B is to build a more sophisticated society. I myself play sports and notice how many people actually play them and if the grade average was raise then I know that all the people I see playing sports are smarter than they were before because they had to do better in school. It would also make the kid/teenager population increase in terms of being more sophisticated. Lastly, if the grade average was raised then it would increase students smartness, but as well as showing that your school is a higher educated school and more than likely will appeal to families and they would want their child to attend at your school because they want the highest education possible.

Increasing the grade average to a B would by far make the community much smarter. Many kids at a Junior High level play sports and with the average being raised they will all be more intelligent than in previous years. Helping Coaches, Increasing students sophistication, and creating a smarter society are just a few of the many reasons why increasing the grade average is a tremendous policy.

I think having students that cannot part take in sports, unless they have a

B average is outrageous! Students express themselves in sports, B average or not. If my pupils are wonderful at sports but have a C average, and are not allowed in sports is a waste. All that talent would be thrown away if you keep the policy.

Students all want to do something that they love. It keeps there spirits high and they have a good childhood life. I wouldn't want to have a school that is always under the weather because they cant play sports. Kids need time to burn off all there energy to keep them fit and strong. Just having B average or above kids be able is not going to benefit the school in anyway.

Students need motivation in order for them to keep there school work up. If they cant play sports then there grades will drop even lower. The student will feel depressed and confused, if they cant do something that they love. To take away sports for some kids will make them feel like they have had a part of them torn out of them.

The students will work harder if they are in sports. They would want to keep there grades up in hope for a scholarship. Brain cells need activity in order for them to function right. Sitting down all day is tiring and boring. Having all student be able to play sports would also mean less fights. When you are active you burn off those emotions. Students will have a more tight schedule if they play sports and keep there grades up. This will mean less time for goofing off and having bad actions.

I am writing to respond to the idea of a policy that athletes must maintain a B average to play sports.

I am in agreement with you for the most part.

However, I do have a few suggestions.

As I mentioned before, I believe that your proposed policy is reasonable and should be implemented.

It is right to expect that students maintain a B average.

We, the students, should be held responsible for our decisions.

This policy would require more effort by part of students, which I feel is appropriate.

This makes sense because our creed if you will, VISA (value respect, include everyone, serve others, and accept responsibility) has as part of it, accept responsibility.

That said, I do propose that we give added support these students, a tutoring program.

If we add a tutoring program they are more likely to succeed.

While we do have Jumpstart, the students who go are required to go there and the others who may still need help are left out.

If this new tutoring program requires some time to set up, I would ask that you put the policy into affect next year, so that we may set up this program.

If we require higher standards we should encourage and help our students to achieve them, not set them up to fail.

In conclusion, I believe that we should have this B average policy, but that we should add a means of support.

I appreciate your time and interest in student opinion.

I believe no they should not have to have a b average

My first reason why is if you hade to have a b+ average a lot of students could not reach that so there would not be many kids participating in the school activities so if there where not a lot the teams would be un even (A lot would not have a varsity, JV team) So it would be pointless for many schools to even have sports.

One of the reasons is the average should not be in general it should be where your talking about because if you talking about inner city kids that don't have a lot to get for them self's like school work so it would be harder for them to keep up with the other schools and if you talking about higher end schools yes the average should be a b+ because they have everything they need to pass school and if they don't then its there fault for behind lazy at school

My least but best reason is that the schools should be at a b+ average are proble the smaller schools because the ratio would be easier to have a b+ school when you only have 100 kids i go to SCHOOL_NAME and we have atleast 1000 kid's and it would be hard for the few people to try to keep the b+ average up.

I believe that the policy our principal is trying to make is a good idea because, if you do not put in enough time to do your homework and study for a test then why should you be able to waist valuable study time on a sport and end up with a D or an F?

Students should maintain at least a C average to be able to play sports.

If there was a kid who got a scholarship to a college for sports, which is good, but only for sports and he failed most of his classes, where would he go in life?

School is supposed to prepare you for a good future and help you make good decisions.

Also, since only a fraction of all careers are sports related and only a fraction of people will make them, a kid should have a good education.

Also, if you were just as good as a kid at, lets say basketball, but he was failing and you had an A.

Would you enjoy it if that kid got to start and you didn't?

How about if you were a straight A student, and you made High Honor Role, then the school has an awards ceremony, and you didn't get an award, but the highest scorer on the basketball team did?

I don't think you should only let kids with a B average participate in sporting events because if the schools kids are averagely get C' s shouldn't you just have it that way.

If you take sporting events away from the kids with C' s on average then you will be taking the sport away fro your school if the B average kids only play. You will be doing that because if the schools students are averagely getting C' s then there wont be that much to make a team with and the teams will keep loosing there will be no more teams if the teams keep loosing. So that's why you should not raise the requirement to a B average or else no teams what so ever.

Also you should not change it because if you put this much stress into kids they will not be able to do assignments. The reason is say you really want to join a spot or activity but its hard to get your grade up so you try to do your work fast to get it done faster to do more if you keep doing that you are sure to not do them well and you will fail even more.

5223640D0D11,"Dear principal,

I disagree with your idea for many reasons. First, most students have a C average so most students would not be able to play even if they are the next Michael Jordan. Second, this change would nearly cut the amount of players in half so you would not have as many kids participating in sports. And third, it only hurts the school by not having as much talent on the team.

Most students in the school have a C average, so they wouldn't be able to play. If a kid has outstanding athletic ability and has a C, that is terrible because he wont be able to show maybe his only or best talent he has. Only because he is not getting a high enough average.

This change would also cut the amount of players. It would hurt the school by not having as many people participating in school sports. This amounts to not as many people supporting the team and showing up to games. For example, if someone has a lot of friends his/her friends will come to the games to support them. But then if the player cant play on the team, those friends have nobody to cheer on specifically and wont come.

Lastly, it would only be the school's loss if there is not as many players. If all of the best athletes on the team have a C average, then you don't have as much talent and the team wont do as good. Then the school team wont have a good record because they don't have all of their best talent out there.

Overall, i strongly disagree with this. I think it would have a large effect, but only in a negative way. It would take away talent, and I just don't see any good in doing this. If you can find a reason why this change would help, let me know. I will be surprised if there is a decent reason why to change the policy.

I think that people who maintains a B average should join any sports or any other activities because it shows that they can balance school work sports, and other activities People sometimes put sports first than school work, In some schools, the students need at least 2.0 gpa to join any type of sports. If they do have a C average, they should try hard to get it up to a B average. I think it seems fair that the standards to be active in sports is having a B average, because if the standards were a C average then maybe some students might not give 100% effort on their work. Also usually a C average can drop down fast. I know that many students can reach a B average if they try, and if they maintain a B average then they don't have to worry. Being in a sport is a privilege , its an opportunity but it comes with consequences. If you don't have a B average then you can't join any sports. I know a person who is in a volleyball team, she works super hard in volleyball and she still has time to do all her homework. She's only in ninth grade and she can already balance time on her school work and practicing on volleyball. She loves volleyball so if she drops her 2.0 gpa. she knows she can get kicked off the team, that's why she perseveres to maintain a 2.0 gpa. So you see, maintaining a 20. gpa. or a B average is important to get in a sport or do fun school stuffs because if they can't maintain good grades then they can't have the privilege of joining a sport or joining clubs

We definitely should not go through with this horrific idea. Your team sports will quickly lose many athletes and will probably not have enough players to even start. Many kids do have a C average that are excellent football, basketball, soccer, tennis, or softball players. Some kids can't help their learning skills as well as others. It definitely wouldn't be fare to the kids.

If I had to guess your schools athletic programs would not be very successful, do to the loss of players to the team. you will see your teams record, stat's, and even fan base decrease because of the loss of talent and depth in your depth chart. You will soon regret this very drastic decision if this change is made.

487A91198C6E,"I agree with the principal. It is important that students work hard in school. They aren't in school to play sports, they are here to learn. Playing sports is a privilege we get in middle school and high school. In my opinion, we need education before sports, this is not a right we have to play sports, but a privilege, and the point of school it to learn, not athletic activities.

Many students may disagree with the principal with having to maintain a B average to participate in sports. I am not one of those students. Students who have worked hard to get their grades up and have the B average or higher deserve the spot in the sport, if they are good enough. Kids who slack off during class don't deserve the chance to take part in a sport. It isn't fair to the kids who have work so hard for all of their lives.

I have friends who think that no matter what, even if their grade drop, they will make the team or stay on the team. No coach needs that student that badly. It is not something you just get to do. You need good grades. It is a privilege to play sports. If the students really want to participate in them, they need to work harder!

School is a place of learning, not sports. Yes, sports are a part of school, but it's not the main focus. The student education is what is most important. We need to keep it that way. If the principal gives in to the students who think it's okay to have under a B average and play sports, then the rest of the county will think that we don't care about education. They will think all we care about is being good at sports. That is not the reputation we want for this school.

The principal needs to stick with his rule. Playing sports needs to be earned. It will teach students to go for what they want, and really work. Kids should know that not everything is his or her right, some things you must earn. Education comes first, other things come second. A great thing about needing good grades is, if you really want to play that sport, good grades look amazing on college applications.      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
490C899F285D,"to principal students have now been informed that you are considering changing a policy that will not allow students with a grade below a B to participate in a sport.

this kind of policy will not be a good change to the school mainly because most of our students have a C average but that is not failing.

students should not be allowed to participate in a sport or activity only if they are failing one or more classes.

also that will allow more students to participate in a sport/activity. this will also benefit the school.

Another reason not to change the policy the students need the exorcise to stay on task-forces during the school day.

by changing this policy that will have less students participating in a sport/activity so less students will be fit and on task during the school day. kids on and average day need a lest and hour of movement having sports/activty more available to the students can really benefit the students health. also discipline students need something to do after school in the winter allowing there be more flexibility in the grade average. more students will be getting into less trouble with police and there parents. because they'll have something to do.

sports/activitys also allow students to talk to each other and make friends. socializing is needed to get to know people and also make friends. socializing is also a part of being healthy you need to interact with other people and get ready for the real world. so by working on your people skills know is important sports/activtys can benefit that.

E125A0E0FD41,"I believe this would be unfair. Students need sports so that they can get exercise. Not only that, if students sat inside all day doing homework, reading, and playing video games, they would become overweight and depressed. Sports also allow students to develop a social skills so they won't be lonely or even worse made fun of. Childhood obesity is already at an all-time high. Plus, I believe school already has too much control over our own lives, they try to tell us what is good and bad and what we should and shouldn't do. Students and parents should be able to makes decisions that are best for the student.

Sports are a good way for students to blow off steam from everyday life. Life is hard as a teenager, peer pressure and other things make it even harder. Students are pressured to do well by their parents, and as a reward for succeeding, they get to play sports. If they don't succeed, parents have the right to take sports from them, but not schools. Also, it may be the schools fault for failing student. Some schools don't have sufficient enough help for the student, or the teacher could not be doing their job correctly.

On the other hand, middle schools with their own sports programs can do this. If the student has a failing grade, they could be placed on extracurricular probation. But for middle schools without sports programs, such as Cobb County, this would be unfair, because they would be controlling too much of your life outside of school",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
0BE6935B5A54,"Dear principal,

I feel it would be right to have the students have a B or above average to play sports and other activities. If a student would be forced to make better grades to do what he/she wants to do it would bring the school and their grades up. Most students like other activities way more than regular school work. But if they would be forced to make better grades to do those activities I think it would help them better themselves. That way the student would get used to keeping their grades up instead of being given an ultimatum.

This would probably affect other things like the students behavior and attitude. The way it would help their attitude is if the student has to pay attention to his or she work they wouldn't have time to goof off and get in trouble and disrupt class. Another way it could help improve is the school's grades if the student kept a b or above average at all times it could improve the way it looks on the school.

The students would also be helping themselves by keeping good grades which could give them more possibilities ahead.

If the student kept good grades which would enable them to participate in activities they would become more well rounded. If the student was more well rounded it could pave the way for them for a better education. With a better education the student could get into better colleges they normally would. This would all began just with a student being forced to have a b or above average just to do the activities they want.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

Dear Principle,

I have heard that you would like to change the grades needed to participate in sports. I have a few arguments and points that I would like to bring to your attention.

Point A: I know that you would like students to have good grades, AND be able to play sports. Well, as an athlete I know how hard being on a school team can be. You have practice everyday, games are far away, and you still have to complete your homework and maintain your grades to be at least a C. Some of the best athletes are sometimes not so great at school, and if they get a C, are you telling me that you are going to take away what they ARE good at? Let's say for one week they get a C+ which is an 83-84% average, one-two points below a B, are you still going to take them out of basketball, or tennis, or whatever sport it may be? I can understand you taking out a player if he/she has a D, that's different, but for a C? In my opinion, that's a little unfair.

Point B: By raising the grade to a B, you may actually take away motivation, not instill it. They could either decide to not play, they could quit because they think they can't do it, they could switch to a recreational league, or they could sit the bench by choice of not working. By having a C average for your requirement grade, they will feel better about getting and maintaining that grade.

Point C: If many students at the school have a C average, they know that they can maintain that grade. If all of a sudden you raise the average to a B, you are not only going to lose kids that are active in sports and other groups, you are going to have kids that might possibly lose interest in school altogether. With all respect, it would be a stupid decision to change the grade. Here's another thing. For some kids, its ALL about activities and sports, and if that's taken away from them, they are going to lose interest even more than they already have.

Point D: Have some school spirit. If you take away the athlete's chances of being on the team just based on having a B or not, then you are taking away pride. Think of it this way, you take away the good athletes on the team, equals your school losing games, equals lower school pride, and the athletes' self esteem goes down.

I would really love you to consider not doing this policy, because of the effects it could have on our school. Thank you.

I believe you should be able to go and play sports if you maintain lower than a c. I believe you should because some of the teachers give us way to much homework like this one teacher she gives us a packet to do every day. Also i believe you should be able to play if you don't turn in your homework. or miss a day in practice because you are sick i really do believe if you get lower than a c grade average you should not be able to play also because some people just cant not get there grade up in science or math but its one thing if your failing a class and are trying you should be able to play if you are trying and getting help but still just don't get it.

With people averaging a B and above there wouldn't be many people that could do sports. Most kids have a C. A c is okay to have. It's not failing. It's passing. There would be many more people if you let them have a C. It may even make the team better. I think they should everyone who's passing there school work do sports. it would almost be like a reward for passing. They definitely shouldn't be able to participate if lower grades.

I think that students should not need to have an average of a B or better. A lot of kids that play sports have a C average. I think a B average is a little too high of an average for some students. Instead, I think that kids should have at least a C average. Having a B average is too high for some students because lots of students have at least Bs and Cs. So their average maybe on the lower side of B or maybe a high C. I think that if students get lower than a C average, then they can't play on a sports team. I think that because if they don't try in school then they don't play on their sports team. School comes before sports and if they won't try in school, then they shouldn't be able to play a sport. Playing a sport is an opportunity for students. If it is abused, then it should be taken away from them. Also I think that kids who have a C average or better should be able to play a sport because getting a C is still a good grade. Even though it's not the best grade, they still try in school. But if a student doesn't try and gets lower than a C average, those students shouldn't be able to play. It's not fair to the students who want to play and get the good grades. But I think that the students with lower than a C average shouldn't get kicked off of the team. I think that the student should be able to get back on the team once they get a better grade average. It may take some time, but if they really want to play, then the student will work hard to get their grade up.

I would like to advise you of many student's responses, and argue amongst the possible policy of requiring at least a B average to participate in sports. As i am sure you are aware, many of the students already participating in sports with a below B average, are dearly upset. School work can be tough at times, and everybody deserves a chance.

The policy "" You must have a B average to participate in sports"" should be abolished. Many sport members participate to earn scholarships, physical health, and a source of entertainment and gratitude. It has been reported that many of my fellow classmates have been grieving over this new rule. Most of them have a ""C"" average. 70%-79% What if someone was just at the near cusp? This could be intriguing to many who just barely didn't make the grade. Yes, i do know it is tremendously important to keep on your grades at all times to be able to succeed in life, but when your this age there are more important things.

The many advantages of outdoor sports. This provides the chance to believe in yourself that you can succeed in anything you participate in. It makes you think bigger, and lets your imagination run wild of all the possibilities that can be accomplished. Sports also allows participants the chance to be physical and active. This guarantees that you will learn healthy habits, as well as staying fit. This gradually can decrease the national problem we are facing in modern day; Obesity.

The issue obesity, needs much more attention then it gets. This is something that really needs the help of the American society. But why? Why are so many children obese? Lack of physical activity and healthy lifestyle habits, that's why. Studies show that if you participate in school sport activities, you are guaranteed to be healthier and fit.

Most students grades are falling below a B average. For some, they are just barely passing! Why would you take away the benefits of sports away from children of our society? We all know good grades are very important, but i believe as long as your trying your

""Personal Best"" Then you should at least let students participate as long as they have a passing grade. We very dearly appreciate all you do for our school. We all know you try your best to do as much as you can for us, but sometimes it goes over our limits.

I do think it's fair to let only B average students play sports or other fun activities because have they do their work and focus a lot in school. If you let some with an F average play, it won't be fair to let him play than someone with an A average. F average students don't really care about school or doing their work, because of sports and activities; they focus too much on other things than school. On the other hand, students with a good GPA focus on school and on what they have to do. Most coaches i know would much rather prefer someone that's an average player but gets good grades, than the best player who has low grades. If you don't have good grades, it won't get you anywhere in life, except maybe working at a fast food restaurant making minimum wedge.

One thing i do disagree on with you is the B average. I'd think at least a C average student is worthy of playing or doing fun activities. I know they may not be the smartest people but they might have potential to start doing better in school. If I was the coach, I'd keep that C average kid on check with his grades, and as soon as they start dropping, I'm going to kick them off the team.

I myself might be around like a C average student and will do better in school. My dad won't even tolerate a C- because he says it's pretty much a D. Both my parents have me on check and as soon as they hear that I was misbehaving, or not doing my work, that's it, no more sports, games or privileges to out with my friends until I pick up my grades.

But, all I'm asking for is to let at least a C average student play sports or activities in school, they might be perfect A+ students, but most try hard to do their work, and deserve a chance to participate in extra-curricular activities.

The school policy should not be changed. Students should only have to get at least two C' s in order to not be able to participate in a sport. The reason for this is that some students do not like a certain subject because they're not good at it.

Another reason is that, maybe the advanced people aren't very good at sports, and the people whom it takes more time to learn something new are good at sports? the school wouldn't have very good teams with people who aren't good at sports and maybe the advanced people would rather study more than be in any kind of sport. i would be delighted if you took some time into this and had some thoughts, thanks for your time.

I don't think that is a right thing to do on our benefit because we try. We as children or teens do our best hoping that you will accept it... but our best is not enough? students have a grade C and cant participate in school activities I don't think that's a way to run a elementary school. I don't think the school policy should change.

If students don't have daily activities like sports and things how do you expect them to be physical and active during class. With out activities how are students going to stay in shape. their are more reasons to support this. Like students cant have physical education and they cant have any sports team. What parent would want to send their child to a school like that.

The students need time that's all. The principal of the school needs to have patience with the students of that school. If you were to give it some time then maybe the grades will go up even higher then expected. Children of our age group work at their own paste so give them a chance. Don't take away the school activities and the grades will get better.

In conclusion, it is not the right thing to do if you decide to take it away. Different school are getting better because of patience. Also some schools are getting worse because teachers and principals are being hard on the students. Don't take the activities away it would work in the beginning but in the end it will be a mess.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

I have heard of the idea you've developed on how a c average determine wether a student has the ability to play sports or not. I do think that grades should effect student's athletic privileges, but that is if a student fails a class or multiple classes. Failing deserves no privileges and a c average is not failing. A c average is between 70 and 79 and failing is 69 and below. I do not think that the idea that you came up with should be enforced on student athletes. I think if a student athlete works hard enough but still does earn grade of a c in a class they deserve to participate in sporting activities because they still put forth all of their ability to pass the class.

I also don't think the idea should be passed because i just finished up basketball season and towards the end of basketball i had a c in us history class if the idea you have would have been passed i wouldn't of been able to finish the season with the team and help win our last game.

I do not agree with the new policy. I find it unfair that students with a grade C average are not allowed to compete in school sports. I think it should be up to their parents whether they should play or not. The school needs to know that getting a C average is normal. C stands for average, B is good, and A is Excellent. Sports are for exercise and they help you stay in shape. Some of the reason that we have obesity in America is because schools don't let kids that have bad grades play sports. In college your grade point average needs to be above a 2.0 to play sports. That is reasonable.

In middle school your grade really isn't getting recorded. Colleges do not look at your middle school grades. They actually don't start looking at your grades until high school. In high school they look at your grades and sports. In middle school they don't look at anything. There is no reason that we should not be allowed to compete in extra curricular activities. That is what colleges want to see. They want to see what you do out of school. They don't want a misbehaved late teenager coming to their school to disrupt class. Some kids are like that, they are very smart in school but they misbehave during class and get into trouble at home.

Sports also keep us out of trouble. Which would you rather us do, play video games, get fat, and do drugs, or would you rather have us stay in shape and be well behaved. I think you would rather have us be well behaved. Sports are fun, school is not. You wonder why it is so hard for us to concentrate and do well. Its because we are so pressured into doing well that it makes it no fun. Sports are fun because you get to relax and not worry about school for just a little while. We have way more school than sports, can't you give us a little freedom. It isn't like whenever we aren't playing sports we are studying or doing homework. We have extra time to play sports, why can't we use it?

I agree with your decision that you have to have a B average in school to participate in sports and other activities. There are a couple of reasons why this would help the school and the students become a better community.

For one it would set a higher standard for students, which would make them try harder in school. Athletes that would want to play sports would then put academics first and athletics second, which is important.

This would also make it so that the athletes would be determined to strive in both school and sports, which makes for better people. Plus people that want to play sports but don't have a B average, would realize that you have to try hard at something to earn something rewarding. Students are led to believe that a C or even a D is okay, but it will not get you far in life, so this project will help kids realize how much more they can achieve and accomplish with better grades.

Another reason is that this would boost the overall GPA for the school and get the school more recognition. A lot of middle school students want to play a sport (or sports), at a young age and are also encouraged to be active by their parents and their community. So if a lot of students want to play sports and be on a team they also want to have good grades to be able to play on the team. If the school had a better overall GPA it would get more recognition and awards from the community and the students would get more rewards for their academics and their athletics.

So therefore I agree with your choice and I think it will help the staff, the students, and the community to become a better place.

I think it is great that you wish students will need to improve there grades to do sports but, some students are not capable of getting up to a B in their average. I have decided that you should give them work do to for extra credit.

This would be a great way for students to participate in sports. If they refuse to do the extra credit then have them raise their grade on their own. Another thing i think would be great is if you could hold an after school tutoring class for them after school. Also if they refuse that then i guess they wont get to try out for sports.

I think if you don't give these students a chance with this opportunity they wont be capable of ever trying out for sports unless you go for this decison. The extra credit or tutoring will help improve their grades so they will have a chance in an activity that they are interested in.

Once the students have improved there grades with this opportunity and don't try hard to keep it that way then you should not let then volunteer in this sport. A good thing about this decision is that they are doing physical activity and that is a good process for a child to have.

I am arguing with the principal by playing sports or activities unless they have a B average. I say this because a C average is satisfactory. Which is not really good. If students want to do sports or activities and they want to get a B or higher, this makes the students work more harder to get up to a B or higher and play sports. So it is putting pressure on them to work more harder. The students have the privilege to participate in sports , it has to come with requirements. Also by changing the policy , students will have a good grade and they are doing sports or activities. They will not have to worry about there grade a B instead of C or lower. This will make students achieve higher and make their school very proud of getting A' s and B' s. The students will have good confidence about your grades and being on the sports team.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand that as an experienced teacher you may see that many students are making a C average, but does that really mean that you have to take away our sports and activities? There could be many young athletes that you don't even know exist, therefore you should not take away the privileges of young future athletic scholars.

These sports also could relieve stress for some of the students. By you taking their ability to relieve stress away they may even do worst in school and you're going to wonder why. I believe that students who score at least a 75% should attend sports, but by making only B average attend is not fair in my eyes. These students may have a lot on their mind minds as far as school comes , but there are athletes sitting right in the classrooms not doing anything , BECAUSE they cant attend any athletic activities.

I do understand that as a principle you may see something completely different. Just think about if you were a student, how would you feel if you got the only thing you love to do taken away because you have a 79% percent? This is why I argue that students should be aloud to attend any sport they'd like because they have a 75% average or higher in all of they're classes.

All in all please consider not making this a required rule.

Not having exercise isn't going to make us do better on our grades! Being healthy helps us focus, eat better, and concentrate more on our grades.

It wouldn't be fair whatsoever. This is uncalled for, just ripping away exercise to kids who need it, but have extremely low grades! You should be ashamed of yourself for even considering not letting kids have what they need! Sure lot's of people say you don't NEED exercise, but honestly we all do actually need it. We need to have the running, and strength that our gym teachers provide us. And just forcing it away because of lousy grades, which we can fix easily, is just cruel!

Gym helps build muscles. When you take it away because of grades, not only are you letting kids become obese, but you are also taking away what strengthens them. Their legs won't be any good because they will be too weak. They can hurt themselves when they finally get good grades and randomly start exercise. They need to start from the beginning like everyone else to build up strength like everyone else. Don't take away what we need the most.

Don't take away what we hold dearest! We cannot help it if we aren't good in math or algebra!

Dear Principle,

Hello. I have recently heard the news that you are thinking about not allow students to participate in sports unless they have a B average. I think that it's a fair policy and I could not agree more with your thoughts.

I agree with you because many students that play sports as a middle school student will most likely not be a professional athlete, due to the very tough competition. Therefore, I believe that students should have at least a B average in school, so that later on, if they decide they are going to quit sports, they will still be able to succeed towards the academics side. If they only focus on sports from an early age, but later realize they're not good enough to be a professional, their futures of getting jobs will most likely to be difficult. No matter what job a person receives, they require some sort of basic skill in any of the subjects taught in school. So in case they don't succeed as a professional athlete, I think it's very important that students receive good grades in their education today.

If they start to earn C' s and other below-average grades starting from middle school, there is a better chance that they will most likely do the same in high school and college. I believe that whatever they major in college, there is always some sort of education involved. And what kind of good parent doesn't want their child to go to a college and become successful? Students should start to bring their grades up now, so they can start getting into the habit, that will help them throughout the rest of their lives.

Let's say that students who are involved in sports right now, do become professional athletes in their future. Even if they do, the basic skills of subjects like language arts and math are still needed. If as middle school students, they decide their careers as athletes, if they don't have the basic skills, I can guarantee they will have problems, even as an athlete. You will need your reading skills for situations like signing a contract, or math skills for when paying bills or counting up your money. Even as an athlete, you need the basic knowledge, so I think it's important that a student has these skills and properly learn them when they have the chance.

As you can see, education is very important, regardless of what activities a student is involved in. It doesn't matter where that student decides to go in their future, they will always need the basic education. I believe that students should raise their grades up before they regret it in their future, so I hope you do change the policy, for the better.

Is there some way you can change it. If you don't change it many students will be disappointed. Many students already told me that their parents are thinking of calling and unless you want to be getting phone calls all day by mad parents I would say you should change it. For many students sports and after school activities is what keeps them out of trouble. Also parents sometimes can't pick up there child/children after school and this gives parents time to pick them up and something for their child to do after school. Its another way student interact with each other. Most students become friends by doing stuff they have in common. This is a good way for students to try and get there grades up but for some students school is hard for them.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
54A7A2CF8D60,"I don't agree with your policy change idea. I'm a student with a grade A average, but I highly disagree with your policy change idea. Most of the kids won't have the opportunity to join an after-school activity because the average grade is a C. Some of these kids only try to get at least a C to join a club and raising the bar is most likely to make those kids stop trying. Kids won't be able to pull off both and we will be left without any sports teams or anything else. Do you want that to happen? Yes, academics are important. But, some kids can't do that well and depend more on after-school activities to get a good career.

Many of my friends here at school say if you raise the bar, they will try to go to a different school. Some would still be able to play out of those kids and some wouldn't. If you raise the bar, you will lose students. Other schools will take them in and win all the different sports and debates while our school can't even PARTICIPATE! That will become detrimental too this school. Parents will send there kids too every where else and take there kids out. The school will eventually be shut down, and you will lose your job.

Please don't raise the average grade requirement, because it will only ruin everything. Letting kids in with C' s is better than not having any kids to let in. Don't change the requirement and everything will work out fine. Kids will participate in after-school activities and you can keep this job. It sounds like a win-win situation to me.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
03990A4F67B4,"I do not think that changing the policy would be fare. I don't think so because some kids are in honors or advanced classes and they get C' s even though they try really hard. Also if your in honors classes you get a high school credit because your taking a high school class. So you are going to want to stay in that class if you have just a C wich is still a passing grade! But if your in a hard high school course you shouldn't be excluded from physical activities for having a C average. Even if your in just advanced classes and you try your best but your best just isn't good enough. That policy should just go for kids who are in normal classes and behave badly, for kids who have gotten referrals, and that are just plain trouble makers. That is when they should check grades because if your bad in class you are bad everywhere, and you need to be responsible and trust worthy to be in sports.

88990A944CC0,"Dear Principal,

In the policy containing that students should not have a grade C average to participate in school sport programs that they enjoy or any other school related activities should be changed to having a grade B average.

If you allow them to be apart of something they enjoy and care about then they shouldn't have a grade C average. Students that do what they enjoy and care about such as sports and or school activities should care enough to make the good grades for those activities. Being in those activities and sports is a privilege. Not something that is just given to you. They should care enough to make the required grades if they really wanted to play that sport or activity. Let the student know that they should have better grades in order to play the sport. It's up to them to get that grades to play the game or be in the activity. If they want to continue playing the sport or activity then they should get the grades required such as a grade B average. By telling the students that they should have a grade B average lets them know that they need to work harder to succeed. By working hard to get what they want is a great experience for the student so it teaches them to focus on whats important and be responsible for there work and what they care about. Later in life they may not have much trouble doing what needs to be done and getting it done with ease.

The policy in my opinion should be changed to the requirements of having a B average in order to play school sports and participating in school activities.

7AA48CB7269C,"Dear principal, i think that changing the school policy is not a very good idea. Most kids have a C or higher, but just because they don't have the grade required, doesn't mean they cant participate in sports. Many kids don't do very well in school, but sometimes they do sports to get their mind off of things. Some kids are very fanatic about sports, and that's what they like doing. Maybe they even want to have a future that has to do with sports. But not letting them do what they like , just because of not having a B or higher, is not a good solution . And if they do a test , and she/he didn't do well, they just lost their ability to do what they like. Some kids think that sports is their life, and that is the only thing that matters to them.

Another reason why you should let kids participate even though they don't have a B or higher is, that the United States is one of the country's that has they most obesity in the world. And some of the kids need that exercise to try to maintain fit. and just because they don't have the accurate grade for it, is not a good idea. So i hope you will change your mind, by the ideas that i have given you. And try to think thoroughly of the decision your about to make.

CF2400A27FF1,"Protest

I would all the students that love doing sports to join the protest or the boycott with me and see what we can get out of it but sometimes it probably because of the money like the schools don't have enough money and they need more money because there a lot of kids going out for sports and they have Fs and but they still have the money to join the sport in there on the sports team for the whole season and they have all Fs and your coach don't know about it they are a really good player what would the coach do that's how I look at things but there not good and not going to practice they wasted there parents money then your parents would get really mad at you and sign you up for any sports anymore.

But if your really good and you make good grades you belong on the team but you can't make the practices that's showing the coach you don't want to get better and that's really bad and if you just show up for the meets or games your not going to face because you cant go to practice that's on you and your about to get kick off the team your giving up and your saying that you quite because of the coaches.

But some coaches don't care and just kick you off the team and be like bye cause your wasting my times and your time.

I would not like that because what if your whole entire school is really good at sports and there best in state for any sports and people that are the best they cant play because of there grades is what keeping them back so they would have to work on there grades and they have to ask there parents for extra help ay for more classes for they can be on the team they want and have a good season but its always school before sports because you have to make the grades and you will succeed on what your target is at school",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

I am a fellow student who is against you for changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

A few reasons why is because if you did that then our school wouldn't be so fun.

Another reason is because our students wouldn't be able to develop as much team working skills or they wouldn't be in to good health.

My last reason is because it keeps kids off the streets and keeps them out of trouble.

An example of my first reason is that if I were going to school I would actually want to have an activity or sport to look forward to.

Instead of making the qualifying grade a B average it should be a C average.

Then the students would have to get mandatory tutoring to help bring up their grades.

They can go during lunch or recess so that it wont interfere with their activities or sports.

Another example for my second reason is that by being in a sport or some kind of group activity it helps us develop good team work.

It can also help out our school get more publicity for all of our good athletes and smart kids.

And finally my example for my last reason.

By being able to be in these activities it keeps kids out of trouble and off the streets.

This can help out the community a lot and hopefully change their ways or bad habits.

That way we can have better students.

All in all these are my reasons of why you should not change the school policy so that students with a B average can't be in any sports or activities.

I hope you take my views into consideration.

Teachers are a big thing that helps you in a class or tears you down in a class. If you don't understand the teacher or don't understand the class or even don't get along with the teacher then that can change the way you work and act in the class. You could only be missing a B by 1 or 2 points and that means you cant play any sports until that is a B average and sports are important for some kids. I believe it should be determined by your homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Sports are important to some kids and all but they have to be abill to do good in class as wail as in there chosen sport. In personal reference i am pushed to do good in school and i am unable to do sports until i bring my grades or grade to a passing average. That's one of my family's rules no sports if there is not all passing grades on report card. I personally know many students that live to play sports and come to school to play sports and they try their hardest in class but don't always achieve their goals in the classroom so that means they cant play.

I think that it is a very good idea to change the policy for athletes to have at least a B average in every subject. I think this so because it will give the students more pressure to do well in school as well as to become more responsible in life. In addition to this it well be good for the student body to know that making good grades will pay off eventually.

By having the policy change into having a B average in every class will help the students to feel the pressure into having good grades. If they have the pressure they will pay attention in class, do homework and , improve the schools as well as the students test scores. Making the students smarter and more confident.

In addition changing the policy will make the student body more responsible in life. It will teach to have responsibility to have their assignments done on time. Turn in homework when its due. Thirdly to finish class work in class. All this is very important in school.

Also this will tell they students that everything is important not just the sport or sports that him/or her may play. By pushing them to have higher grades will give them opportunity to get scholarships to go to college to play their sport and to have a backup plan if they do not become famous athletes in their life.

Hello! I hope you are having an amazing day! I would just like to let you know about how I feel about this new policy to not being able to play sports with less than a B average. Some people may agree with you on this and some may not. I would like to let you know that I do think the students of our school should try harder on their school work and actually care. But I also think that we should continue to let our students play sports even if their grade is less than a B average.

To some students it may not seem like a big deal, but to others, it gets their creative thinking going. Others it is a way to relieve stress. I have many guy friends that play sports, and to get out there every once in a while a throw a football. Well they have told me that it helps get their minds off of all the stress of life, and to make them calm down. If we just suddenly get rid of that some people might have a stress overload!

You never know what struggles and challenges some of these students go through. And sometimes sports is their last resort to feeling better! Yes, I agree that if students don't try at all in school then they should not be allowed to participate in school sports.

i agree with your suggestion of requiring at least a B average because if you do then the students will have an extra incentive to bring there grade up from a C average to at least a B or who knows even an A, also i think that you should do this because if you do then the students will bring there grades up therefore making our school seem better in academics.

firstly, our students would be studying like crazy if they knew that they had to keep there average above a

B in order to stay on there sports team, because students need to do there sports because they need physical activity and competition out side of p. e , this is there incentive for them to study more frequently student will study more frequently which will bring there grades up from classwork and tests and they will keep it up there because thy know that if it drops then they will get kicked off the basketball/baseball/vollyball or whatever they choose to participate in. according to sports illustrated 90% of schools who require a B average to stay in sports have shown an increase in there schools average. in addition to that they would be doing so well on tests that the school average would go up therefore making the schools academics and the school overall look better then the other schools and our past history of academic grades i don't know about you but this sounds like a pretty good idea to me to conclude my letter i shall say this i believe that the raising of the average for sports inside of our school would be a great idea because it not only benefits our school but it also benefits our student body in total",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
2B53D5D29EAE,"Dear Mr. Principal

The idea of making school policy that you have to have at least a grade average of a B is a good idea, but you would have more of your star players ineligible to play because of grades. Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes i would encourage this but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all of the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possible shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it and those who don't fear us in an athletic category. I believe though if you must make this a rule, then you have to get the ones who aren't as smart tutors or someone to help them get the grades to play their sport. For other activities the I can see where having an eligibility grade of at least a B could be a good thing like ski club, that's something that you can do by yourself bu the school provid

In conclusion I believe that it could be a good idea if our school was known for its grades but because it's just the opposite, we need to keep the eligibility level at a C average to maintain our reputation to those outside of school and those who may be thinking of coming to our school.

Well, you already know me, STUDENT_NAME, i just wanna say that even though people have low grades (in the 60's] or a C average they should still have the right to be in any sports or activity they want to be in, because they want to be part of something in the school activities. & by the way, people will try to put their grades up if they want to be in the sport they like, but if they don't even try to put their grades up to be in the sport/activity they like then why bother having them ?

Well, what i' m trying to say that the ones that should stay in which ever activity they want are the ones that really want to part of it, try to do better in class, does their work/homework everyday, participates in class everyday, & try's their BEST & not the ones that are not even trying to put their grades up, not even doing their work in class, or not bothering to do ANYTHING.

Trust me, MOSTLY everybody wants to be in a sport/activity but they cant because they have C average. You should give a chance to the people that really want to be in something to actually be in what they wanna be in ! :D

What should be a ""rule"" for every activity is that the student should:

As you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.

But there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.

If these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.

11D36CD1AC96,"Dear Mrs. Principal, I strongly believe that you should not put the policy of students needing to have at least a B average in order to play sports. I feel this way for a couple of different reasons. First of all, students that don't have good grades need to be able to play sports in order to keep them in school, and secondly many kids that have learning disabilities such as ADHD play sports, but can't keep their grades up.

Playing sports in school entices kids to go to school for the chance to play on the team. Many kids only go to school because they can play sports, and they know that if they stay in school and are good enough at their sport, they might get a chance to play at the collegiate level, and maybe even the professional level. Those kinds of kids don't really care too much about their grade, and playing sports makes school bearable for those kids. If they had to maintain a B average, most kids would drop out of school at the first chance they got, not try harder.

Secondly, some kids with learning disabilities love to play sports, even if they can't get good grades. Kids with ADHD or dyslexia could be very talented or just love to play sports, but wouldn't be able to if they had to keep their grades at a B. You would be robbing those kids of an opportunity to win the school respect, and an opportunity to make friends along the way.

Sure some kids would work harder in order to play, but I can almost guarantee that the majority of them wouldn't. It is much fairer the way it is now, where if you have two D's or one F, then you can't play until you bring your grades up, but it is simply unfair to expect all kids that want to play sports to maintain a B average,

6.15E+11,"Everyone should have an opinion on what they think is right. Congress should change the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The Electoral College contains of the selection of the electors and there is a meeting of electors to vote for President and Vice President. The popular vote shows what citizens want, lets people have the freedom to choose who they want to be president, and have a better result.

First of all, the popular vote shows what citizens want. It tells the government what they are doing right or wrong. For example, if people say they want a democracy, that tells them that they want the right to speak for themselves. They want the freedom of speech that they deserve.

Furthermore, the opportunity to let people make a decision of who should be president for their country. For example, when people were voting for Obama or Romney, Obama had the most popular votes. That shows that the citizens trusted Obama in representing our country. They liked what his plans were going to be and trying to help us with our problems.

Lastly, it provides an accurate result of who should be president. It gives the percentage of how many people actually voted for the person that is going to be elected for president. For example, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and 51.3 percent of popular vote. The votes show that people wanted Obama to be president instead of Romney because people like Obama's future plans.

In summation, instead of having an Electoral College, it should an election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Popular votes helps the government understand their citizens better. It lets them know what people want from the government, allows them to have the freedom to make a choice of the president, and gives the government a picture of how many people liked a candidate's plan for them. All in all, popular votes would make elections for the president a lot better to understand.                     ",3,Does the electoral college work?,Text dependent

Hi, this is one of a student from the SCHOOL_NAME. I am writing this letter to talk about the policies our school is having. The policy that i will be talking about is the cell phone policy.

I think our school should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, but as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Because we have busy students, their parents will be calling them to inform them on what they should do. I agree, sometimes students do get carried of with their phones. But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this. Students do want to text with their friends, and they can because sometimes school gets boring, but I think that instead of focusing on what to do with the phones, you should focus on what to do with the classes. The reason students text during class is because the class isn't interesting enough. What I noticed is that more people text in the ""boring"" classes then in the ""fun"" classes. You don't need to confiscate the phones, let the students keep them, but if the classes are better, then the rate of students using phones will decrease. Also if the work is to hard, students might text some answers to each other, so don't make the work to hard either. I'm just saying, its your decision. I also use phones, and I love to text, but sometimes play games or text other people when i get bored and sometimes I get texts from my friends asking me what the answers are to a problem or something like that.

Students should be allowed to bring their phones at school and use them during free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. Some students need to have their phones at school with them. If you allow students to use phones during free times they won't try to sneak to use their phones during class. Phones are sometimes a necessity. They can be used in school responsibly and turned off in classes.

Many students participate in after school activities. Sometimes these practices or club meetings can be cancelled or delayed. Students may be stuck waiting for hours with no one to call if cell phones are not allowed at school. Students need cell phones at school for extracurricular activities.

If you don't allow students to use cell phones they will just use them behind your back. They will hide them and use them during class. If you allow them to use cell phones during free times they will use them then and not during class.

Some of these people need a phone for emergencies and taking them away could have a negative affect on these students. Students can be trusted to turn off their phone during classes. Although teachers should be allowed to take these phones away if they see them or hear them during class. Some of these students will be driving in a couple of years but you can't trust them with a cell phone.

Taking away phones could do horrible things to your school. Cell phones are a necessity in some students life. You need to trust your students with cell phones. Consider allowing students to use their phones during free periods.

Students like using their phones, but usually don't know when to turn them off during class. There are many times when their caught using the phones during class or other free time. While in school you may see students walking the halls and maybe some have a phone. Should you not allow anyone to use the phones or should they?

When in a class most students are talking to others by texting them from another class. It's harder for the student to do any work and also to bring their grade up if their failing. It's easier if you wouldn't allow them to use the phones during the class time in fact not allow them to use them at all. Even if they had free time they should finish their book or their homework.

Try watching them more often to make shore they don't turn them on they should be aloud to bring them in but not aloud to use them at all. If you see someone use the phone take it from them and give it back at the end of the day. If they continue then take it and tell them if they don't stop they'll never get it back again. If the teacher can't stop it or if you can't tell the parent about it and talk to them. Tell them everything that has happened each day their child has used their phone. If their not satisfied they might take away the phone from their child and only allow them to use it when they are in need of help.

Talk to the students in the school about using phone safety they maybe talking to a friend or someone that claims to be there friend, a student that may not like them. If none of this helps then ban phones from the school and only allow them to use the office phone if a student needs to call someone.

Should you allow them to use the phones? Well no, it may not be so bad a first but once they start getting out of control it'll be harder to pull them away. They should be banned and not allowed, even I don't bring my phone and never need to use it. They should get used to not using them in awhile.            ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

If the principal is considering a new cell phone policy there are a lot of things she should know. If she has a policy where students can use their phones during lunch and nution' but during class would be great. Many kids would enjoy coming to school because they can talk with their friends but when class time came they would have to turn off their phones. If the other police that phones ant be used at all wouldn't be good.

With no phones kids would text during class when the teacher isn't looking. They would be loosing there education and the teacher would be planning a great assignment and no one would be listen. They would be unaware of what was going on in class. If the teacher tells them you have a test this day they wouldn't know when to study because they were so interested in their phones.

If they had the police that phones could be used during nutrition and lunch a lot more kids would like that. They'd like it because they can socialize with friends while they get an education. That way they can just reply to their friends when class is over or if the class is having free time they can talk to their friends. Many students say they are going to the library to get a book when they get any book they put the phone in the book and do whatever. That is wasting their time and someone who actually wants to read the book. They think the book is being used for good things when its not.

2514C0AD2026,"To our principal,

I fully support ""Policy 1"" on cell phone usage and completely against ""Policy 2"".

I believe that students have a right to bring along a cell phone and carry it on themselves as long as it is not a distraction or disturbance to the learning environment. They should be allowed to use them during instances allowing them.

If they are seen with their cell phones out while a teacher is in the middle of an important lecture, unless he or she has gotten permission from the teacher it shall be confiscated immediately. When there are times allowing cell phones to be used, if a student is caught giving answers to a test or talking to someone in class, their phone should be taken up. One thing that bothers me is students cheat using paper all the time but teachers only get upset when it is done over cell phone. I think it's the same information, just being transferred a different way. There is no telling what students say to each other, using notes or cell phones. It could easily be on both. If a student's phone is taken up for them talking to someone, why do teachers not take up paper notes being passed? They are doing the same action, only on a different device.

I also believe that cell phones are a good way to contact someone outside of school. Let's use someone left their lunch at home for example. It would be easier to let your teacher know and to have them allow to contact their parent via cell phone in class than to have to get permission to go down to the front office, ask permission to use the phone, and then call. Also, some people use their electronic contact book and don't memorize numbers. The school may have your house number on file but they don't have your parent's work number or cell phone number. It would be better to contact them using a number they can recognise. Some people don't answer to numbers they don't know, even with the exception of caller ID.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
DD71BE46AFE9,"I believe that students at any school should but should not have the right to use their phones during any free time that they have and should not allow them to be seen during school at anytime. Phones cause can cause a lot of disruption and problems while using them at school. But, they could also be good for emergencies.

Some reasons how phone the can cause disruption is by going off in class during any kind of important event. They also can cause problems if something bad was going on like a lock down or something it would make noise and that might cause someone to get hurt. Phones would keep the students off task and keep them something focused on the phones instead of what is being said or what is suppose to be happing.

Now I'm not saying that it would all be bad because phone could be a good use of resource sometimes. They would be needed for if something was wrong like if the school was on fire and you didn't have any thing to use you would need your phone. Even like if your mom or someone important was calling you at school to tell you something important it would be needed.

Phones can still be bad for school because if there was a problem or fight is about to happen the student(s) could call others up there and that up cause a huge problem and put everyone in danger.

I think that the policy should be policy 1: ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."" I think that because then students would not be as tempted to sneak there phones in class and text. It would allow them to say what they need to, to who ever they are talking to at the time they are allowed to have their phones out. Then they would not wont to take their phones out during class to text that person as much.

Plus, what if there is an emergency at school? The students could get their phones out at the right time they need to, to call there parents or gardens. This would make it easer for the staff at the school so they wouldn't have to call all the kid's parents or gardens. You never now when there might be an emergency at the school and you would have to call the parents. So the students having cell phone would be able to get a hold of their parents easer.

Those are some of the reasons I think you should change the policy to policy 1: ""Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.""

Cell phones are not necessary although they are being depended upon too much in today's society. I believe students should not be able to use their phones during the school day. I think you should stay with policy 2 because cell phones cause fighting, not everybody owns a cell phone, and these devices are distracting.

When you wanted to tell your best friend a secret, didn't it annoy you when you had to wait until nobody is around? Well now with cell phones people can just text the secret to their friend so nobody gets hurt right? Wrong. Most people realize when their friends are talking behind their back. If they find out you said something horrible about them they'll probably be as mad as bull that was just let out of his cage. Now your best friend won't talk to you or even be around you long enough to explain what really happened. If she finds out what you sent and it was either something you were told as a confidant or something bad about her then it may even get physical resulting in one or both of you being suspended. All of this could have been avoided if you never sent that text message during lunch.

It's hard to believe but not everybody can afford a phone payment. When a poor student sees everybody on their cell phone it makes them feel left out. Studies show, 67% of fighting is caused by jealousy. Nobody likes being made fun of because they don't have the latest ""in"" clothes and definitely nobody likes being teased of for their lack of a phone. Even if you have a phone it may feel disintegrating when people have the brand new iPhone 4 and you're stuck with your moms ten year old flip phone.

Although the rule is no cell phones during class, students still text and look at their phones while their teacher is teaching. Typically, there are students who don't want to be at school and they think since they don't want to be there nobody else does; but they're wrong. Learning is hard when you hear the buzz of someone's cell phone going off every five seconds. When you hear the noise you can't help but wonder who they're texting and what they're talking about which distracts you from the lesson you are trying to learn. Facts prove, when cell phones are not in the classroom the students averages increase dramatically opposed to those who have cell phones ringing all the time.

All in all, I hope you enforce policy 2. Banning cell phones from being used during school will decrease the amount of fights between friends, eliminate pupils from being looked down on for their lack of a cell phone, and help students focus better during school. No one will die if they are unable to text for a couple of hours. Weakening the dependency on cell phones will make this world a better place.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent

4FFE43F4135B,"Dear Principal,

I think both policies are phenomenal but, I most likely agree with policy number 1.

I agree with policy number 1 because I think students do have a right to have some time on the phone, but only on their free periods. Hence, what if something happen at home or something happens to any of your family members and your mom or dad calls you? This will count as an emergency call because, you have been called to get a dreadful news. What if something bad happened to you and you have to call your guardian saying that you have to go home because you don't feel good? Anything can happen in the moment you don't expect it. These can be some reasons to why

I think you should bring phones to school.

This are some reasons to why you could bring phones to school, just as long you have them turn off during class time. Only on lunch periods or free times you could use your phones because, you might want to spend some free period on your phone. I agree that you should turn your phones off during class because, that might be a distraction for you and your classmates, but on free periods or lunch time you might as well use your phone.

C0635735705B,"Dear Principal,

I have heard that you are going to change the cell phone policy at school. You have provided two options: allow students to use them during lunch and free time, but not during class, and not allow students to bring phones to school at all. Out of these two policies, i believe that policy 1 is a better idea. I can list tons of reasons, but here are just a few.

First off, policy 2 is a bit harsh. If students aren't allowed to bring cell phones to school, what happens if they're in an emergency. Also, phones are a way to communicate with friends and family, about how their day is going, or sometimes you're bored and you want to play a game, well, cell phones have that. I agree that you shouldn't be able to use them in class because they can be very disruptive, but taking them away entirely is just not right.

Secondly, I completely agree with policy 1. If students are allowed to bring them to school, and not use them, then I don't understand what the point of it is. But, when they pull out their new cell phone to show off to their friends in the middle of class, that could be a problem. One, it's distracting to people around them. It can make them look at the phone instead of their work, and then fall behind or get in trouble from the teacher. Also, the phones could ring in the middle of class, and that's a problem. The noise can be loud and disruptive, or the ring tone or whatever they have as their ringer could have inappropriate language. Who knows what's floating around these days. And finally, they can use it to ask for things. What if someone forgot their lunch that day. They could call up their family and ask if they could bring it to school. But, only during those lunch periods and free times.

My last reason is that during those lunch periods and free times, it can get a little boring. Especially if there is no recess because of the weather or some special thing that is going on. With the cell phones, you can do numerous things with your friends during those boring times. You can talk to each other. Also, on some phones, you can take pictures, or record videos and then laugh about it later. There are also games that you can buy and play on certain phones that can entertain a crowd. Aside from those things, sometimes if you get internet access, you can watch videos on certain sites that made you laugh, or had some good music in it with a cool video.

So, between policy 1 and policy 2, I would choose policy 1 all the way. It's better than policy 2 in so many ways and just has good ideas. whether it's calling up your parents to tell them to have a good day or ask for your forgotten lunch, or just talking to friends about what's going on, cell phones are a good thing. So, principal, it's your choice to make, but I hope you make the right decision on this dispute. Thank you for your time.

4ADD9D52FC2E,"Cell phone policies are always an issue in schools around the U.S. In my opinion schools should ban cell phones. Me being a student myself I know exactly what students would do. Students would have the temptation of bringing their phones to classes which don't allow kids to have their phones, they would be a cause of distraction, and detract from a child's educational time.

Kids spend more time on their phones than studying. If phones were allowed in the school during free periods kids would be more likely to bring their phones to classes that aren't free periods. This would cause more kids to face consequences with the administration. If kids traded their phones for books kids would be more educated.

Phones are distracting and everyone knows that. If you were to allow students to have phones during the day it would cause more distractions within a day that don't occur already. Phones are always an issue and will always be an issue. As a student I need to practice what I preach because I am one of those kids who need to trade my phone for a book.

Besides being distracting the phones would also detract from someone's learning. Instead of concentrating on school work kids would be focused on when they would get to use their phones. It would most likely lower kids' grade point averages. It would be an even bigger issue for the country then. So why not stop it now.

Although it would be nice to have the privilege of having your phone during the day, I am against having your phone during the school. Many kids would object to my response but phones are tempting, distracting, and detracting.            ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

I believe that you should not allow kids to have pones in school because students will get distracted in school.

Even though students will only be allowed to use their phones in their free time in school, I believe that they still will use them when they are not supposed to.

I also believe students will say that they are done with their work just so they can use their phones to text and communicate with their friends.

If their phones are in their lockers turned off then they cant use them and will not be able to get distracted by other students with their cell phones and will not be tempted to text their friends.

Students may also have games on their phones so if they have them in their pockets then they will have them in class and most students are not guaranteed to have their phones turned off so they will most likely play games and not focus on work.

These are some of the reasons why I believe students should not be able to use their phones in their free time at school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
87A974F87B12,"To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME;

Of the new policy of cell phone, students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, and to be also used only on free time periods like lunch.

The reason why students should bring their cell phones is because students can use them for emergencies and other uses like calling their parents to pick them up after school. If phones are used in class, they may get a warning or be taken away by the teacher. When taken by the teacher, they may receive their phone after the class period.

When an emergency happens, Students can call their parents or call for help when they are instructed to do so.

Calling their parents can let them know that they are all safe from a natural disaster. Either it is a flood, earthquake, tornado, etc. Students letting their parents know that they are fine shows the responsibility they carry.

Calling parents after school can let them know what time their child gets out of school. When not having a cell phone, certain students have to use the phones in class and/or the ones in the office. If so, they may or may not be able to get out of school on time. Parents always have to make sure they leave on time to know what happens at school and after school.

Having parents to know that their child is doing good in school means that their parents are happy that their child had a grea

The last reason why phones should be brought to school is because that students should enjoy a nice school year. Having a great school year for students means that they can memorize all the times they had for the year. Letting them know they had fun is that it leaves them with a happy day. It can make kids happy for themselves and the people around them. Also it makes friends closer with one another when they talk about their day.

This is why the policy of having phones ay school for emergencies, parent pick-ups, and the excitement for students.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
C17FBC33DB34,"Cell phones are an important part of the 21st century. Many people don't leave their house without one. Over the years, cell phones have evolved so now people can not only call someone from almost anywhere in the world, they can text message them, play games, use the internet, listen to music, and even watch television. But cell phones still have one main purpose: communication. Sometimes, that communication comes in handy or could even save your life.

As for in school, there are situations when using a cell phone would be inappropriate, of course, but there are so many more when it could be necessary. What if a student's bus broke down on their way home from school, and they had no way of reaching their parents? The parents would be very worried when their child didn't come home at their usual time. With a cell phone, they could be informed of the delay immediately and arrange for a pick-up or make appropriate considerations for the time delay.

Or what if the child were to be in danger? Going to school, while in school, or coming home from school, anything could happen. Contacting a parent or the police could save lives. Or on a more simple level, if a teacher needed to contact a child's parent or other adult, chances are the child has all the necessary contact information on their phone. Addresses, phone numbers, schedules, nearly anything can be accessed from that little device.

Cell phones are also important for scheduling after-school activities. Many times, at the last minute, a friend has invited me over after school, and I've had about 2 minutes to get permission and make a decision. Calling my mother took only a few seconds. If I hadn't brought my cell phone to school those days, I would have missed out on many fun times. Also, while on the bus, sometimes I get separated from my friends, and have no one to talk to. My phone is my entertainment for the 15 minute ride.

And while students are in school? Cell phones generally aren't a problem. If a child knows the phone may be confiscated if they have it out during class, they won't take the chance. Those phones will be off and away. However, cell phones can encourage communication between students during times like lunch and other free time. What harm could a mere cell phone do in between classes or during down time? Minimal. They could do much more good than bad, including contacting parents for forgotten papers or just for keeping them updated in their child's life.

In conclusion, banning cell phones from school would do more harm than good. Cell phones are so useful in a number of situations including on the bus, during down time, or after school. Students need their cell phones.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent

I heard that you were changing the Cell phone policy at school and that you haven't picked witch new policy yet. In my opinion i don't think that cell phones should be allowed at school because they can get stolen and are a distraction.

My first example is how a cell phone can get stolen. Most kids bring there cell phones to school and take them around with them, like my friend RELATIVE_NAME. RELATIVE_NAME did not have a P.E. locker last year; So she shared one with her friend. One day she had put her phone and ipod into the locker and left it there over the weekend. Sadly her friend had forgotten to put the lock back onto her locker. The next Monday RELATIVE_NAME came back to get her Phone and ipod. Both had been stolen. RELATIVE_NAME was devastated, Also like most teenagers she was obsessed with her cell phone. Her parents weren't very happy Also.

There was another girl that i knew when i was in sixth grade. At my other school we did not get lockers at all, We all had to carry around back packs.

One day her phone drooped out of her pocket in P.E. and she had no clew where it had gone. All her friends helped her search for it for days. Luckily for her a student found it and turned it in.

My Next Example of why we should not be able to have cell phones at school is because they are a distraction. Last year There was a class that i was in where the teacher let the kids text or listen to music while they worked. The only bad part was that none of the kids worked. And the kids like me who were trying to work kept getting distracted by all the talking, clicking, and the blasting rap music coming from there phones. It gave me a headache. I couldn't stand how much noise was going on and so i did not get much work done and i almost failed the class. One of the student in my class also got enjoyed and told the guidance councilor what was happing. The rest of the year i was able to work in peace because the assistant principal kept coming in to make shore that there was no moor craziness.

To sum it all up, i think that cell phones should not be allowed at school because they are very distracting and can get stolen at school.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

Have you ever, when you were a teen, owed lunch money, and you need to call a parent to drop you off money? This example leads me to believe that policy one is the better choice because teens, and children should be allowed to have their cell phones out at free times such as study hall, lunch and after school hours.

What if, the school policy was that you couldn't have cell phones out at all! How would you be able to eat lunch if you owed money and you couldn't eat because of it?

Also what if you had an emergency and you needed to call your parent immediately and you were not allowed to have a cell phone out at all (policy two )! I believe that students should be allowed to have their cell phones with them as long as they are off in their bag or pocket.

But, this does NOT mean that they should have it out texting, only if an emergency approaches and it is strictly needed. This is why policy one is the superior choice for the school.

If there was something to go wrong at school, you should be able to call a parent or guardian . If you consider this, there should be some rules set into play. The major rule would be to keep your cell phone in your book bag at all times in less there is an emergency.

You should also tell all the teachers that if they catch any student messing on a cell phone for no reason that the cell phone will be confiscated until a parent or guardian comes and gets it. I have thought hard over this policy and i hope you will to. I also hoping to will consider my opinion.

They can cause disturbances during class time when a student is called, the lack of social interaction when a student is constantly texting with a friend and lots of the time a loss of focus in his or her studies when a friend calls to inform that their is something better to be doing during a study session.

Students often text or have phone conversations during school hours.

In the end cell phones also can get students in trouble when another student calls them during the middle of a seminar.

I'm a student at the school and heard about the two policies you're considering to use at school. Me and my fellow classmates suggest you choose policy 1. You and all the teachers should let use our cell phones in school for personal reasons, to call someone if an emergency at school happened and the power is out, and to help us study. I also understand that we will not be allowed to them in class and that is fine. Almost all of the students in our school use their phones for personal reasons.

A student who could be allowed to use their phone for their personal reasons would be a relaxed student. They can play games, call a friend who is away, or call their parents for something they forgot. It may also stop the them from being disruptive in class by texting. With this personal time though, some one may decide to spread some rumors. So, students should try to control themselves before they take it too far and lose this privilege. There may be a situation where something bad happens at school.

Once in a while an emergency happens at school, but what if the power goes out and the phone lines are down? Students could use their phones to call someone to pick them up. Everything would be organized and everybody would get out safe and sound. Some people may freak out, but I'm sure we're mature enough to handle it. Students tend not to study for a test.

I also feel that if we got to use our cell phones during free time, cell phones would be less of a distraction in class . Simply because we've already got to use them at some point of the day.

I feel that the rule , ""we can't use cell phones during school hours"" is sometimes reasonable . But at other times its not because i always see teachers using their phones. So why can't we? Its not fair even though we came to school to learn we also have the rights to socialize. I think that's one of the most important things you can learn now. Social skills is very important in , job interviews , college interviews, and in meeting new people .

Maybe if we had more interesting subjects we would be less worried our phones or less tempted to use them.

Even though we're becoming young adults i still bealive that we should stay young as long as possible . And what better way to that then having fun in school because that's like our second home.

I know that cell phones cause problems in schools because kids use them in class. Sometimes they have to text their parents if they are sick or something but sometimes it's just for the fun of it. I do think it is a problem and it causes a lot of distraction, not only for the person using it, but the people around them and the teacher also. I just don't think you should make a rule saying we can't have them.

One reason is because if a child is picked up every day and they need to know who is picking them up, they would have no way of knowing at the time. Also, if you are a bus rider, your parents might want to know if you are on the bus and made it home. Those reasons concern parents too, not just the students. Another reason i think cell phones shouldn't be banned is because if you say a student can't have it, some people take it the wrong way and they just want to go against it. Some of the kids i know would just bring it to school anyways just to do what they said not to. There are really a lot of kids like that. I personally don't use my phone at school because i don't want it to get taken up. I just use it after school because I'm a car rider, but i still don't want a no cell phone policy.

I don't think it would make things any better, and students would probably just be offended by it. If phones were allowed to be used on our off periods and at lunchtime, i think it would make students less likely to use them all day long. You see, if we get some privileges, i think it would be good enough and we could hold out on breaking the rules. There would most likely be a lot less kids using phones in class if we could use them some time of the day. So i say you should go with the first policy! These are all plenty of reasons why i think the first policy would be better. I'm not just saying this to get my way or anyone else's for that matter, but because i honestly think it would solve the cell phone problem better than policy two, the no cell phone policy would.

F3C4A0CF4AC8,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to discuss with you the new cell phone policy you are thinking of making for this school. I think you should let us use our phones during lunch and free time because we could then get in touch with our parents if we had to. Another reason is that if we needed the homework for something we could then contact a friend. The last reason is because this would give us something to do during x-block or lunch if we don't have anything to do. I would like you to please read my letter to consider the idea.

Cell phones should be allowed at lunch and free times because if our parents needed to contact us for an important reason then we would be able to. For example if one of our family members got injured and we couldn't use our phones then how would we know that. Or if your parents couldn't be home for you after school and you had to go to a neighbor's house you wouldn't know. Having phones available to be used during lunch and free times could definitely benefit communication with our family's for important reasons.

Just say you forget your homework for Spanish and you know a friend in another home room has the same teacher as you, instead of getting up and walking their you could text him an ask for the homework. I think that this could improve the percentage of completed homework assignments. I know that I sometimes forget to write down my home work in my planner so if I could text someone to find out what it was I could get it done. I know that your probably thinking you can do that after school, but if you have many activities like me you will be really busy, and might forget to ask.

My final reason is that sometimes you have no home work and just sit around during x-block and talk. Some teachers don't like when you talk and get mad. If we could use our phones then we could talk to each other, but it would be quiet, so the teachers can't hear any noise. I'm not saying it would be one hundred percent quiet, but it would definitely make a difference. Having phones at x-block could definitely keep kids busy and maybe even out of trouble.

I conclusion having phones could really impact our school in many ways. It could keep family's closer if they are needed and maybe even help kids get homework if they forget it. This could maybe help bring up the percentage of homework assignments completed. This could also keep kids busy if they have nothing to do at x-block. Keeping kids busy at x-block could even lead to less kids getting in trouble. Thank you for reading this and I hope you considered my reason.

I am writing this letter to support mine, and others' choices to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them whenever free time is available. Such as lunch time, you don't have to work on anything, or pay attention, it's your own free time. I think it is the perfect opportunity to use your cell phone.

Another great opportunity to use your phone would be between class periods. Let's say, that your mother is coming to pick you up early from school, but doesn't know where the front office is or where to sign you out. That is when you would call or text your mother and tell her where the front office is and where to sign you out.

Finally, a great opportunity to use your cell phone would be when you have advisory. Every single day in advisory, all we do is read or do worksheets, but what about when we are done with those books or worksheets. That would be the perfect time to use your cell phone. If you have an emergency, if you feel sick, if you have a broken bone, anything. Even though the nurse is there, sometimes she doesn't let you go home. Therefore, as a backup plan you could use your cell phone to contact your parent or guardian. I hope you take into consideration, my choice to allow students to use their cell phones during time that is available. Thank you for your time.

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing on behalf of the cell-phone policy. I think cell phones during passing periods would be great because if a student needs to talk to someone on the other side of campus while walking to class, a cell phone would be a perfect device for such a problem. I also agree that they be turned off during class. Not only a great idea, but a way to keep students interested in school.

Having only 45 minutes of class and 8 periods a day with 3 minute intervals is plenty of time for someone to get where they need and enough time to talk to someone quickly on their cell phones, or during lunch. If a student's mother needed to talk to him/her they could easily call during lunch time. Or any relative or friends. They could inform the student about family troubles or if they were coming to pick them up later on, for a doctor's appointment. I think that only 8th grade and up should be allowed this perk because 7th grade and below wouldn't pay attention where they are walking or pay attention to someone administrative walking into them by accident. Then the cell-phone policy would become too strict and if someone needed to call their mother about a family emergency they would not be able to. just because some isn't walking in the right way could harm the whole grades chances of being able to get this treat.

If someone were to spoil the chances of this treat for everyone else then i think there should be single punishments for offenses from certain students. If a student has a repeat offense then they should be punished by themselves. If someone were to mess up for the first time then they shouldn't be punished unless it was serious, but also speaking, what if administrators were to run into a student, they should be punished, by a $15 fine just as well as anyone else, including students. I think that cell-phone usage at passing periods and lunch time would improve student morality about school.

I am writing this letter because of the new cell phone police decisions. First off i want to say each choice is very different from the other. To not allow cell phones at school is pretty harsh and we students have a right to have them as long as they don't disrupt class. So i am asking you to please consider ruling in favor of policy one. First it would allow student to contact parents about important information that they learned during school so they don't forget. Second there would be less temptation during to use them during class. Thirdly when there is less disruption we will be better able to study when are temptation for cell phones is gone.

You may be think well that's good and all but i could just ban cell phones and all those problems would go away. Well if you did there would be mass anger towards you and there would be more and more breaking of the rules more detentions and there would be even more using of cell phones when in class.

So in the conclusion of my letter i thank you for taking your time to read it and i know you will make the right decision for all of us.

Because it would be nice to chat to anther friends that go to a deferent school, and it would be cool to chat to other friends on the web from your phone.

First we should be aloud time to use our sell phones to chat to friends at another school because who doesn't like to talk/ text there best friend! I know that i would love to talk to my friend that goes to a different school.

The other reason it would be nice to be able to use our sell phones is that it would be cool if we could use our phones and the time given to use them to do research.

we could have homework that requires us to do research on the computer but if we have a phone that has the internet, why wait till your home to get it done? I also think that allowing us to use our sell phones is like trust, you have to have trust that the students will listen to the rules given to fallow. That is what i believe the should happen about the sell phone issue in school.

I think we should be aloud to use cell phones during free periods. Technology is part of the future and we will use it when we are older. It will help us become adults. We can also keep up with our friends and our parents can call to tell us if there is a problem. Kids already use them.

But the cell phones should be shut off during class to stop distractions. We all need to face it we will all be using technology in the future. Most of our jobs will require a computer or cell phone. Why not let us express our freedom. If you tell them they cant use there cell phones they will want to use them and if you tell them they can they will think your cool and wont argue with you as much.

Another reason cell phones should be shut off during class is because the kids could text each other the answers. Let us express our freedom. If teachers can use them let us so we our all equal, and we don't look down on each other. I agree There has to be rules but we also should be aloud freedom. If we couldn't have phones at school how are we supposed to call our parents to come and pick us up. Or if school gets canceled how are we supposed to call them.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
F0B2E946A04C,"I understand that there is an issue with cell phone during school hours. But I believe this issue is never going to go away unless we work our way around it. We are now in the twentieth century, technology is a big thing, especially to us teenagers. I believe that is a great idea to allow students to bring their cell phones to school and use them during our lunch periods and other free times, as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time.

I can understand why you wouldn't want to have cell phones during school hours. Some people might say it's a distraction, having students using their phones in class or their cell phones to go off during a lecture. Or some people just don't want students to have cell phones at all. But I say we should but the cell phones to good use.

Almost everybody has a cell phone, is one of the biggest technology used everyday. But I think we can do better then just using cell phones during free time and during lunch. I believe that we should use them in class. If we use projectors, computers, and other technical devices why not cell phones? Most cell phones have calculators, let you take notes, and much more. A student always have their cell phone with them, so they could study more frequently. You can't carry a notebook around all the time like you do a cell phone. You could also record a lesson and watch it or listen to it when you don't understand, sometimes just reading and going over notes isn't enough. Less people would be getting in trouble if cell phones weren't an issue. Of course there are going to be times when a child is caught not following the rules, but everyone messes up were only human. Teenagers are always going to be tempted to break the rules. If you tell them they can't use their cell phones, they are going to be tempted to do it, and some people will.

Not allowing students to have cell phones would very much upset them. Most schools make the students put their cell phones in their locker. But most of them won't, if they put their cell phone in their locker they are most likely going to forget it and leave it at school. Which would lead to more problems. Most people are very dependent to their cell phones. So telling them that can't have it will not work. Students will always have their cells phones so why not work around it and maybe use them?

But if you can't use them during class perhaps just allowing students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times is a wonderful idea. it's nice to just have fun at school every once in awhile, especially if your cramped up in a classroom for several hours. We are young adults I believe we can handle it. I hope you take what I said into deep consideration and allow us to use our cell phones.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
D248655EAA45,"Riiiiing! Riiiiing! Like a teacher's cell phone has never gone off in class! I think that if teachers are allowed to have cell phones in school, students should be able to too. Eliminating the nuisance by having a no cell phones in school policy would just cause a bigger problem. Parents might get angry because they do not have the ability to reach their children after school since they couldn't take their cell phones to school. Also, more students would get in trouble because they brought their cellular devices to school and since its not allowed, got it confiscated. Students would get themselves landed in detention , so clearly, there's just going to be a bigger problem when kids can't bring their cell phones to school.

If students can bring their cell phones to school, but not use them in class, it's their fault if they get in trouble. Cell phones should be allowed in school to avoid a lot of controversy.

In TV shows, the teachers always hate doing detention don't they? They have to base it off of something, so wouldn't that be based off of real life? Taking cell phones away would just make more kids go to detention. Instead of only having to do it one or two times a week, it would be everyday. That would also make parents angry because maybe they told their students that they needed to take their cell phone because they had to have a way to be contacted after school. But, some mean teachers don't take excuses from parents or kids which can make people outraged.

If the principle went with Policy 2, I'm almost positive that there would be a court case about it. You can't just not listen to the parents, they are the ones that pay for the school. Shouldn't they make the decisions here? Parents would be mad because not only do they buy their kids cell phones for safety, but now that their kids would not have them, they're A students would be getting in trouble a lot more often and the teachers aren't going to listen to the parents that it's their fault. It's important for students to have cell phones at least at lunch and other free times than not at all. That way they could call their parents if they were perhaps walking to Starbucks after school with friends or their game was canceled.      ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
CB1FC8879E6C,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Cell phone usage in school is a great idea, i think that you should only allow us to use our cell phones in certain areas such as the hallways, bathrooms, lunch, and free periods. Giving us the ability to use our cell phones in school gives us the freedom that we deserve as a teenager, and it is also a good start for us to learn how to do things on our own, and learning the consequences of different things because without the usage of freedom we feel as if we don't have the ability to do anything at all, and by using our phone in class will teach us to ignore the phone and pay more attention to the teacher. And the point of a cell phone is to have the chance to be able to talk to friends and stay in touch with our family members an also if there is an emergency as well. Say if we had a lockdown in our school because there was a robber in the school and our parents didn't know what is going on they would want us to call them or at least text them to tell them that we are okay and we are safe in a room.

The usages of cell phones in classes however would not be good. because kids can use them to cheat on tests with each other, text during class and not being able to pay attention to what is being taught. Overall i think that students should only be allowed to use cell phones during free periods and not academic classes because in certain classes we are there to learn and not to fool around and use our cell phones. Certain times during the day it should be okay to use a cell phone but some parts you also have to buckle down and do what you have to do in order to succeed in life!!

When kids think of using there cell phones in school and that they have the ability to use cell phones, everybody doesn't think of what could happen to them. They could get lost or break, Damaged, or even taken away. If i had the ability to use my cell phone in school i would be so happy and excited because now i am able to do anything with it without getting caught and having it taken away from me. But then again i would also have to think about all the risks of taking my cell phone to school as well. And i also have to watch where and what time i take it out because during my main classes i would either put it on vibrate or silent because i would want to have the ability to learn something and not be on my cell phone all the time like all the other kids would be doing .

I know that you have considered two policies regarding the cell phones and the students. And I know it must be a tough decision considering the emergency's that happen in the everyday life. It will either let the students have their cell phones during school and turned off or not bringing one at all. Well I think that the best policy will be letting us bring a cell phone and turning it off during class but letting us use it during lunch hours or other free times.

Now i know you must be thinking that this is a terrible idea but if you really think about it, it all makes a lot of sense. Just imagine that all of a sudden there's a big lockdown and none of the teachers have access a phone but luckily, a student has a cell phone and is able to contact the police. Wouldn't that be a life saver?

Cell phones are very useful in a lot of scenarios.

Now i know you thinking 'What about during class? Would students secretly want to use their cell phones to text their other classmates?' Of course some students will try to do this but that is why teachers need to be very attentive to their students and what they are doing. If a student gets caught using a cell phone, the teacher takes it away and a parent has to come pick it up. If the parent doesn't come, then there will be a phone call home explaining why the cell phone was taken away from the student. I hope you do consider my request about the cell phones and why we should keep them in school I think it will be very useful in most occasions for everyone.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
4141D61871DE,"I think policy 1 should be allowed because they can us there phones but during class everyone is fine without texting or whatever there doing. If we didn't have phones at our school there would be nothing else to do at lunch or when you have free time to do what you want to do. But if they get caught with it out during class then they would have to play a fee to get it back. Also if we could use it all day no one would pay attention in class they would be on there phone all day but we should be able to use them most of the day. An plus if we did have our phones out all day people would be cheating on test an texting friends in other classes an distracting them from what there doing, but that's why we shouldn't have them out all the time just sometimes like lunch and in the hallways, but if like someone's mom calls we should be able to awnser it in case if its an emergency.

I think that policy 2 is kind of over board because now days people cant stand not being without there phones so its like our baby's to us. if we didn't have them today our technology wouldn't be like it is today, but as i was saying we should be able to have our phones because its all us kids do is play on our phones an we have nothing else to do.

Some of the students here believe that we, the school, should be able to use our cell phones in our free time. But, other students oppose, they feel they do not need to use their cell phones at all. I for one hold the belief that cell phones should only be used during break, lunch, after school, etc. People should be able to use the phones during these time and these times alone.

For example if someone had taken a fall and broken their arm, leg, etc. and nobody was around to help them, if the schools policy was that they must not have their phone during school then they would have no contact to anyone that may be able to help them. The phones are sometimes a must have. Since the phones are to be off during class time the people who feel the need of having no interruption whatsoever may have their quiet, and everyone is happy. the people who want their quiet and the people who feel the need to socialize.

Now, the teachers will also be happy too. the Students have already socialized enough at break, so they should probably be more silent. The teachers can finally teach in peace the end result is a win for everyone. No one feels their expectation for quiet or socialization unmet.

Many kids can get distracted by cell phones. The phones sometimes go off in class because a student does not turn the phone off or they forget to turn the phone off and the class gets disrupted. The cells phones will also cause students to get distracted from what they were suppose to do and then will get in trouble. The students will suffer consequences that could have been avoided if the cell phones were not allowed. Cell phones should not be allowed in school for these reasons.

Sometimes students will have their phones in their backpacks when it suddenly goes off. This disrupts the class because they will lose their attention to the teacher and look back to the student who owns the phone. It also might cause the teacher to forget what they were teaching because of the sudden disruption. The other students will get disrupted and not pay attention to the teacher and then they will not know what the teacher said. This would cause the student consequences and may get in trouble or not know some answers on a test.

Not only do cell phones disrupt class and students, but they also distract students from what they are doing. The students might be sent on an errand by a teacher and might start trying to text. The student might forget what they were suppose to do and get in trouble. If a student needed to quickly study last minute for a test and they receive texts then the student will get distracted. This might cause the student to not study and then get a bad grade or not do as well as they could have on the test.

Schools should not allow cell phones because the phones disrupt and distract kids. Students sometimes forget to turn the phone off when it goes off in class and the class will be disrupted. Other times students may need to do some quick last minute things when they get texts and then do not do what they needed to do. These reasons are why some students may get in more trouble because of their or someone else's phone. Cells should not be in school to avoid some consequences that the students might face for disrupting a class or getting distracted by their phone.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and free time because of emergency situations.

If a student forgets something like homework or other school related things they should be able to use there own phone to call and let their parents know that they forgot something and need them to bring it into school for them.

Another reason is if they are in any kind of after school activity and times or plans change or they need a ride home they can use their phone during a free period to let them know what is going on.

If they do that they do not have to waste class time worrying if their parents know and using the school phone.

Also, if there is a family emergency then the student's parents can get a hold of them faster to let them know what is going on.

This could be faster than calling the school.

This is also a good idea if a student has health issues they can let their parents know what is wrong with them and if they should be sent home by the nurse.

Plus, the nurse may not know what to do in a certain situation so they could talk to the parents on the student's cell phone.

My last reason is communication if we do not communicate with our fellow students then we don't know what is going on in other classes.

We may have a test that is hard and we can remind others to study.

That is why we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and free time.

If these reasons are not good enough you should still give the students a change.

Make it clear that they should have them off before entering a class where they should not be on.

Give punishments and rules of what they can and cannot do with the phones.

It think you should allow policy number one. It think you should allow policy one, because students get bored in recess, they use it to have a social life in school, and they can use it on their free time just in case there is an emergency. Some students like to use their phones in recess, so they will stay out of trouble and be calm. Also a phone is used to be socialized in school, to the drama, fights, and other stuff updated. The phone is used also in case of emergency's, like if you where to ripe your pants or something like that would you like to walk all the way to the office just to call home. Or just take your phone out your pocket and call home in 30 seconds? It think i would just like to call home in 30 seconds. See this is why i think you should let policy one happen. at other school's students have no problem with this policy as long as students use it for accurate things. I know you don't want to bring this policy back, because sometimes students use them during their learning time, to record fights in classrooms, and to text their friends when there like right next to each other.

D150E09CBC2E,"Policy number two

I believe that kids should not be able to use cell phones at school at all. Which would be policy two stating this. Policy two states that kids aren't allowed to have there cell phones at school at all.

The kids can use their cell phone after school but not anytime during the school hours . Policy one states that kids cant use their phones in class but can use them during lunch hours. Still i don't go with policy one because kids can easily text answers back and forth. Its as easy as the kids remembering the test or quiz questions and asking him or her about it and then going back in class and getting it right. That is no fair, that is just cheating.

Also, i believe policy number one is wrong because maybe there is some kids at school who don't have phones. Then the people with phones will make fun of the kids without phones. This is just bullying. Policy number one can lead into violence and many types of bullying. Some things or examples of things that could happen during policy one would be like a kids taking pictures and sending them all over the school and just making kids feel bad.

Policy number one is definitely wrong. I believe that policy number two is good because all the nonsense kids do on their cell phones can happen after school. It doesn't need to be around the school environment. Policy two i think will make many students mad, yes. But is it always happy times? No, school inst suppose to be for fun. It for learning or the education that matters. The cell phones being allowed is going to bring down the learning instead of helping it out and making it better.

Another way policy two is better is kid cud easily tell someone to come pick them up and take them home so they can miss out on a quiz or a test or even just school work. This is just wrong. Kids should not be able to do this.

Kids these days i see them always texting . Texting is there life it really is i walk my dogs around outside sometimes and you see kids hanging with there friends TEXTING. All the time i see kid texting It wrong, i bet those kids who were texting and having a good time have a ton of homework that not even close to being finished and instead of that they are out hanging and having fun. That's what kids like to do and is FUN.

The reason i bet that policy number one was even mentioned was probably because kids love their phone so much they want to bring them to school and have fun. Well to those kids they can go home and have fun but when they go to school its time to be serious and get the work done.

I strongly suggest that policy number two is done. Its best for everyone and the school. Kids don't need cell phones in school. Its just not good, its wrong. Kids need be responsible and grow up and learn that cell phones are not the whole world.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
E0536CFB1530,"I think the principal should go with policy 2. I guess it's okay to have them during free time or lunch periods, but eventually, it'll be their main priority. It'll probably start off okay, but when your texting someone, you tend to make the conversation longer. Let's say one of your best friends was telling you a secret about someone else. They'd text and text, and it be almost impossible to stop because you have so much you want to cover. Then they might sneak it under a table or hide it in a book as if they're reading. Well instead of listening to your teacher the whole time and not studying, you've been texting, which could affect your grades for all the time you've lost. Staying focus and putting your mind to what really matters gets you far in life, not texting.

People may use some excuses like if they're was an emergency. The school does have a phone, doesn't it? Why not use those instead. They become so obsessed with them sometimes that they become idols and we forget what's really important. If texting gets out of hand instead of working, people could fail high school, or their grades will keep them from getting into the college that they want to go to. Just save all the texting for the end of the day so that you can get done was has to get done. Procrastinating will put you in a big whole, and you'll look back and see where you messed up, maybe hoping that you had put your priorities first. By then, it'll be too late.

793800C02EE3,"Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 is very suitable for our school. There are many reasons why you should go with policy 1 instead of policy 2. I will give you three prime examples why. One reason you should go with policy 1 is, letting us do this will show our responsibility. Another reason is, it shows that you trust us. Lastly, this shows that you are willing to give us some freedom.

As i have stated previously, Policy 1 lets students show how responsible they can be. As students show responsibility it encourages maturity. Maturity is key for any student as they age. Being mature helps students think that they are getting older and can do more. This may lead to a decrease in student related school conflicts.

Showing students that you trust them is key in staff-student relationships. Trusting students also shows that you are willing to help them and get to know them. As students begin to feel trusted they grow to like their staff more. The more they like their staff the less likely they are to get into an argument with them. Students also trust someone more when they know they are being trusted.

Lastly, giving us some freedom will greatly help students with social interactions. School is supposed to be a place where students have time to grow and be free from pressure that they may have at home. Giving a student freedom (to an extent)

will show how the staff cares about them. It's key to give students a little freedom to show that you trust them. Students like me think that school is just another form of prison that its filled with more people to unfairly boss you around. Giving them freedom will show that this is a place for them to enjoy learning.

As you can see there are many reasons for you to go with policy one instead of policy 2. Whether it be to show responsibility. Or possibly to show trust. Maybe to show the students you want them to have some freedom. Policy 1 is obviously the better choice.

B528C5E19433,"To Whom it May Concern:

I was just notified that our school principal is reconsidering the cell phone policy.

Policy one is that students can use their cell phones during lunch period and during free times, policy 2 is no cell phones at all. She needs to know which policy is going to be within her best interest.

I personally think that we should go with policy 1. I think that policy one is a better choice because a lot of students like to text during class, and they like to text or use their cell phones on a regular basis. On their regular basis they basically text whenever they hear or feel their phones vibrate or ring. So while the teacher turns their back the students might be texting. I also know that if the principal chose the policy one then the students would do their work and pay attention so they can have free time and text their friends. But also if the principal just does policy 1, then the students wont have to talk or text on their phone when the teacher turns their back and they can get a lot of their work done.

I remember when i was in seventh grade, which was last year i had a teacher named TEACHER_NAME. TEACHER_NAME

didn't care what you did whether it was texting or doing homework. She didn't have any structure to where you would know that you had to get all of your work done before you could text. So that is why so many kids passed her class even though they didn't do the work because she would let you sit there and accomplish nothing. She couldn't fail you if she barely ever gave you work. So then when she actually decided to put her foot down nobody listened at first. But then she made up the rule that if you were passing and you did all of your work for that day then you could do whatever you wanted and that lit up a light bulb in my head to start doing my work.

Another thing that our school would have is better attendance. Some parents don't care whether their child goes to school or not. So some students would have to stand in the gap if their parent wont. But if a student actually wants to go to school then maybe that will influence their parents that they need to change. But if a child wants to go to school because they know that if they do then they can do whatever and more then they were going to do at home. So if the principal chose policy 1 then they would have better attendance.

So i think if our school principal decided to go with policy 1 then we would have a lot of structured kids, a better grade point average, and we would have a lot of more kids that actually want to go to school. That is why i want our principal to choice policy and why.      ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
6D50C3075ED7,"Dear principle, work, work, work, you say you want us to try our best on projects but it is had without phones. There are clubs and plenty of other things to do after school. Without a phone if a club meeting is canceled we can still get a ride home. I think it would be sensible to let us bring phones to school.

A lot of kids are in clubs, if the club meeting is canceled then how are we going to get a ride home; the solution to that is to let us bring phones to school. If we can't bring phones to school then a lot of parents wouldn't let kids join after school clubs. You say that you don't want kids on the street, so if we have a phone we can join after school clubs, and not be on the street.

So without phones we can't join after school clubs. I learned that phones can be a problem, but can also help us out a lot to. So that is why phones should be aloud. So I believe that it would be in the best interest of us to let us have phones at school.

I believe that changing the schools cell phone policy so we can have our phones out during lunch and other free periods is a very smart and wise idea. The reason why i believe so strongly in this reason is because students all ready use their phones during class, lunch, hallways, and other areas around the school. But if you instil this change of policy the chances are there would be less students texting or using there phones in class because they all ready have a time in the day to use their phones without getting in trouble. But if you do pass the policy in which we are not aloud to phones in the school building, the chances are that students will still bring them, still play with them, and will still definitely text with them in class. However if you pass the policy where we are aloud to bring them and use them in our free time then there will be a lot less students getting in trouble for texting on their phones. Phones can be distracting but they aren't going to go away and with time they are going to become more and more popular. So i feel it's better to embrace it rather then just to push it away and pretend that, that rectangle in our pocket isn't our phones because i can ensure you that it probably is.

I feel that we the students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. Some students need cell phones because their parents need to know when they get out of school. Parents pick up their children from school when they leave. Suppose that a student has to suddenly stay late for basketball practice. If the student doesn't have a cell phone, when the parent comes when they usually do, the student won't be there to be picked up. Thus, resulting in the student not having a ride home.

Students should be able to use their phones during free time. Now with all the social network sites like Facebook and Twitter, students want to be able to be updated on what's going on. Also students like to surf the web and go on Youtube and do other enjoyable things. The students would get a chance to text or email other friends that may not be at the same school. I feel that it will give the students, like myself , a sense of independence being able to use phones.

Now I know why you may want students to not use phones. Students can cheat on tests by looking online or texting. Also you don't want students to text during class and other times when they shouldn't. That's why after lunch and free times you should do a cell phone check to see if the students turn off their phones. If you were to find at least 50 phones on, then you can take cell phone days away for a week. To me that sounds like a fair exchange.

All in all I hope you decide to go with policy 1. It is a better and more fair choice for the student body. Please take this letter in consideration. Thank you.

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME

I'm writing you this letter to let you know that I and other students believe that policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, should be the new rule or at least try it for a week or two and see how well it works. If it doesn't work that well then don't make it a permanent rule, but if it does go well then you should make it a permanent rule.

I think that being able to use your phone during lunch periods or other free time would be great, because it is so boring for students when all they could do when they are done with everything is sit there. We already have problems with students texting in class, I'm sure if you made policy 1 a rule we would have an outrageous amount of problems lowered.

I have asked quite a few students around school which policy they think would work best, a huge amount of students picked policy one. They also said that they would use this privilege wisely and not hinder it. I agree with these students. Now its all on you.

I am a student at you school and I have had some concerns on the phone policy. I have some ideas and suggestions on things that can be added or changed to the policy.

I think that all students should be able to carry their phones, but only in lunch, study halls, ands in hall ways. I think that if any student is caught with their phones in class they should get their phones taken away for the rest of the day. The students should get their phones back at the end of the day. Another thing is if they are caught three time the student should get a detention. I think that if you enforce those rules there will be less texting in class, less cheating, and it may raise grades because of the increase attention in class.

There are many reasons why the students need their phones. some of the students have their parents working and can not communicate with anyone in case of emergency , others have after school activity, others also have to call their parents to pick them up.

Many people will suggest to have the students go to the office to call their parents. That will only lead to packed offices. There may also be emergency that restrict people of getting out of the office.

There are lots of reasons why you may want the students not to have their phones but my opinion is that the reasons why they should have their phones out way the other reasons. In my opinion and all of my research that I personally did i think that the best choice would to let all of the children have there phones.

""Ring, Ring, Ring""

The teachers looks at the student. The student goes and takes her phone out of her bag and starts texting in her class. i believe the students should not be allowed to use their phones in free time. If they use their phones they will disturb their class mates, they will not focus on their work and they will not pass to the other grade.

To begin with, i believe that students should not have phones on campus because they will disturb everybody that wants to learn. What if the phone ringed in the middle of your class and the girl or boy goes and picks up the phone. When he or she douse that the student will start talking really loud and giggling. It will cause the other students to not concentrate and fail their test. The sad thing about it is that the teacher cant do everything because he or she has done the test and has nothing to do.

Together with disturbing the class there is also that the student will not focus on their work. They will be to busy texting on their phones that they will not get to focus on the school work. They will not do their home work and will not pass the FCAT at the end of the school year. The teacher will give them work to do but they will not learn how to do it because they did not pay attention. They will have bad grades in all their classes and even drop out of the school they are in.

Last but not least the student will not be able to pass to the other grade level. With no work done and with little learning they will not pass the big test the FCAT.

""Hey STUDENT_NAME I'm texting STUDENT_NAME. Anyway what are we learning about?"" Many students would text during class and not pay attention to their teachers or in class. I believe that most students will not be able to control themselves with this much freedom. I believe that students shouldn't be allowed to bring cell phones to school.

Many kids in school with text in class and not pay attention. So man kids would be want to text in class and they will. Then when the teachers asks them to answer a question they wouldn't know the answer since they weren't paying attention. These kids were too busy texting their friend across the room or where every their friend is. Another reason is that some kids never payed attention that they start failing their classes for not passing their tests or for not participating in class. Their grades will start going down and it affects them dearly such as going to summer school or even repeating the grade. Not only that but these kids would distract other kids from their education. For instance, one kid may text to another kid, and that kid might start texting back to who ever text him. Next thing you know, is that those two kids just lost one day of their education and is now having trouble with that subject the rest of the year. Cell phones in school is a distraction for kids.

I truly believe that students wouldn't have any control what so ever if they have cell phones in school. They would get distractive and distract other kids from their education.

I think it would be a bad idea if the school district and your self would allow everyone to bring there cell phones to school , even if there turned off during class. I don't think its okay because its during lunch time and free periods, students should be socializing at that time. I also don't think that it will teach students to be more responsible for there stuff.

I do not agree because some students are mean and curl. They just don't care! They will take other people stuff, and sometimes if they don't like that person they will brake there things just to seem cool. When they are not!

When all that happens the first thing they will do is run to the administration or to the principals. Then parents will get involved.

I think policy 2 is the best one because students shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones at school it take your whole focus off of school. When you are in class in your phone is on and one of your friends text you , you are going to stop what you are doing just to look at that text message you are taking your mind off of the lesson in class. Phones can also be a detraction to others, if you forgot to put your phone on vibrate and the ringer go off in class the teacher would have to stop the class and take up your phone and the students will be looking at you. Phones can get you in a lot of trouble like taking a serious test and if you get caught with it you can fail or be retained in that same grade, phones should be banned or taking up for the school hours. Most students be to concern about their phone that they'll fail , and phones can also start a lot of trouble you can start a rumor at school about someone just by sending a text message to one of your friends.

54EBADB0DE35,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you're reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. This maybe my opinion but I think many other children agree. I think you should accept policy number one. Cell phones are a very important part of the new world that we live in today. Cell phones should be allowed because they can be used to call for emergencies, parents feel more secure if they can contact their children anytime, and because not everyone has friends that are particularly in the school that they're in.

To start off, cell phones are one of the most important things to have if you're in an emergency. It's very uncommon to be in an emergency at school ,but I would prefer to have my cell phone just incase. We can have bus accidents, be in a fight , leave your house keys at home, need new clothes if you uhh... have an accident. There are all sorts of reasons! Expect the unexpected is what they might say. Emergencies are a very common reason; I know. The reason why it's usually repeated is because it's important! As principal, you must always think of the children's safety.

Continuing, parents feel a lot more secure if they can talk to their children anytime. If you have a daughter or son, you should know the feeling. Parents always ask their children to bring their cell phones with them when they're out with friends, at a relative's house, or even at home! They want to know that you're safe everywhere you go. It's a parent thing, I suppose. Also, cell phones have a contact book that saves everyone's phone number that's registered. You can't believe how many people I know that don't even know their parent's or house number! I read in a book that there has been an accident in South America that made parents uproar about cell phones in school. Now that wouldn't be pleasant, now would it?

Finally, not everyone has friends that they can see in school. They can even be in different periods than them. As a teenager, we always worry about our social life as well as academics. I have often heard from kids that they love going to school just for their friends. Some people aren't part of the 'in crowd'. The people who are, however , can talk all they want if it's during free time. I don't see any harm in that.

In this letter I'm going to explain which of the policies i believe is better. The policy that I think is better for the cell phones is the first because we could use the phone to ask question like in my case I forget thing and i could ask one of my friend to help me with the homework and if there a problem i could call the police and during class is good idea to turn them off because at some point phones are going to distract students from learning the subject or to study for a test and if you don't have a computer you could use your phone like for an example my phone I have the iphone 4g I don't have computer but i could go on the internet and search what my question is a video to show me how to do my projects. Maybe you left your lunch home grab your phone call your parents if they can they could bring your lunch.

the first policy i believe is better because many students like phone and want to call to have a little freedom to call someone a friend and i now that they could get distracted in calling everyone but that could be good way of communication to help out, to be in touch with your study group. maybe they had an accident in the school and no one has your parents number and your the only one.

I think that if you kids use there phones in school the will more then likely cheat on a quiz or a test. I have herd of kids from different schools who have been able to bring there phones to class. Of course they over used it and cheated on homework and the where getting on the internet and looking up bad things and more kids were becoming bad. The teachers were just done dealing with all the kids who were cheating on test and texting in class. I also think that if we could bring our phones to class that it would be good for some kids because then we could text our parents and tell them we need lunch money, homework, backpacks, and anything we left at home. Today i know kids in our school that text and call people during school hours, i' m not going to say any names but kids do it all the time and personally, knowing all the kids i know, they will completely over abuse this if we allow it at SCHOOL_NAME.

I am still going to go with Policy 1 because I use my cell phone in the hall or at my locker sometimes. My cell phone is always in my pocket turned off i call my mom or dad to ask if they can bring me up my lunch money or homework. If you let kids bring there phones to school, and they promise to use them in a needing time. I have fear that some one will break in to the school and/or the school will catch on fire so I always keep my phone in my pocket and i have the police on my quick dial on my phone. I would hate for someone to break in and no one is able to call 911 so i think they should allow kids to bring there phones to school.

But what makes me really mad is when teachers say ""Ok kids put your phones away and spit out your gum and no drinks in class."" and they are sitting in the front of the room texting and drink diet soda and chomping on some bubble gum. That is just one thing that grinds my gears. they are so hypocritical sometimes.

7E365E9933BA,"I have two different opinions on cell phones during school. To preface them, I want to begin with saying that cell phone usage, as a whole, is of little importance. Teachers seem to be reluctant to enforce the current policies we have, as cell phones do not distract most students, especially if set to vibrate and not ring. And most students have enough control to not use them during a time of importance, like when taking a test. And no student will ever give up their usage of cell phones during class, so long there is a way to use them during class, even if it's against rules.

Both policies have their merit, but I believe Policy 1 would provoke less outrage from students. Not all students have free time at the same time as others. For example, when I'm in my lunch period, which is period 5, somebody else may be in their math class. This matters because I can possibly interrupt his thought during an assignment. Also, students will not turn their phones off unless punishment is severe, and teachers are actively looking out for students using cell phones. Policy 2 would also be fine, with the exception that students will probably be annoyed with the principal, or the Board of Education, or whoever promotes and declares this new policy. To work, Policy 2 would also have to be enforced well. However, students would likely resent Policy 2 more. It's restricting, especially when it pops into place so suddenly. Sudden, harsh change isn't favored by anybody. Even parents may be involved with making Policy 2 controversial within the town, as some feel the need to keep in touch with their child during school, especially after certain security issues happening at them, such as pipe bombs, smoke bombs, and guns being brought and used at some schools throughout the country.

Policy 1 is the better policy, but in the greater picture, a problem posed by something so miniscule as a cell phone doesn't matter. Thus, I'm indifferent to anything regarding cell phones. I do admit to using mine sometimes during class, but I have enough self control to not turn it into a problem. However, if one is to go about changing the policy on cell phones, it'd have to be enforced well to work. This is where the boundaries of teaching and babysitting students blend. If cell phones are that much of a problem to the staff, then teachers likely aren't teaching because they're being told by their superiors to make cell phones a priority. When a teacher is actively looking for people that are using their cell phones during class, chewing gum, not wearing a school ID, etc., they ultimately aren't doing their job, and that is what truly matters.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent

Ring Ring Ring....! ""Who's cell phone is that ringing in the middle of my math class"" yells TEACHER_NAME! Cell phones in school have many pros & cons. With the policy of cell phones in school can lead too so much trouble such as: students not learning, students constantly off task & are not focused, or maybe even fights or violence. Cell phones in school can also be a good thing also known as a pro. With cell phones allowed in school as long as they are turned off during class time isn't bad, but with the students able too have them they are more than certain to take advantage & use them during class time anyway.

Cell phones in school are a huge distraction. Students would be so into their texts messages or their cell phone calls in the middle of an important lesson instead of listening & taking down notes for their next test. If cell phones are allowed in school, it would be a waist of useful learning time & knowledge being given away. If you are learning how too read, write, or use arithmetic then maybe you could use that knowledge too teach someone else. I believe that it is more important for all eyes & ears too be listening too the teacher, actively participating in class, & working hard to achieve something big then too be texting or on the phone in class or school time period. Most people think that you have too text in class & it is necessary. Well not really because cell phone use in class can lead too lack of knowledge, disrespect too students & teachers, & you being off task and unfocused.

""Oh my your phone is trash, that cheap twenty dollar phone? PLEASEEE! Mines is a 100% better."" Students may argue & bicker about their phones being better than someone else's phone. I can guarantee that if phones were left home & not on school grounds or property then that would decrease the problem of trying to be better then the next person. Cell phones in school can cause many fights & cause terrible violence. But to stop or avoid that cell phones in school should be banned & a legislative state law.

Dear Principal,

I am thinking about the policies for using cell phones at school. Since many students are using phones, they will of course want to use it at school. I surely know that all of the students would want Policy One, since it enables them to use their cell phones at break time. That will mean there will be a less amount of phones being taken away during class, because they spent the time using their phones at break. Of course, the students cannot use their phones during class. I would agree with Policy One.

Using cell phones at break would decrease the amount of students using cell phones in class, since they used their break time to use it. That will lead to a decreasing number phones being taken away, and also a decreasing number of referrals and detention.

Letting the students using their cell phone during break and lunch time will lower the chance of fights. It also could make the voice level go down, which will be a relief to the yard duties and other teachers.

I know Policy One will work for the students and staff, because if you don't let the students use their phone, they will try any single way, and use any spare time during classes. That would end up in disaster. All of the students in this school will enjoy the time you will enable them to use their phones, and the school will be a happier place.

Since the school's cell phone policy is being reconsidered, i believe students shouldn't be allowed to have phones out while at school.

Many teenagers would disagree with my opinion, but I have many good reasons.

Students wouldn't get as much exercise.

After lunch they would be more focused on texting than interacting with there student body that is face to face with them.

Since we have the privilege of getting to go outside after lunch and talk or play football, basketball etc. many students would be more worried about their phones than getting rid of all there energy that has built up all morning while sitting in a classroom.

I think a lot of students would also take advantage of the privilege by using them during class while a teacher wasn't looking.

Many students do it anyway and phones have to be turned off.

Also i think this would lead to a lot more drama and children getting into trouble.

Someone could text their friend and say something mean about another person but that person would find out they had been talked about at school so the problem would have to be handled at school and not at home.

There would be more verbal abuse that could lead to physical fighting.

From my point of view students would be more interested in checking their phones than going to class or remembering to go by their locker and grab their homework for their next class.

This would lower many grades and may cause students to fail a class or even a grade.

Many students might make it a habit to be tardy or skip class because of this new policy as well.

The school's cell phone policy should not be changed because along with this change their would be many problems that would also occur.

Students can use their cell phones on their own time out of school.

Please consider my reasoning before the policy is finally changed.

I don't really have a opinion to it because in both cases there is a good thing about it and a problem to it.

For example what happens if a kid parent had a problem at work and he cant pick him up when school is over how is the dad going to tell his son that he has a problem and that he is not going to pick him up. or maybe that the boy had to stay after school for a program or serve detention how is he going to tell his father that he is going to stay and the father is going to get mad at him because he didn't inform him about what was going to happen after school.

On the other hand having it is going to be a distraction as i said before because many other kids are not going to pay attention. They are going to be on the phone while the teacher was giving the lesson for that day. Not all the kids do that they may find a excuse so that they could message while they where out of class and the teacher thinking that he/she went to the restroom or to pick up something from another class.

As u see there is going to be a problem picking witch one is ok for the school and many are going to agree or disagree. i couldn't pick one as u see but i gave u two reasons why it is good and why it's bad for us students. i know it is going to be a tough desition but your going to be ok with it.

I believe that students should be able to bring their cell phones to school because of many different reasons. Such as if their parent needs to tell them something and the school line is busy, what would they do then. What if a Child Molester were to steal a kid off the playground they would have their phone to call for help, or text for help.

Now, I know these things are a little far fetched but would you risk a student like that. One of the students relatives could have died or is in the hospital and the student needs to go to a friends house after school because the parents are at the hospital that is in another town. Texting the student would be much easier that calling the school and keeping the kid from class for 10-20 minutes wouldn't it.

Now, this whole Child Molester thing most likely will not happen but i mean just in case right. It would be better if the student had there phone on them just in case something happened. Another case would be students running off to were a teacher could not see them. Jr. High, High School, Elementary it doesn't matter kids are rebellious by nature. These kids that ran off, one of them gets hurts no time to run to a teacher and run all the way back. So, what do you do you pull out your cell phone and call the school or a friend that you know will answer. Then a teacher comes and helps you and you get in trouble for not being where you were supposed to be doing. But everybody is ok, why because you let them bring their phone to school.

These things most likely will not happen but you have to think outside the box because anything can happen in this crazy mixed up world.

I am writing this letter to you about the new school policies on cell phones. Each policy has their pros and cons, and I want to give you my opinion on which will benefit the teachers and we the students. I hope you take this letter into consideration.

I will first talk about Policy 1. Policy 1 benefits the students greatly, we would be able to call and text our friends when we couldn't be together. Some phones even have internet, so we could surf the web on our own free time. Other types of phones have fun games too.

Some of the problems of this policy are some students might lose or someone may steal it. That student may blame the school, which would put some pressure on you to change the policy on cell phones. Students could also not turn their phone off and bring it to class. They would text their friends and not pay attention to important topics in class. People that have internet on their phone could look up answers and cheat. I think this policy is good, but could have some problems in the future.

Now on to Policy 2. Policy 2 is good for teachers and is ok for students. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids bringing their cell phones to class. Students wouldn't get distracted by their phones at times when they don't need them. They wouldn't have to worry about losing them or someone stealing their phone, and have to waste money on a new one. The cons of this policy is that some students still may sneak their phones and use the features of their phone when the teacher is looking. Some students need to call their parents after school, and without a phone, they don't know where there ride home is. This policy is also good, but no matter which policy, there could be a problem.

Out of the two policies, I think Policy 1 is the best. I need my phone everyday so i can call my parents to pick me up after my sports activities. Good students will be thankful that you chose this policy and obey the rules, turning off their cell phones during class time. If a student does break the rules and bring a phone to class, you should confiscate it for a certain period of time. If a student's phone gets stolen or he/she loses it, its their own fault and the school can't be blamed for it. This is my opinion, and i hopes it's yours too, if this policy fails the school, then by all means, try Policy 2.

Sincerely, Your Student",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think that Policy 1 is the best choice for our school. it seems like there is a lot of time throughout the day that there is free time. and instead of sitting around in your class doing nothing. why not be on your phone? also at lunch it seems very acceptable to be able to use your phone. lunch is your personal time to eat and socialize with your friends. it should also be aloud that you should use your phone.

Now, kids still use there phones they just have to try to hide it from there teacher. and the teacher has to spend class time taking phones and giving lectures to the person that was caught with the phone. I think that if policy 1 was chosen the amount of kids using there phones in class would greatly decrease. Because if kids knew that they could get on there phones during times like passing period and lunch. then they would not have a reason to have to be on there phones during class time, and in turn, kids would focus better in class.

It wouldn't be taking up class time, if kids could use there phones during there free time. there would be no harm in allowing students to use there cell phones during time that is already meant to be the students personal time. In a workplace, cellphones are not banned. and since school is basically a students workplace. then the same rules and freedoms should apply. Even most teachers check there phones throughout class. i think that if the teacher can have time to take away from teaching there students, because they need to get on there phones. the student should be able to use there phones during time that would not affect anyone else, because it is there personal time.

Most students use there phones to communicate with there parents during school. if there something the parent needs to tell there kid. for example, that they need to ride the bus because the parent wont be able to pick them up. a cell phone would help a lot in a situation like that.

I don't think there is any reason that kids should not be able to use there cellphones during free time. i think that if its free time it should be the kids choice what they want to do with it.

there are also a lot of days throughout the school year. that they are purely fun days. well during those days where we are watching movies just to kill time. i don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to use our phones. rather then watch a animated movie because the teacher had nothing planned.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
A585AF7C6630,"Dear Principle,

I have heard you are dealing with some issues concerning cell phone policies. I personally have seen how much time teenagers spend on their cell phones. I, being an intelligent young teenager, do not have a phone and do not want one until I drive for safety issues. When my friends and I are talking they are always on their phones texting and I am left there to do nothing but stare at the wall which makes me mad but also forms my opinion. My opinion on the matter is that teenagers can bring their phones to school and immediately turn them off during school hours. I would not allow them to use their phones during lunch periods or free time. You might think I'm being cruel but think, if kids use them during free periods they can get on the internet and look up answers and anything else the internet has to offer, which is not always good stuff. Now once free period or lunch is over most kids will forget to turn them off and you will have ring tones going off which not only interrupts the class but also the students.

Also, teenagers tend to get jealous over which phone other teens have. They say I don't have just a phone, I have The Evo 4G which will lead to disagreement over phones. What will happen when some people have phones and then they make fun of the people who don't, allowing phones will just add to bullying in your school. I also think that the young adults will steal each other's phones because of how nice they are, leading to argument and hate. The students will probably even look to you to see what has happened to your phone and what could you do about it, nothing. I think phones at school during hours is a bad idea because they are on their phones 24/7, so allowing them to use them during school just adds to that amount of media they have in their lives. With phones getting advancing so quickly, I think you should ban phones during school hours. This is my opinion on the matter. Thank you for your time.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

Everyone needs cell phones right? Many students at various schools have their cell phones with them all the time. Many students even try to text during class, even if it means getting poor academic grades. The two new policies that you have proposed, seem to bring a solution. Even though, with all due respect, one policy seems to not be a good idea. I think that policy number 2 is an excellent idea.

I think that policy number 2 is the better choice because it allows students to be more concentrated in their homework, their school work, and their personal school achievements. If a cell phone is allowed to be used during free-time or during lunch, the students may get distracted on what they are supposed to be learning from their teachers during class. If cell phones are to be not allowed in school, the students have a very good chance of not getting distracted while they are in class. This will allow them to be concentrated on their studies, than rather their social life, while in class.

I think that policy number 1 is a very bad idea because students may take this chance to text and take pictures during class while using their cell phones. This may cause a very big distraction towards their learning environment and academic grades as well as their concentration towards the material being taught to them by their teachers. Teachers may also take as a very bad situation because the students in their class would not learn any of the required academic material.

This would also implicate the students getting poor academic grades. The students who would be using their cell phones while in class would get grades such as C, D, or even F. Students may not be able to culminate or graduate because of these scores and grades. These grades would also implicate the results of their CST scores as being very low. This would bring the school's reputation as well as the CST scores to a less appropriate stance towards the LAUSD records.

These are my reasons for choosing policy 1. I think that these reasons are well enough qualified to change your mind about policy 2. I hope you take my opinion into consideration.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

TEACHER_NAME, I think you should consider policy one for lots of different reasons.

Students should be allowed to use their phones during lunch periods and free times. Sometimes we have to call home and being able to have our phones out is a privilege that would help us and if we have our phone out in class that privilege can be taken. Sometimes I has those days where I leave something at home and it would be nice if i have times during the day when I can home. You have some kids that may not follow the class part and that's where where you got to be stricter in the classroom but it would help with teaching responsibility. Not to have our phones at all is just torture we sometimes have to let our parents know things and we cant do that's my opinion with this matter as long as it doesn't begin to interfere with education we should at least be able to have them after school.

Thank you TEACHER_NAME

F814EB30A6F5,"Dear principal,

Many people in our school probably think that cell phones use should always be aloud. For me it's different , I think that cell phone use should only be aloud when students have a free period or a lunch period. This should be aloud because students may need to use there's cell phones for important things like , if there is a intruder in the school students might want to call there parents and let them know.

Students should not be able to use cell phones during school because they can be distracting & disturbing.

Cell phones are very addictive. Students may use there cell phones all day when they are at home. School is a place for learning not using your cell phones. Teachers get very annoyed when students phones go off. During school hours I think cell phones use should be limited at the time you can use them . For example, lets say we are sitting in English class & a students phone goes off. To you , the students who are also trying to do there work and the teacher it can get very annoying & very disruptive.

Students should be aloud to use there cell phones during free

& lunch periods because they aren't disrupting anyone when there cell phone goes off. Many students text their parents during school & other kids in their lunch period. Students may need to text their parents during class but they just have to wait until they get a free period .

In conclusion, in my mind students should be able to use their cell phones during free periods or lunch. Other students may think they should be able to use there cell phones during all school hours. Why do other people think that ? People can get hurt by the people who are texting in the halls & not paying attention. That is why i think students should not b e able to use cell phones during class time",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
2CD20ADA226B,"Policy one

I agree with policy one, policy one stated "" Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class."" If i was a principal i would the students have a cellular device because I would want my child to have a cell phone to contact me .

Many parents would have there sent to school with a cell phone not just because to show friends but to contact them incase of an emergency or if they need something at a particular time. A cell phone can be used for entertainment for business or for personal reasons. Cell phones are meant to be used for communication but not to be used in class. School is more important than an cellular device school will help you achieve your personal goal so you can afford you own cell phone.

Spending time on your cell phone at lunch or outside will be find with me because your not in class disturbing nobody your with your friends and having fun. I would allow my students to explore on there cell phones when any free time is giving . The rules would be the same in the class no cell phones out when teaching in class. when students caught with the cell phone I will keep it until schools out then they come pick the phone up after school.

Another reason why children should have cell phones is Parents, teacher, principals and other staff members all have cell phones . sometime you might see your teacher her phone but when the student is on there cell phone they have to get there cell phone taken up which is not fair. The rules should inflict on the teachers as well as the students in the class room. If the teacher gives the students free time then there able to be on the phones.

A student having a cell phone out in class will cause consequences but when giving free time they will have the opportunity to be the cell phone. Cell phones are use for personal reasons and for contacting parents. This letter agrees with policy one un the passage .",3,Cell phones at school,Independent
102076E99FE4,"Dear Principal,

I understand that cell phones can be a distraction during school and that you are trying to decide on a policy. I think that it would be a good idea to allow students to use their cell phones during lunch and free times. We should allow students to use their cell phones because it would give them time to text their friends so that they wouldn't have to do it during class and become a distraction, they would be less tempted to use it during class if they knew that could have it out right as class was over, and need their cell phones to call people in case of an emergency.

If students had time to use their cell phones during free times, they wouldn't have to have to sneak in text while walking through the halls, and it gives them time to get one last phone call in, or one last text in so that they wouldn't need to text during class. And turning your phone off when you get in class really isn't that hard at all. Students like to socialize with cell phones so I think it is good for them to be able to socialize a bit more.

They would be a lot less tempted to use it during class if they had the opportunity to use it during lunch or while walking through the halls. It wouldn't be such an essential to text your really good friend during class because you could just use it before or after you get to class. This could also help with tarties, students wouldn't have to go all the way to the other side to the school to find their friend and be late to class, they could just text them or call them telling them what they wanted to tell them on their way to class making tarties less of an issue.

Emergencies can happen at any time of the day and students need to have their cell phones to call someone to come get them or call the police. Cell phones can be very helpful in any emergency. If a fire happens they can just call their parents to come pick them up rather than waiting for a long time for the school to call all the kid's parents that don't have cell phones. Also if you have a cell phone and your friend doesn't they can just use yours instead of waiting like all the other students, and it can help out the school by creating less people to have to use the schools phone and it will be less of a hassle for the school.

Cell phones can be a great use for everyone and teenagers like to have their cell phones with them. Having a cell phone and being able to use it during lunch and free time would make students not need it as much during class time. It would make students not be tarty as often. In emergencies a cell phone can be very useful. Giving students the opportunity to have cell phones during free time and lunch would also teach the students responsibility and it would make them much happier.",5,Cell phones at school,Independent
4E4FAB530872,"I agree with policy 1 because student should get to bring their cell phones to school. Some reasons why students should be allowed to bring them to school are, students might need to have them for family emergencies, students might need them for contacting there parents to transport them home from after school activities, students can use the calculator on there phones for math, students can take pictures with there friends, students might need to use the internet, and students can text other students to see what's up. All of these reasons can help students have a better and much easier life personally and educationally. If students weren't allowed to bring them at all there lives would be so much harder. Students could also listen to music with there cell phones. Music helps relieve stress and calm peoples nerves. It also helps people relax. The only thing bad is students could bring them to class and secretly text or some other thing and it could possibly bring there grades down. But teachers get to bring there cell phones to school and use them anytime they want so why shouldn't students? Students should have the same rights as teachers or any adults. The constitution says that all people are created equal. That should give students the right to bring cell phones to school.

C2636186175F,"Policy One

I believe that students are responsible of having phones in school, but remembering to use them at the appropriate time. I feel students should actually get a chance to take on that challenge instead of letting them choose for us. We as students know that it is a reason that we shouldn't have, but teachers need to recognize to that we do need them in school for certain purposes. For example, I ride the bus home at least three times a week. Sometimes I need to call my mother to ask her questions about the transportation problem. I do realize that we do have school phone that I can use for that situation, however the system is not quick enough when you can just get it done right there.

My problem about this rule is why doesn't the rule involve everyone such as teacher, superintendents, and advisors. Why do they text and talk to people on their phone, taking personal calls when they shouldn't be allowed that. They don't have consequences for that action, but students like me do. We get it taken away and if they see it again, possibility that you wont get it until the end of that school year. Us as students know that we can get consequences for cell phones, we also know how to prevent from letting the cell phone actually for being seen. I'm not saying if they allow students to use cell phones on school hours at specific times they would use them in the right ways they need to be used. Basically we need a chance of proving ourselves wrong or could we actually be right. Policy One clearly states to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time and I think students are mature enough to handle this policy very well.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
E63B119399A4,"Dear Principal,

I think the better policy of those two offered is the first policy. For one reason, students already text during class, so if you give them the opportunity to do it in between class periods and during free times, there will be no need for them to text during class.

Another reason to let us have cell phones during free times is that if we need to fix our plans, we could call our parents and tell them what we are going to do. An example of this would be that if your after school activities were cancelled, you could call your parents and arrange for a ride.

A third reason that I like this policy is that if I wanted to go to a friends house, I could just get out my phone in between classes and call my parents and ask them if it was alright if I went. I wouldn't have to go to the office in between classes and I would already have the number programmed into my phone.

If you are afraid of students texting during class even with this policy, then you should design and give them a contract to sign. What I mean by this is that you should make and print out one contract per student. It wouldn't have to be a very fancy or official contract, just make it state that if they do text in class, they lose their privileges. It should also say that if they get caught doing it again, then they would start earning themselves detention.

If you choose the first policy, many students would be happy with your choice. I also suggest that you use some of my ideas to help.

I feel that the first cell phone policy is the superior choice. While cell phones are a distraction in the class room, not giving students the right to use them in off-periods and time not in class would encourage student to use them in class, which is distracting, the issue we are trying to avoid in the first place.

While a strict ""no phone in school"" policy does seem like the right choice at first, lets consider the cons of this policy.

1. It is practically impossible to watch every student in the classroom for discrete texting, but other students may still be distracted by it.

2. If students get no time to use their cell phones, they will still want to use them at school, and therefore use them at inconvenient times, such as during class.

3. It would take precious time out of class to correct a student every time that student is caught with his or her phone out. This would not only be distracting to other students, but take away time that teacher could be helping another student.

Now lets look at the pros of the first policy, shall we?

1. Students will be able to connect with there friends via mobile device during appropriate times, therefore reducing the urge to use them during class or other inappropriate times.

2. Students will feel as if they are being given more freedom a school, therefore raising morale among students.

3. I feel the main reason that phones are banned in class is because they represent a significant and obvious distraction and disrupted learning environment; but during lunch and off periods, there is no learning environment to disturb.

4. Not being able to connect with their friends would also urge students to talk during class more, creating an even more obvious distraction for students.

As you can see, there is only good things to be said about the second policy. And while a strict ""no phone in school"" would seen to be the more obvious choice, as one looks closer, it truly isn't.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter, I hope you make the right choice, and abolish the ""no phone in school"" policy. Only good things with come of allowing students to use their phones in school.",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think students should be able to bring there cell phones to school and use them on free times cause suppose it is a emergency from your parents and they want to get in contact with you at least they know you have a cell phone the reason i agree with policy one is because in case of an emergency , you just want to listen to music on your free time or you just want to have your phone with you.

In case of an emergency you will have a phone to contact your parent or guardian or your parent or guardian can contact you suppose the school was on fire you would want to let your parents no about it so you can just call them on your cell phone or any other minor injuries you can just aware them about it.

On free time most students will want to listen to music if there bored and some teachers may not understand but music helps a lot of teenagers now a days to concentrate and it can also help you focus but its not that bad you can listen to your music on free time.

Music is one of the things most of teenagers like to listen to so i think we should have cell phones allowed at our school

Most teenagers just like to have there phone with them at all times so they can show everyone or just for them to have like if you want to know the time and the television is off in the classroom you can just look on your phone and if your parents are trying to text you something like saying don't ride the bus today it can be very helpful to have your phone .

A lot of teenagers love having there cell phones so i think policy 1 is really good because of emergencies or any sort of injures or anything you can have your phone with you at all times to call up your parents or who ever you call you so i hope everyone else would agree on policy 1            ",3,Cell phones at school,Independent

Nowadays most kids carry around cell phones for emergencies or just to be able to connect with each other. I strongly believe kids should be able to bring their phones to school incase of family emergencies or because of a medical problem. Even though many kids use them to mostly socialize they can be very useful in a life or death situation. For example, If a student was having a medical problem during lunch and they couldn't reach the clinic in time they could take out their cell phone and ask their parents to pick them up immediately. I strongly recommend policy as opposed to not being able to have immediate help.

Another reason kids should be able to have cell phones on campus is that they can call for help when they are seriously injured and there's no one around to help them. Like say that someone had fallen down a flight of stairs and had shattered their arm and there's no one around to hear them call for help, they could whip out their phone and dial for help. As for not having them on in class, I completely agree because they shouldn't be on at all time on campus.

All In all I think students should be able to carry around a phone incase of impending danger and or a medical problem. I hope you agree with my statement and have good judgement.

FBC7DC3C27C0,"To Whom It May Concern:

I am writing this letter regarding your policy on cell phones during school hours. In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students. As school goes on, the curriculum becomes more difficult which encourages students to study harder and focus more on getting higher grades. While their grades are very important, this may create stress on some students which may even lead them to get lower grades.

Permitting the use of students' cell phones during school could possibly reduce the stress they have from being the studious children that they are. Having less stress and pressure on them may result in higher marks and eventually an exemplary school. This could benefit the school district greatly and this policy can be spread to other schools so that all of our campuses can be exemplary.

Another reason why this cell phone policy could result in a positive outcome for our school is it could maybe even save lives. For example, if there is a fatal emergency in the cafeteria that involves choking, a student could simply dial 911 to get an ambulance there as soon as possible.

There may be some issues when first putting the policy in order, but once students get used to the idea that they are allowed to use their phones during free time only, they won't bother with sneaking any texts during class. To prevent cell phone usage during class, students should be allowed to go to their lockers after lunch to put them away while under the supervision of an administrator. This keeps them from cheating on tests, contacting anyone outside school, and being distracted in class.

I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. I am hoping for your kind consideration.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

Additionally people maybe well give out answers to a big test. by this i mean the answers might be wrong and people are copying what the person text them. the teacher might of change each test for each period. People are going to get mad at the person who give the answers to them. for example my sister friend text her the math quiz answers and she got caught and fail the test she told me "" never let someone bring you down with them its a big deal.""

People would make drama over something little. to help my answer what i mean is people would get there phones stolen. People would say someone did it and get them suspended and it may not be them.

they probably would fight over a phone that looks better then there. there's this one time my friend RELATIVE_NAME that got into a big problem over a phone she said "" i would never use my phone in school property again"".

Furthermore people who text other people from other schools might get there phone taken always. all schools don't have the same rules. they would get mad at the person for making a mistake like that. People just don't get the point that they need to pay attention to class and worry about school. school is only 9 hours and that's it you could have the rest of the time to text. i used to get in trouble a lot and get my phone taken always. till this one day my mom said ""you have all day to text get your grades up.""

Dear Whom It May Concern,

Not allowing kids to have phones out at school it the best option.

Not having the phones would mean that they could focus more in class and not be distracted so much.

Kids would be involved with more drama if phones were allowed at school.

Inappropriate text messages and pictures could be sent while at the school, via cell phone, and most parents would not like their children to be involved with this.

One reason phones should not be allowed at school is distractions.

Kids already get distracted very easily and don't pay attention in class.

With the phones, they wouldn't pay attention any more than they already did.

They would be too busy texting or on the phone with someone than to be studying for a test, or finishing homework.

Another reason phones should not be allowed is more drama would be started.

Rumors start drama, and no one likes drama.

Rumors are mainly started by texting, and with phones kids would have the opportunity to text and spread rumors more than they do without them.

Drama can cause conflicts between teachers and students, students and parents, parents and teachers, and students and students.

The last reason phones should not be allowed is they are not necessary.

Now kids aren't allowed to have phones and some choose to not obey the rules.

If caught, they are punished for not obeying the school rules.

Kids can fully function without their phone in their hands the whole time.

Obviously since phones aren't allowed now and children can talk to each other and carry on their social lives, there is no point in having them at school.

No phones at school is the best decision there is.

Although some kids may need music to study or work to their fullest extent, they can do that home.

Phones can cause so many problems between people, and no one wants to bring that into the school. The policy on no phones allowed at school should stay the way it is.

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I agree on policy two, that there should be no cell phones allowed in school.

I think that if we would choose policy one, students wouldn't obey the policy. Even though Students would enjoy using their cell phones at lunch and other free-times, they would most likely sneak their phones and text during a lesson in class. Also, if the school allowed cell phones, students might forget to turn their phone off, and it would ring. The ringing cell phone would be a distraction to other students, disabling learning. I don't think students need to be using their cell phones at lunch and other free time because most of their friends that they would text or call would be in the same room.

If we chose policy two, there wouldn't be any distractions because there wouldn't be any cell phones at all.

What is more important? Having students not be able to use their cell phones during free time, or students not being able to learn because of cell phone distractions? Students not being able to learn is more important, and that is why I choose policy two, to have no cell phones in school at all.

D5F7178E3FB1,"To the principal at SCHOOL_NAME I would go with policy one because its better for us instead of turning it off when we come to school and cut it back on at 3:50. I say this because we can use it during lunch peroids and other free times like when you doing a project or when you need to use it for a stop watch or whatever the case maybe. Also it my be a emergency's i say this because probably your mother sick or your father or grandparents in the hospital and they had a heart attack. And they need to get in touch with you and your phone off during school so how you gone know what's going on with them would i advice my principal to go with policy one for a reason it my be a emergency's or your family going through things and its very important and you don't want to talk about you don't cause i know i be through things like this so i would want my principal to pick policy one cause you might be in them shoes like that so that's all i would say.

I think that you should not allow phones to be used at all in school.

If you allow phones to be used at certain times in school students will soon get to comfortable with the idea and want to use them all the time. If you allow students to use phones in lunch there could be sexing or cyber bulling going on in your school.

Many phones will be lost and stolen if this is allowed.

This idea of have phones allowed to be used at certain times in the day is not a good idea at all and should never be put through.

Policy two is the way to go.

If phones are allowed in lunch and free periods kids will get comfortable with the idea of having phones on them at all times.

If students have their phones out for lunch they may keep them on and with them for the rest of the day. You get so used to having that little square in your pocket you might forget to take it out and put it in your locker after lunch.

This can lead to phones going off during class and distraction from class because students are texting under the tables.

Phones are useful and can be good but they can also be used for bad.

In school if this is allowed the number of cyber bulling and sexing will go up trumendouly.

There are all sorts of problems and fights that go on in school but if you give them a loaded gun they will only use it for bad.

There would be many more detention and guidance visits from the students if this is allowed.

This will make your staff stress out and angry.

Children these days are clumsy and forgetful. If you let them take there phones out of their pockets every minute to answer a text they will most likely lose it somewhere.

If someone have that brand new cool phone there will be people who will steal it.

That will cause fights and just many more problems.

This will lead to more fights and a lost and found full of phones.

This idea is just not good for anyone.

It will cause distractions and poor grades.

It will cause more sexing, cyber bulling, and will lead to stressed out angry staff members.

This proposition will also lead to a full lost and found and fights.

Policy two needs to be brought to action and policy one should never be passes.

Do not allow phones to be used at school at all!

E392A61F0E02,"I think Policy number 1 is better because you need to have your phone in case of emergency. Another example is that you should turn it off in classes but on your free time you can have it on.

You need to bring your phone to school in case of emergency. Because what if your parent or someone your close to got hurt and your mom or dad is trying to reach you in school and you don't have your phone with you. Another reason is say if your stuck in school and you need your parent to pick you up from school, and if you don't have your phone and your parents are looking for you. They might think you got lost or kidnapped or you just ran away from home.

You should bring your phone to school but you should have it turned off in class.

Because if you take a test it should be off and if you have it on and your teacher finds it on they can say you are cheating on a test. Another example is when it is free time you can have it out because it is free time you should be able to do what you want on your free time.

65286FBCAD2D,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should not be allowed to use our cell phones during lunch and free period.

I think this because of cheating, bullying, and disturbance in class.

Because cell phones are an easy way to communicate students will take it for granted on tests, essays or homework.

Students will be able to give an answer or even the questions on the test with ha click of a button.

This is not fair to other students who studied hard or did their homework when they were suppose to.

teachers will notice a dramatic change in grades from period one to period seven.

Even though students would only be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free period, answers still travel quick. Because of cell phone use answers to tests, essays or homework will be spread to the whole school.

Isn't school suppose to be a friendly and safe environment? I know that with cell phones the bullies have more sneaky ways and techniques to bully a peer. When sending a text message it is received by the person instantly.

Therefore more horrific comments will be spread all over during lunch and free period.

With cell phones these nasty comments will not be caught.

Chances are no will no but the two bullies texting and receiving the messages.

When bullies know that they are not going to get caught they will keep bullying.

Then the bullying trend will come an even more popular style.

You might think that all students are going to listen and turn off their cell phones during class but they wont.

They will take advantage!

During class students come to learn and expand their knowledge.

With the disturbance of constant ringing and vibrating their learning experience will be interrupted.

I know that teachers want to have a learning environment but when they hear a cell phone they will lecture on about how that is not acceptable.

That too will take away from the students learning time. Cell phones are suppose to be helpful but not disruptive.

Students might love the idea having usage of cell phones allowed, but it would not be a good choice.

Cell phone usage during lunch and free period will have students chatting on tests, essays, and homework.

cell phones also will increase bullying and will be a huge distraction during school.

School is a safe environment and cell phones will interfere with your students learning experience.

1D6257F878C4,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have been informed that you are thinking about adjusting the school polices for cell phones. Well, I must confess, I do not have a cell phone, so I may not be the best person to ask in this issue. However, I feel you should be a bit less lenient with cell phone use in school, and here's why.

First up, the most obvious reason: they are a distraction. How can any student concentrate on school if they hear a constant buzzing noise, or if they hear their obnoxious ring tone going off every few minutes? You may wonder why this would be a problem in the classroom if students are only aloud to use them in the hallways or in between classes, but for convenience purposes, to save a trip the locker every time we would want to use it, we'd keep it in our pockets. If we ""accidentally"" leave them on, they'd disrupt the class. Plus, if one class is working while another class is changing classes, I'd bet RELATIVE_NAME talking loudly to his girlfriend in California is a bit more interesting than Bohr models, so that would naturally throw the class off a bit.

Second of all, cell phones can really cause stress. My elder brother has a cell phone, and I can tell without even asking him that he just received a text that had bad news. In the class room, that can cause a bit of trouble. For sake of example, let's say RELATIVE_NAME just got a break-up text. Yep, she sure is going to focus on the Battle of Trenton in history for sure next class!

Lastly, let's say RELATIVE_NAME's family is really struggling money-wise right now. They can't afford the cheapest pay phone in the book right now, so naturally, he can't have one. Meanwhile, RELATIVE_NAME has the latest and greatest Droid on the planet, and she's always showing it off. ...What's this? Did she leave her locker open just a little? RELATIVE_NAME is really tempted (really, really tempted) to just reach in there and...

Which brings me to my final reason: if cell phones are constantly receiving attention in school, therefore, encouraging crime. After all, I know a big, shiny Droid is pretty hard to pass up, no matter what the means of getting it.

So, for these reasons, I believe cell phones should be banned from school.

I feel like we should be able to bring them because they are a little part of our life it builds our social life and connects us with friends. Also what if were walking home and its after school and we get hurt how are we going to get help without our cell-phones. But i agree we should be able to bring our cell-phones and be able to use it during our free time because were not bothering no one or harming them.

To whom it may concern,

I believe that cellular devices or cell phones should be not allowed during free periods and lunch.

I Believe this because sometimes you need to contact family members, For example when there is an emergency going on with your family; someone is hospitalized, somebody has passed away , but that is not always the case.

I also see them as a distraction if being used for different reasons but, when these rules are made some people would like to be allowed to have them on campus, but the choices the district make are for our benefit in learning and succeeding in the real world.

In reality you cannot sit in your office and text the whole time you are there, so why start the bad habits now?

These devices are not bad but i believe it is not helping you to have them with either.

I understand some of the reasons other people would like to have the privilege to carry a cell phone but the way i see it most people do not follow the rules and take it out hiding it, and secretly texting or calling people.

Do not get me wrong i love having my cell phone but not being in contact with your family and friends for six hours will not kill anybody.

I know there will be many students now and to come that will disagree, but if you want to do well in school texting in class will not help you keep an ""A"" in any class.

Even having the temptation could be a distraction to your self and will not keep you focused.

Texting not only distracts you from the teacher some of the others around you can be distracted by it also.

So in conclusion I hope you see that this will not only benefit us but our grades because kids will have no choice but to pay attention.

E2AF0F6F8B0C,"Dear Principal,

I'm writing this letter to inform you that Cell phone at lunch should be okay and all of the free times that we have. While school is going on. Texting in class will keep the children's and teen's from learning on what the teachers are trying to teach them. And if i was the teacher i would have done made the rule of teacher letting the students text friend's during school as in lunch, or free times between classes. when there in the hall's. For the thought that if your in class then your not lurning much of anything but putting text messages in your head. On the other side of why it's not a good ideal of student's having phones in school is because most people are nothing but drama. As in they will start conflicts and always' need to go and see you.

Most students that have cell phones all they are doing on them is starting drama because when one person gets a text message then theirs going to be another student getting the drama shown on there phone so for and so on. Cell phone's travel as in the text message one person and can tell you something very sad and you don't want anyone else knowing but your friend. Then if you and your friend get into a fight then there's going to be Drama with in you and your old friend you all will get into a big fight. All texting in ways is drama because people are childish in all kinds of ways harassment, bulling.

Then theirs way's that I can see why teacher and you don't want the students to have there cell phones out any place at school is because of the internet students get on facebook, or anything that can get people starting in with drama. The facebook can lead to harassment, and bulling just as the text messages can. In lots of way's I do see where the teachers are getting at that cell phones are not safe for the school regulation. Because students can and will get hurt if the drama on cell phones is stated then the kids and teen's parents might contact the school and yell and most teachers around don't want that happening.

That's why cell phone should not be in classes but during lunch and free space of time yes they should be allowed.

You should allow students to bring their cell phones to school.

One reason is, they can call their parents.

Also, they can keep then off when they are in classes.

Last, the students can have them out during free time, and when they are at lunch.

Students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school so they can contact their parents.

First, if they stay after school, they can let their parents know they need picked up.

They could stay after for a sport and they needed their cell phones to let their parents know they needed picked up when they were done with practice.

Next, they could ask their parents to bring their gym clothes or something else they forgot.

If they forgot a project or some homework at home they can let their parents know they forgot it and see if they can bring it to school for them.

Second, the students could keep their phones off during the classes.

If they keep their phones off then they won't be bothering them while they are in classes.

If they have them on in a class and it goes off it could disrupt some ones concentration if they are taking a test.

Also, they won't have their phones on in the middle of class so that they won't be tempted to take it out of their pocket and text or call someone.

Last, If they keep them off in classes the kids won't have out their phones texting each other answers to a test if they are taking one.

Last, the students could have their phones on during free time and lunch time.

If they needed to borrow some ones notes because they needed to get caught up on them they can ask the person to meet them by a place so they can borrow the notes.

Next, they can keep their phones on during free time to let someone know that they are done using the notes, or to help them on something that they are stuck on.

Finally, they could let someone borrow their phone because they don't have on or just forgot it at their house.

In conclusion, you should let the students have their cell phones in school.

They could keep them off in the class but then have them out during free time.

Also, they could call their parents to remind them to pick them up or to bring them something.

That is why students should be allowed to have their phones at school.      ",4,Cell phones at school,Independent
C8E30EE22644,"The best policy, in my opinion, would be the first policy, or policy one.

That is the best policy to choose because the students will bring their cell phones to school anyways even if you choose policy two.

The students will not be using them as often if the first policy is chosen, because most people at our school work differently.

They are told they can bring cell phones, they won't bring them.

When they are told they can't bring cell phones, they will bring cell phones and won't care if it is taken up in class because they are texting when phones aren't allowed at all.

They will try to text in the bathroom and call their parents or their friends when they are in the bathroom, but this could be avoided if the bathrooms had speakers in them where the office could hear everything that is going on, so they could also hear about fights and then they would be able to break it up and know exactly who started it.

The students would be able to use their phones during their lunch period and during other breaks, and they would be happy with that.

They would be texting their parents during the lunch period to tell them if they feel sick or texting their friends, asking them what they are doing after school.

This would especially help the kids in high school, who go out partying with their friends after school, so they can ask their friends what they are doing after school and if they want to go party at the usual place they can go partying at.

When they can use their cell phones during their lunch period, they will ask their girlfriend or just their regular friends what they are doing after school and if they wanted to go for a walk, go eat in various places, or if they wanted to go see a movie.

If they said that they did want to go somewhere, they can decide through texting rather than going to sit across the room just to ask them one thing and deciding where to go, which could take the whole time.

If the policy is changed, there would need to be a couple of changes made, such as speakers in the bathrooms, so the office could hear what was going on, whether it is someone texting their parents, calling their parents, calling their friends, or texting their friends, which would possibly get them in trouble if their cell phone was on vibrate or they had their volume set anywhere from one through seven, which the usual volume is seven on anyone's phone, even if they are in school and know that they can get in trouble.

This can happen anytime during the day except at lunch period, which is everyone's favorite time to use a cell phone.

There are also exceptions to when they can bring their cell phone to school.

For example, they shouldn't be allowed to bring their cell phone to school during MCT testing time.

There are ways to make sure that they don't have one during this test.

You can make a phone call that goes out to every student in the classroom, and if a phone rings you can take it up and give it back to them after the test is over.

Then the student will know that they are not allowed to bring their cell phone to school during MCT testing time.

There are also ways to make sure that a student doesn't have their cell phone on during class time.

You can make periodic calls that go out to every student in the building, and if their cell phone rings they can be informed that they must turn it off.

The periodic checks can be made every 30 minutes.

When a student's cell phone rings more than once, then their phone must be taken up, and they should get a referral from the office for in-school detention, or, possibly however many times it rang, out-of-school detention.

When this happens, they must be informed that only their parent can pick up the cell phone, and only during a certain time of the day.",4,Cell phones at school,Independent

I think that students should not have their phones at school at all because not all students will listen to the rules.

One reason I choose policy 2 is because some kids would use them during class and then they would get in trouble.

They would be used to cheat on tests, text friends, and get on the internet.

Many kids would use them to look up answers for papers, tests, homework, or any other projects.

Some might even use them to get on chat rooms or any other website, like facebook and myspace.

Some students would then forget to turn them off, if they were allowed to have them on during free times.

Then they would become a interruption to the educational process.

Teachers would have to stop class and have to tell the student to turn it off or even some teachers would take the phones.

Many kids would have to pick up the phones at the end of the day so they didn't get in trouble again.

More kids would get their phones out after they finish something in class, like homework or a project even if they weren't allowed.

Many students would get in trouble with their phones then without them.

Some students could even use the cameras on their phones to take mean pictures or inappropriate pictures.

There would be more bullying going on with classmates and friends.

Mean stuff could be sent around the school about other kids.

Some kids would even send out rumors causing someone to get hurt.

There would be more causes of kids getting bullied if students were allowed their phones.

Many students would use them so much during lunch that they would get into their conversations with others that they would not eat their lunch.

That would have more students wasting their lunches.

Sometimes there would even be a ton of leftovers that the cooks made and then you would eat the leftovers the next day for lunch.

Students having their phones could cause some major damage to friendships and grades.

That is best for us students. we need cell phones to help us not forget numbers. instead of caring a sheet of paper. you can just get your phone out and go to the contacts.

we should be able to use them when in gym,lunch,and outside. And that teachers keep there phones out and can text call or anything like that we need the same thing.

i understand that some students will get careless and just text and class. that is when it need to be taken up. because you are in class to learn not to text. but we don't learn nothing in lunch or outside. but we learn in health but not in gym playing basketball all the time.

all you do in our gym class is do your exercise and then play basketball or football.

i know it help you learn these sport but that just a class to text or call in. you should not text or talk in a library. because a library is a place of quiet and noise from your cell phone is not tolerated. why you are walking it is not good because you bump into people who might get mad at you. you should not be able to text during crct because you may run out of time and fail the test.

because without the crct you will have to retake and then if you fail you are retained.

Plus teenagers love to talk to people so when there friend is in another room they can text them what happened in there class.

Not having phones at all in school wouldn't be to good. Some people might have something important to tell there parents.

64A4EBA4CC37,"Some schools allow students to complete classes online or through video conferencing from home as an alternative to being on campus. Students would not benefit from attending classes at home because this leaves optimal room for cheating, this could cause students to lack social skills, and this is an open opportunity for procrastination.

Having access to a computer or a cell phone is an advantage in the new technology-based generation. However, this leaves a place for dishonesty in work when used for in-home learning. Using the internet, you can access absolutely any information with a few clicks or taps. Websites such as 'Brainly' and 'Quizlet' are used by students seeking answers; they type in a question from their work and every answer for all of the questions is right there in their hand. With cheating instead of actually learning and retaining knowledge, students will fall behind in the real world. In a classroom, most likely you will find that cell phone use is prohibited due to the fact that students don't use their phones for learning purposes. When students are guided by teachers instead of given the answers by computer, they are more likely to remember the information later in life.

Students who work from home are not around their fellow classmates. Being isolated from people is one way children and teens can lack social skills that they will most likely need now or as an adult. In a classroom, you are surrounded by other people your age, and you all can learn from each other. Classrooms are one of the first places where you learn how to communicate and collaborate with others. These are only a few of the social skills you could lack from being alone every single day. These skills are needed for getting jobs when you are older and for many other opportunities in life.

Working from home is a plus for getting to sleep in every day and being allowed to work at your own pace, but some students could take advantage of this and procrastinate. As i stated before, in this technology-based generation, a cell phone is a good thing to have. However, that could also serve as a distraction. Instead of being in the classroom where students are required by their teacher to complete tasks daily, they are in the comfort of their own home free to do what they want to do. Watching television, talking on the phone, skipping work days, and oversleeping can all lead to falling behind in work and receiving failing grades. When you have a teacher pushing you to complete each task when it is assigned, you are more than likely to complete all tasks given to you on time. This way, you will keep up your grades while also learning a sense of responsibility.

In conclusion, students would benefit more from learning in a classroom than they would from working at home. They won't be able to cheat on their work as easily as they could from home, they will have good communication skills from being surrounded by their fellow classmates, and they are less likely to procrastinate their assignments.",4,Distance learning,Independent
C5EFBFA0F25E,"Over 25% of students struggle to focus and learn in public schools. Most public schools can be beneficial in some ways that can help students. There is another option if you don't want to attend a school you can take online courses which help keep people that are not able to go to school. Most students go to a public school and do not take the online classes because they were raised that way. The reasons why online classes are beneficial because students can get one on one help with many different teachers and they can fix the classes to their schedule.

One reason online courses are beneficial is because students can get one on one help for a variety of courses if needed. Some students struggle and they don't know what to do first or they don't remember how to do it. Most students have trouble remembering how to start but if they do online courses they can video call a teacher for help or advice. Sometimes students need a recap of the lessons that they did on previous courses. On online classes they teachers that are on their for almost the whole day and students can contact them whenever needed. The students can ask for help at almost any time they want and teachers will be prepared and waiting to provide one on one help with students. Most students can't contact a teacher when they need help and are in normal classes that's why online courses are more beneficial to the students.

Secondly, students can adjust classes to their schedule depending on the amount of time they have. Sometimes students have trouble trying to schedule their activities and sometimes school gets in the way of those activities. Students that have that trouble can schedule their courses depending on what time they have available. Online classes dont take very long to complete and can be easily fit into a busy schedule. Students can do the classes on any device which allows them to do it anywhere at any time. Students can do online classes at any time frame that they are available at. Their classes start and finish time revolve around the time frame that they set themselves.

On the other hand parents still think that it is healthy to let their children go to schools that have those bad environments. Most of the parents say that it helps them be more social and keeps them from staying in the house too often. The solution to this long going problem ,of taking physical classes with crowded class rooms and many distractions, is to let their children take online courses. Many of the students that take online courses have had problem with public schools like crowded rooms or big class sizes. Students have trouble focusing in classes that have larger number in it. The students mind has difficulty focusing because of all of the ca-motion that is in the room.

In conclusion online courses benefit the students a lot more than the average classroom does.

Many students that take online classes have higher scores than normal students because online classes provide more help. Most students that are in normal classes struggle because they don't have one on one help. The many students that have online courses are more happy and have more free time than normal students. Students prefer online classes because it revolves around their schedule and they can get one on one help with work.",5,Distance learning,Independent
CA4E39042770,"I agree with that, because some student's would not come to the school, this a huge opportunity for us, we have some reasons to take classes in online because we missing to much classes for us graduation, and it's easy organize our own time. It's important to study because all of us, want to be a professional.

In some cases the student's prefer to come at the school, but I believe that for mejority of us, is preferable to take classes in online, because we don't have troubles with anyone and we can do the classes in anytime.

For example; Many of students had job, and they have to work sometimes in the night also in the day, but they make an effort to complete their study. I am working really hard in my classes, and manytimes is very stressful. I want to take the advanced diploma, but I miss one class, so here I have the opportunity to take in online. In my opinion these is really important for us because is a help to continue a life less stressful. Something that I like is to pass time with my family and share with they, but I don't have time because I have to come at the school and I get to many tasks, exchange if we take classes in online we can do many things.

In addition; is good to come at the school but for the senior students is more preferable to take classes in online beause we begin to work in restaurants or another places. I want to have this experience of not coming at the school and take my classes in online and I want to learn new things to develop my abilities. It's a good idea to know that we have more options to take classes when we take classes from home we have the advantage to sleep more. Students would benefit in this way because we want to do different things and not come to the school almost all day. For example: I want to travel but i can't because I have to come at the school.",3,Distance learning,Independent
632998A6072F,"What would make the students feel about attending classes from home, instead of school? Students attending to class everyday early in the morning can be stressful. Especially if students don't normally attend; their attendance can effect their grades. They will not learn from anything by the distractions that are going around in public schools. It is best for students to stay focused and concentrated to be successful. Otherwise they will not learn the education they need.

Homeschooled can be the best option for students. The reason why, is because there isn't a schedule to follow. The main important reason about home school is that the students will stay concentrated and should complete all assignments in a less distracting environment. Students will not have to stress over load of work because there will be plenty of time to be able to complete them. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers.

Students complains about having to do homework for one night and not having enough time to complete them. Homeschooling will allow students to work on their own pace. Students sit on a desk for 6-7 hours everyday. They have limited of time for eating and using the bathroom. It will make the students feel pressured about the rules. Such as how to properly dress for example. Homeschool doesn't have any rules to worry about other than students getting their studies.

Public schools can be very difficult to handle as a student. There are bullying, physical fights, accidents may occur, and also on lock down that isn't a drill can be very dangerous. Students should go to school just for the education and have to not worry about any problems. Students should feel safe at a public school. Homeschool should be the safest environment without any worries or problems.

Homeschool is for the benefit of students to pass all of their exams and to also have good grades. Students are staying on task on every assignment that counts. Students should feel comfortable without any rules involved. Public schools and home school are similar, but home school is nothing but getting your education. Home school should be the best option for students.",4,Distance learning,Independent
38B237B2F190,"In the current era, you never have to step foot in a public school ever again. Yes, you are still lawfully required to complete the majority of your secondary education, but the ever growing access to laptops and other electronic devices has introduced a new method for students to earn their highschool diplomas. Some school districts now permit their students to learn and participate in class via internet or video conference. While this innovation may seem like a peek into the future of American schools, it is not without its share of faults. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in typically absent-causing.

After every school year, students are expected to show mastery of the cirriculums in each of their core classes. What the final exams fail to measure, however, are the other critical life skills that students obtain in the classroom. For example, group projects do more for the individual than teach them a bunch of facts and figures. They also simulate the level of collaboration students will use regularly as future members of the workforce. Similarly, assigning nightly homework goes deeper than the teacher's desire to keep their pupils busy, as learning to balance piles of graded assignments is an effective way to teach lessons about time management. Taking online classes will enact these same skills to an extent, though the lack of classmates combined with a more flexible schedule puts students in a bit of a bubble. In other words, school becomes less about practical application and focuses significantly more on pure academic knowledge. While online classes accomplish the same goal in their cirriculums, they fall terribly short in teaching students other important life skills.

social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to ""quiet down"" and ""focus on their assignments"", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers. Online classes, with their isolated environment, cause students to lack the same interaction and attention they recieve at school everyday.

Of course, schools would not offer their students online classes if it came with zero benefits. There is a strong arguement to be made in favor of virtual schooling when students are abesent for an extended period of time. When faced with extreme situations, like severe illness or family emergencies, students must also stress over catching up on their work upon returning to school. Online classes would allow these students to complete assignments and learn course material outside of the classroom. Nonetheless, this peace of mind is only applicable if the student is mentally and/or physically capable to do schoolwork while enduring such a taxing hardship. Online classes may come in handy when students would usually miss school, even the pros are of this school system are laced with cons.

The debate of online classes in place of traditional schooling is a complicated one. Allowing students to complete their academic career without actually attending school may help keep them on track, as they could continue to learn in situations that would otherwise require an absence, but at what price? Online classes cause students to miss out on important life lessons and practical skills, such as collaboration and time management, due the the structure of the assignments. Additionally, students will have less opportunites to interact with their peers and create long-lasting memories at school-sponsered events. For now, it is in the best interest of the children and the future society to keep students in the classroom. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in absent-causing situations. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
BA930ABE4928,"Online school has become more and more popular in the past years, which is possible today due to the evolving technology. Teachers upload the material and video chat with the students to teach, and the students submit their finished work for the teacher to grade. This seems like a great way for students to learn at their own speed and to attend school even though you might not have a way to get to school.

Every student has their own learning speed and way that they learn best. I usually understand things pretty fast and do not have a lot of trouble learning at a fast pace, many other students need more time to understand a topic and more explanation. When in a class room there is only a limited amount of time to ask questions or for the teacher to explain again. Every student also has their preferred way of learning. Some keep most information when they write it down over and over again, some are more visual and need graphs or pictures, and others have to try ore build things to learn. This amount of individuality is often not possible if you are in a class room with twenty-five other students.

When I was in eight grade we learned about Australia in English class, and how the kids who live in he middle of the outback use online school and video chatting to do their school work. Australia is not the only place where that would be handy; students here in the US live very rural sometimes too and take a very long time to get to school. If they could do their school work online they would not have to go through the trouble and could to their work from home. This would also come in handy if you have a severe illness or injury and it is impossible for you to attend school for an extended amount of time. The student could do their homework from home or a hospital and not miss months of classes and possibly have to redo the entire year.

However this is not a fit for everyone. Some need more help and assistance that can not be provided through a screen but has to be done in person. I like having the opportunity to talk to my classmates about the topic or ask questions directly to the teacher. I find it easier to understand, especially difficult topics, when they are explained to me face-to-face.

Online school may not be something for everybody and I believe that everyone should decide for themselves personally if this would be something for them. I prefer going to school and learning in a class room because I get easily distracted and would not actually learn anything if I was at home. Today, it is almost impossible to not use any kind of media and technology in your day to day life and it makes learning a lot easier. We have to find a middle point between not using at all and too much.",5,Distance learning,Independent
E39559BF14F2,"My step sister, Generic_Name, use to do online classes from our home because she suffers from a physical illness that doesn't allow her body to produce enough blood cells. Because my step sisters body does't produce enough blood cells this effects her body to get tired very quickly. Generic_Name can't stand up for long amounts of time and can't preform as much physical activity as others. When Generic_Name preforms too much physical activity, that her body cant obtain, she will get very light-headed and feel as if she's going unconscious. If Generic_Name puts her body at too much physical risk, she could possibly have a seizure. Online classes were very beneficial for my step sister, Generic_Name, because it allowed her to be at rest when learning. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is a very beneficial to those who suffer any kind of mental or physical illness and to those who have a busy schedule. Although, others believe the youth is too irresponsible to hold themselves accountable for such a tremendous responsibility, and is not beneficial for students.

The opportunity for students to attend online classes or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who suffer any sort of mental or physical illness. Both mental and physical illnesses come with a unique everyday battle, for the individuals who suffer from them. Some students suffer from mental illness's like: PTSD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. When a student suffers from a mental illness and attends a public school it can be extremely difficult to cope. Depression is a mental illness that affects someones thoughts and feelings to occur as more negative. In some cases, depression can affect someone physically. Someone who suffers from depression and attends a public school can face daily difficulties, like, getting out of bed in the morning for school and participating in class. When I was in the eighth grade, I had to transfer out of my public school, Generic_School. I transferred out of Generic_School and instead received my eighth grade education through online classes. I took online classes from home. Attending Generic_School was a difficult responsibility for me at the time because I was in a very depressive state of mind. When taking online classes and being home schooled, I had plenty of extra time to slowly pull myself out of the depressive mindset that I was suffering from. I pulled myself out of this depressive mindset, by using my extra time going to therapy and receiving medication to improve the negative thoughts and feelings that I had towards myself and life. Online classes benefited me because I learned all of the eighth grade circular that I needed to at a pace that was comfortable for me and my mental health at the time.

Students who take classes online or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who have a busier schedule. Some children have busier and more complicated lives compared to others. For example, some children are raised in households that their parent guardian struggles financially. When a child is raised into a financially struggling household, he or she will busy themselves by working a full-time job. A child who is raised into a household like this will work full-time because they will do anything it takes for them to be financially stable on their own in their future. A child who works a full-time job, typically doesn't have enough time out of his or hers day to attend a public school. But, he or she will have the opportunity of having extra time to prepare themselves for their future. In a hypothetical situation like this, online classes and video conferencing from home would be very beneficial to students who are born into households were they have no choice but to busy themselves and to be an independent because they can't be dependent on their parent guardian.

Although, others believe that distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing is not beneficial. Others believe that distance learning wouldn't be beneficial for students because the youth is too irresponsible of holding themselves accountable for having such a tremendous responsibility. My freshmen year, I had a very close friend, Generic_Name, Generic_Name was a trouble maker at school. Because Generic_Name was a trouble maker at school, her parents thought that public school was not the best place for her to receive an education. Therefore, Generic_Name took online classes at home. Online classes tend to be a very tedious and a independent responsibility that requires a ton of focus and self-control. Generic_Name did not have these qualities. Because Generic_Name took online classes from home and obtained the qualities of having no focus and no self control, she did not take her online classes as seriously as she needed to. During the times that Generic_Name was supposed to be focused with her online circular, she was more focused on boys and going out to parties. Distance learning was not beneficial to Generic_Name because she was too irresponsible to have such a tremendous responsibility that she was supposed to hold her accountable for.

In conclusion, depending on who and how someones personal life is, distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. This can be tremendously beneficial to those who suffer from any kind of mental or physical illness and those who have a busy schedule.",5,Distance learning,Independent
6BDFC792D2D4,"Research shows that students work better at home compared to going to school five days out of the week. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home rather than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one time with their teacher.

To start off, attending classes at home will relive students of stress. Many students go to school with bullies and many unkind people, the aftermath of this it that many students suffer from stress and anxiety. Stress and anxiety are not good for human beings physically, mentally, and emotionally. Therefore we should take it very seriously especially for the students trying there hardest to receive a good education. For instance there are multiple bullies in school that enjoy picking with others, this causes students to be fearful of going to class. Being bullied is a big burden to bare. This will cause many students to not willingly attend school in fear of being bullied. Also school can be very hard and challenging. While your at home their is a higher possibility of being more relaxed and calm, rather than at school it can be very hectic and judging. Home is somewhere and you can relax in a quiet peaceful area while you are doing your schoolwork. Taking classes at home will allow students to stay away from all the hate and negativity.

Furthermore, attending classes at home will allow students to be able to focus and concentrate more efficiently. Many students complain of their classmates being goofy or disruptive, students in the hall making noises and being to loud, and even fights and arguments within the class rooms are a major interruption. If students had classes at home it would be so much easier for them to focus in a calm and quiet area. For an example, Many teachers say that multiple people in there classes find it hard to focus due to class clowns, students acting out, hallway disruptions, and being distracted by doing things that were not instructed by the teachers. Also many students found it very challenging to focus on what they needed to when all they heard was ruckus. A result of not being able to pay attention, many students tend to fail or not make the grades needed to pass the class or even the grade. Many parents would consider having their children attend their classes at home so there children can be successful. In order of passing your will have to be able to pay attention which is very hard in a class full of students.

Lastly, it allows students to have more one on one time with there teachers. In a class full of students, it can be very hard trying to assist every students with all there wants and needs. Also there are many students that are confused on what they are learning because the lack of help and attention they are receiving. For example, a students once said at one point she was clueless on what she was doing. This was because the teacher was never able to get with her and work through the problems due to the teacher trying to satisfy everyone else needs. This is a problem because every now and then students need individual help and it is hard to receive that help when others need it as well. This can all be resolved by letting students attend classes at home. This will allow students to receive the one on one help they need with their teacher. The teacher will be able to walk through with the student step by step and teach them the way needed.

In conclusion, Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home rather than at school because It relives them from large amounts of stress, its allows them to to focus and learn more efficiently, and it gives them plenty of one on one time with their teacher. Attending classes at home will benifit studnets in many ways.                   ",5,Distance learning,Independent
59A5BE420CB6,"Many schools have already adapted to Google classroom and online education helpers to help students keep up to date with their work. It is important for students to be able to keep up with classes if they are absent from school. Especially for high school students, missing one day of class could put a student far behind on classwork and new material. Distance learning should be taken seriously for students who do not have the option of attending school. With distance learning, it would be beneficial for students who are sick, help maintain grades, and help teachers have students understand the material without having to pull the student aside.

Catching the flu or common cold is normal for students in school. They can not help catching it. Staying at home and not being able to attend school is not something many high school students would want, knowing they have their GPA to worry about. There are also students who are terminally ill and have to be at the hospital for weeks to months. Students who are in the hospital, sometimes have to repeat a grade due to missing too much classwork and not being able to keep up with their classes. Having the option of distance learning would benefit students like this at home or somewhere else. They would be able to understand the work and new material if they can video conference and access classwork online. It would also benefit the school, having students still learn even if they are at home.

High school students have to worry about their GPA in order to get into college. One day of missing class could push a student far behind his or her classmates. Many schools across the United States have been using Google class for students to keep up their work and to remember to do homework. More and more schools are assigning laptops to students, so they can all connect with teachers and classmates about projects, homework, or questions. It is considered distance learning if a student could connect to it outside of school. Besides Google classroom, online lessons could help absent students maintain their grades. It is a shame for students to not be able to understand the things they missed due to health reasons or family emergencies. If more students can maintain their grades through distance learning, that would benefit the school as well when it comes to education ranking. If more students have higher grades due to keeping up with missed classwork when they are absent, it would help the school gain a better status as well.

Video conferencing a class or teacher while absent would benefit both teacher and student. Normally, students would have to stay after school or before in order to learn the material they missed. This takes time away from the teacher and student. It is a teacher's job to help every individual student if they ask for it. But both student and teacher could have conflicting schedules or have after school activities to attend to like sports. If a student could video conference a class from home, he or she could be able to learn with the class instead of falling behind and asking their peers to help them. For teachers, that could help the teacher have all of his or her students understand the material together, instead of having to take time away from his or her day to re-teach a lesson.

Overall, distance learning could excelled further on in the future. More students and teachers could sync together when it comes to learning missed classwork and lessons. Education is a must in the United States. And using distance learning even more could help more students nationwide, and benefit their academics. The future could be bright if distance learning could be incorporated into the education system more than it has been.",5,Distance learning,Independent
4C9D310A1516,"As a person who loves to stay home, I can say they would not benefit off of this method of learning, some students may, but most would not. If students were taught at home they'd be able to goof around because they have free will and no teacher to tell them what to do, they'd be less focused because they have more distractions because they're at home with all the things they like. When taking a test it would just make cheating easier as the teacher may not be able to see the student. On the plus side there would be less arguing because if you get upset with the teacher you just mute them and turn off the camera, but then again that's another reason not to do this.

I think the only reason to do this would be if the student was sick, out of the country, or injured severely. How much sleep would the studen get when they are out of the country, because of the different time zone? Good part is they may get a better education doing this than in their own country, it prvoides students new opportunitys to learn more about themselves and the world, yet it's a terrible idea what happens when the connection is bad and the stundet doesn't know what's going on, then they're lost on evrything.

A2CD2CBF5A87,"Students would not benefit from taking online classes from home. In a classroom setting it is easier to focus on the work a person is trying to get done, someone is there to tell you to get your work done, and it is a social skill aid. Some examples of this are that I find it hard to focus on my own, in the book

Throne of Glass the main character Celena is moved from a situation she is familiar with and is distracted by all of the new things, and I have become less shy because of the friends I have made.

It is easier to focus on the work given to a person. In the book

Throne of Glass the main character Celena Sardothien was in a place called Endovier, early on in the book she was removed from that place and moved to a castle. On the way she became very distracted by the things around her and not her task at hand. She needed constant reminders of where she was going and what she needed to do. Once she was reminded she would remember for a day and then the next she would forget. In order for students not to be in the same predicament they need to be in a classroom setting where thy can focus on the work at hand because everyone is working on the same thing.

Someone is there to keep a person on track. In my life I find it hard to focus on a task at hand if I am uninterested in it and tend to procrastinate. In order for me to stay on task I need someone to remind me to do my work. When I am given a project that I have no drive to complete I procrastinate until I can't anymore, some teachers remind their student s that there is a project due and that they need to finish it. When I am in those classes I tend to do the best because I am always on top of my work. There have been projects where I forget about them until the last day and then I start to work on them, most of the time I am not proud of the work that I do on those projects. So other students don't end up in the situations I have by procrastinating they should stay in a classroom so they always know when something is due.

Being in a classroom is a social skill aid. Over the years I have been in public school I have become less shy due to the amount of interaction that I must do to complete certain tasks, such as, group projects. Through those experiences I have made many friends, I even have some friends that I have known since first grade. Through these friends I have come out of my shell and I have become more confident. Through my friends I have learned that it is ok to be weird and that they will support me through any tough times. There have been situations where I have needed to help my friends interact with people and I have used the social skills that I learned in school through dealing with mean and rude teachers and in some cases rude students. Students should stay in a public classroom setting because of the valuable social skills thy will learn there that will help them out in their lives.

Students should be in a public classroom setting to develop their social skills and get reminded about the work that they need to focus on. Some may disagree with this statement but they have not thought about all of the experiences that kids would be missing out on if they took online classes. Students should not take their online classes from home.",4,Distance learning,Independent
74CC1D0FE728,"Schools around the globe have been offering distance learning classes as an option. Students would take classes at home by video calls with teachers. There is a lot of talk of whether distance learning is a good or bad idea for students. There are many pros and cons to this idea and for that, it is hard to tell. Students feel more comfortable in their own home and lessen stress. Though, students need social interaction and routine in their teen years; therefore, it is not the greatest idea.

While this idea sounds good in the first place and lots of students might want to take distance learning over going to school, it offers no social interaction to students. Social interaction with peers is one of the biggest elements to growing up, and if that is taken away they become a completely different person. While distance learning can take away stress and can let students pace their day by how they want it, it takes away one vital point of a growing teenager's life. Stress can also teach lessons of time management. Some also say there is an experience to attending school and it sticks with you for the rest of your life. If you take that away, you are taking away an experience that all students should live with for their whole lives.

The act of waking up in the morning, getting ready for school, and going through the day on a schedule gives a routine for students. Without a routine, students would learn how to be productive or manage time. It gives something for students to do and follow, and without one they would just be doing nothing at home with no idea on how to spend their time.

A school classroom usually have an amount of around 15 to 30 students in each classroom. If distance learning became standard and everyone used it, that would put a lot more work on teachers. Every student would need their own teachers, and if that were to happen you would need up to 30 times the amount of teachers there are now. Distance learning will always be limited and not every student will be able to have access to this.

Although, it can sound like a great idea to students, distance learning doesn't encourage social interaction with peers or routine to keep them moving. School is much more important to students other than academic reasons. Going to school gives many attributes and teaches students an uncountable amount of valuable lessons that are very important to them when they grow older.",4,Distance learning,Independent
1E354DDC784B,"Everyday, when it comes to school, students are always absent for whatever reason. Regardless of what the reason is many teachers still believe you should come anyway. Students would benefit from video conferencing because students will not have to worry about being absent, and students are more comfortable at home.

With video conferencing, students will be able to work most of the time. Teachers will not have to worry about students being out because they are sick. People will not have to worry about students spreading germs. Also students can get whatever they need so they can feel better at home. Makeup work will not be a problem for students because they will always know what they have to do. It will be easier for students to catch up on work that they miss since they would not have to come to school in order to get it. And students grades will stay high because they will not have any missing grades in the grade book. Also, students can have video conferences wherevever they go. If they have to go to an appointment of some sort, they can still attend all the classes. Eventhough students will need an interent connection to do this, if they can get one then students will not have to worry about missing school work wherever they are.

Students are way more comfortable at home then at school. At home, students can wear whatever they would like to wear because there is no dress code. Students will not have to worry about teachers telling them to go to the office because of their clothing. Students will not have to worry about being late because they could not find what they wanted to wear for that day. Many students also will not have to worry about bullying. Whether someone is witnessing it or it is being done to them, students will not have to worry about this since they will not be around others. Students will have less stress since they will not have to worry about bullies and become focused on their schoolwork. Lastly, students will not have to worry about supension. With video conferencing, students can not get into to fights with other students. Students can not get suspended for being late to class or for skipping school. Finally, students can not get wriiten up other things like being disrespectful to other teachers.

In conclusion, video conferencing solves many issues. Students will almost always be available to work, and even if they are abesent they can catch up easier. Students can also be comfortable at home wearing whatever they would like to wear, avoiding school bullies, and avoiding suspension. Schools should really implement this into their system so that students can benefit in these ways.",4,Distance learning,Independent

You name it they most likely have it!

You can say education has had its evolution.

Yet, one very controversial way of learning is online.

Many parents and educators are on edge about allowing their students to attend an online school.

Although many feel there is nothing to worry about when it comes to online school, here are a few things that may change your mind about taking these online courses.

School builds your skills, most of the websites online are huge scams, and being at school is, for the most part, a fun time!

Students deserve to be able to enjoy these years!

This is why students would not benefit from being able to work from home.

For one, being in school helps students with growing their skills.

Our skills are what makes us, us.

Without these skill-building assignments, students would not know how to do everyday things; for example, class presentations help students with their public speaking skills.

Many of the assignments students do in class are helping them grow as a person.

Speaking with classmates helps with their communication and people skills.

Having rules and school staff helps students build their much needed skill, active listening.

Without attending school filled with other individuals, students would not have the skills that are needed in the real world today.

To conclude, attending school is extremely efficient because it helps students build their skills.

Secondly, one key reason why attending school is the better option is because of scams.

Online can be a scary place.

There was an incident that happened in 2016, where a mother had found her 16 year old daughter on video call with what she was told was her ""online tutor"", except it was an registered sex offender.

One morning, the 16 year old girl told her mother that he was asking inappropriate questions, so her mother caught him in the act on camera and showed it to the police.

The mother was shocked because all of this happened on a website that claimed to be 100% safe.

Many parents dread allowing their children to have online school is because of this.

That just goes to show how dangerous it is to attend online courses.

Most of these websites give out false information to dumb students down which does nothing but waste the parents money.

In conclusion, online school is not the best option because of the scams they have to offer.

Others may say, students would benefit from being able to work online because students would not have to worry about the distractions like relationships, detention or suspension, or they would not have to deal with more serious issues like bullying.

Despite these reasons, home-schooling is not as beneficial because students will be missing out on a good time!

School has many fun activities you can attend.

Prom is a big one.

At school students won't just be working, they also are able to play sports, cheer, join clubs, etc.

Being home-schooled won't allow students to have the creativity or fun, as they would if they were in school.

To conclude, students should attend normal school over online for these reasons, school helps grow students skills, most of the websites online are scams, and being at school is, for the most part, a great time!

Studies have shown that 73.4% of students who attend a normal school over online grow up to be very successful!

So why not just have your children in a normal school?

030BBFC7D7F9,"In recent times, many schools have started to offer distance learning for students. Parents have voiced their opinions on the benefits and the detriments of online school. However, Students would benefit from taking online courses or video conference classes because students that may be considered unpopular may not fit into the learning environment, students may have no means of transportation to the school, and students with certain mental disabilities, physical disabilities, or medical conditions may not be able to function independently in a public school setting.

Distance learning for some students would be beneficial to their grades, mental health, and other inconveniences that come along with attending a public school. For example, my friend's brother Generic_Name was bullied all throughout elementary school and middle school and was considered an outcast by his peers. Due to this, he was always on edge while in school, causing him to fall behind in his classes. When he learned of the opportunity to complete his high school education from home, he applied immediately. Because he switched to online school, Generic_Name received better grades and was overall the happiest he had even been. Another example is my cousin Generic_Name. While in school, Generic_Name was constantly stressed by the pressure she felt to succeed placed on her by her parents, teachers, and fellow classmates. As a result, she could not focus on her studies and received disappointing grades on her report cards. Her parents learned of her situation and decided to let Generic_Name try online courses. Unknowingly, this was a great decision and my cousin felt more relaxed and got straight A's on the following report card.

For some students, getting to school on time every morning is a challenge. My best friend Generic_Name lived miles away from the nearest school and his parents had no way to take him to school and the buses did not come out as far as his residence. Therefore, he had no way to school, but if he was able to take online courses he would not have to worry about getting to school everyday. Another friend of mine, Generic_Name, lived on a secluded farm with his parents and lived too far for the buses, as well. In addition, he had to wake up very early in the morning to aid his parents with the livestock. In both cases, online courses would have been the best option and could become standard for those living far away from schools.

A video conference or online course experience would most likely be the best option for students with disabilities. As an example, a child with cancer would most likely have to be taken out of school in order to recover. However, they are missing vital information while out of school. Furthermore, children in the hospital most likely want to have the comfort of a relatively normal life. Online education would be a beneficiary to the child so it can still gain its education in recovery. Another example could be a child with cerebral palsy. Due to the child's condition, it may be hard for him of her to move around easily, so a large public school would definitely not be the greatest option for that student.

In conclusion, distance learning may not be the greatest option for the majority of students, but it would be a great option for certain students. Online school is a solution to any problem that might arise from having to attend public school, and could mean the success of a struggling students' endeavors.",5,Distance learning,Independent
F62AADC67A63,"Genuinely distance learning is a great way for students to take classes that they require. Most of the time this is due to the fact that someone in the family is part of the military or for some they are just accustomed to move around a lot. But sometimes it all just depends on the certain individual, for example if someone is a visual learner then online classes wouldnt really help because you cant understand it to the full extent. But say someone who learns just by looking at someone do something then online classes would help because the person can understand it better. Sometimes none of those are factors for someone choosing to do online classes, maybe its just that they like the isolation and peace that is hard to find in a classroom.

Online classes are beneficial for everybody especially if your someone who is busy and works a lot. Because of the classes being online then its easy to access anytime and anywhere. On the other hand if you can go to school and take the class in the classroom then i believe that is the better choice because there you can ask for help and get a better understanding then just seeing how to do it. Being in a classroom is a different ambient then working by yourself on a computer. Students would benefit from online classes or video conferencing because if they need the class to graduate and they work then it would be a perfect alternative than going to night school or doing it in class.

Schools should start to offer these opportunities to students because it would be a major help to them. It would change how some students see school and maybe try and give it another go. Most students see that they are failing and decide to just drop out because they dont want to come back to do the same class another time but if schools gave them an option to take it online then things would be different. If distance learning was an option many students would rather do it online than come to school            ",3,Distance learning,Independent
1529F615275D,"Some scools offer distance learning as an option for students. In my opinion i think students would benifet from being able to take classes from home.

To begin with, students would have a less likely chance of being bullied because they feel more comfortable at home than out where someone can make fun of them for being differnet bullying is a big issue in schools and is one of the number one issues that lead to suicide and school shootings in americ. If students have can learn from home they would be less likely to face problems like that at home.

As a reslut, some students may be fighting anxiety or depression and can not deal with all the stress that come wwith school if they are more comtorable with being home, Then they are most likely better off being home or somewhere else learning where they can focus and not worr a whole lot about things.

Letting kids learn from a distance will also make the graduation rate go up because kids wont be together to skip and kids wont incourage other kids to do drugs as much.

Last but not least, students in a group together is not a good idea because of fights and arguments. Studies show people in a crowded area are more likely to fight than in a small are because not evryone are the same they dont share the same ideals. But if students can learn in a environment that they are comfotablle with with and are not a group fight it would also solve fights in schools.

In conclusion, as we can conclude students who have a chance to have distance learning have a higher chance of making the wrong choices in lifemlike being encouraged to do drugs and have a lower chance of being bullied. Some kids also have anxiety and deppresion as result students are better off learing from a distane without any worries.",3,Distance learning,Independent
26F0870BE37F,"In the 21st century, technology has infiltrated the lives of Americans, entering into commercial, private, and education spheres. With this new spread of technological innovation, people are able to communicate over long distances. This long-distance communication and the invention of the internet allows students complete assignments online, with some even able to be digitally present in the classroom through video conferencing. However, this form of learning is not beneficial to students as it can reduce social skills and interaction, result in communication errors, and cause students to be distracted while learning from their home.

One of the main reasons attending classes from home is not a good form of learning is because it causes students to miss out on social interaction. The widespread use of technology can cause people to spend less time talking in person to someone and more time hiding behind a digital persona. With the use of video conferencing and online classes, students would not be able to have face-to-face interaction with their fellow students and would inevitably miss out on social skills that students who attend school gain. As much as school is about learning, it also teaches students how to communicate with others, how to become a leader, and how to work in a group. With the elimination of group projects, social interaction in between and during classes, and the absence of leadership opportunities, online school deprives children of their opportunity to grow their social skills. In addition, students will not be prepared for the workplace, as in a job, one has to communicate with employees and talk to their boss or supervisor frequently. With online school, a student does not have the opportunity to communicate directly with a teacher figure, learning how to express concerns, and form bonds with people that are higher up than them. Without this social skill of learning how to communicate properly with adults, a student is not fit to go into the workplace, making online school not a viable option. Due to the fact that students can hide behind a digital persona and not communicate with others due to technology, they would not be able to benefit from attending school from their home.

Secondly, with the introduction of online school, there would be miscommunication between the teacher and student, hurting the ability of students to learn. It has been shown through multiple tests and studies that technology hinders the ability of people to show emotions and convey what they are truly feeling, especially through online chatting and text messaging. This can be translated into online learning, as a student might not know what a teacher truly means through an email, causing a them to become confused. In an actual school scenario, a student would be able to talk to the teacher in person and ensure that they interpreted the information correctly. However, in online school from home, a student's ability to do this is taken away, as their teacher could be hundreds of miles away. Some might argue that with the introduction of video conferencing this lack of proper communication would be eliminated. However, with online school that could be streaming across the country, technology is subject to glitches and shutdowns. In addition, video chatting prevents the teacher from truly showing the student how to perform a task, as they are only able to communicate it verbally, rather than physically fixing it for the student. This could be present in the form of science labs. If a student is setting up the lab incorrectly, a teacher video chatting them may be a hard form of communication as the teacher can only describe to the student how to set it up, rather than actually showing them how to solve the issue in person. Therefore, video chatting is subject to miscommunication between students and teachers, not making it and online school a positive option for a student to learn from.

Lastly, a student learning from their home can cause them to be distracted, preventing them from focusing on their projects and lessons. A school is designed to create an environment that helps students focus on their classes and learning, with a set schedule, rules on phone usage and breaks, and quiet environments. However, at home it is the complete opposite, as there are multiple distractions. At home, students have distractions such as siblings, video games, and their phones, which could prevent them from giving their full attention to their schoolwork. In addition, without a set structure for online classes, it could cause students to take many unnecessary breaks, resulting in them falling behind their classmates in their classes. Next, some homes have parents working from home, pets, and young children that could create a noisy environment for a student to concentrate in. Without a proper quiet environment, a student would not be able to entirely focus on the courses they are taking. Finally, a student might ignore their school work altogether with at home classes, as with this new freedom a student would be able to meet with peers at any time, causing them to neglect their responsibilities as a student. Due to the distractions that are present at the home, online school that takes place in a student's house would not be a viable option for students to partake in.

With the addition of technology into the world, it may seem that learning from home with the use of technology is the best option for learning. However, attending a physical school and using computers as an aid to learning rather than a form of learning itself is the best option to prepare students for a digital world, as it will give them proper skills and tools to succeed along their learning journey. Because students can miss out on social lessons and skills, are subject to miscommunication, and can be severely distracted, students would not benefit from attending classes from home with the use of technology.",6,Distance learning,Independent
14F0D1DFE3B1,"Are you ready to graduate? then keep up with your good grades and finish school. Many children from k-12 learn different new things each day at school that will help them decide on the paths they want to take throughout their futures. so student should take their classes in school.

Taking in school classes can help you in so many beneficial ways. Students are able to communicate more better with their teachers in person if they have any questions or problems. Many teachers also stay after school to help other students raise their grades up by catching up on their missing assignments and give help to those who need help understanding an assignment better.

Students also learn better when they are being shown what to do in person. There are some students that are able to complete tasks or assignments by just listening to what they have been told to do, and other students who are visual learners and learn off better when someone has done an example of what they need to do first and finish without any trouble.

Finally there are some students that are too shy and unsociasble, by going to school it will make them feel more confident in themselves by getting to meet new people from all different places. become friends with others and learn new infromation about where they come from and how different it is from where they lived to now.

taking online classes is more difficult because you have to pay in order to be able to take the class you want and if you forget to take your class or do it, you can easily fall behind and being able to get help would be a struggle since nobody else is there to help you catch up on what you have missed. there are also students who go through bullying and feel like they dont belong at the school they go to and start missing school. later deciding they want to take online classes and just stay home all day.

In conclusion students should take classes in school where they could become more confident and learn self love towards themselves, being able to do tasks on their own, relate to other people who have gone through similar things as you and have people reliable to you to support you through everything, school is where the magic happens to the path of your future.           ",3,Distance learning,Independent
AF96A2176FB7,"Do you think students should have online classes at home? Do you think this will benefit the students in their life? In this paper, I will argue that students should not get online classes.

Students should not get online classes at home, because some students have to work and they are too busy to take online classes. Some people do not go to school, but they take online classes. some students work at night and they do not have time to take online classes. Students should not take online classes, because schools are for learning and home is for students to have fun, relax, and do what you want to do. Students should not take online classes, because they need to enjoy their free time while they are not in school. I do not want to take online classes, because I work at night and I do not have time to use online classes. My friend takes online classes when he is at home, but online classes took some of his free time.

Some people say, that students should have online classes because they need to focus in school and that they should start planning what they want to do when they are grown up and out of school. They are wrong, because life is not just to focus on what you want to do when you finish school, is to enjoy it and do whatever they want to do in their life. Some people want the best for their kids, but life is one and they should enjoy it.

I think in the future some students will go to school and do online classes in their free time, so they can focus on what they want. Some students will go to school, but they will not do online classes because they want to have a good career, but they do not want an excellent life like the other students.",3,Distance learning,Independent
151B0CD2ACE4,"The majority of students can say that going to school is their least favorite part of the day. This is one of the many reasons distance learning would be a step in the right direction. I believe distance learning will benefit the student body by reducing stress loads, giving students the option to do their work in a safe environment, and allowing them to ""attend"" school without having to physically be there.

Throughout the years of grade school the workload increases, but the amount of stress you are put under to get good grades also increases. Classrooms are thought of as the most boring place in the world, but really students can be distracted by a million things. The main classroom distraction is fellow classmates. On top of the constant buzz of sound put out from others speaking, there are also a massive number of times when a teacher will come into the classroom to speak with either your teacher or a student. This constant flow of people in and out of the classroom continually interrupts the lesson and makes it harder for the students to retain the information. As a society, we are in an awkward place with technology. Half of the information is still given on paper, and the other half is given electronically. This leaves room for students to lose important notes and/or study guides further stressing themselves out for an exam.

Within the last ten years the safety of students has really been called into question. Working in an unsafe environment keeps everyone in a constant state of fear. Distance learning gives the students a chance to do their work in a safe environment. There have been studies that there has been a direct correlation between bullying and low grades. By eliminating one of the ways bullying can take place, students will have a better chance of succeeding. In the most recent history, there have been more than 5 major school shootings in the United States alone. More than half of the schools in America have had a gun scare in the last 7 years. Parents take extra precautions to know their child's whereabouts because of these dangers. With parents breathing down their necks and a fear of the worst every time the school goes into lock down, students can not concentrate. Within the last 4 months, the world has been in a battle with the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Some schools have been shut down indefinitely due to the outbreak and the fear of it spreading. Students, that attend schools that do not have distance learning plans in place, are missing weeks of education. This will take a toll on their grades and exam scores.

Some students are physically incapable of attending school on a regular basis. Distance learning gives them an opportunity to ""attend"" school without having to be there. After undergoing a medical procedure, most physicians recommend time out of school to recover properly and reduce the risk of complications. One of the major reasons to stay out of school while recovering is to keep stress levels at a minimum. By missing school there will be mounds of missing work and lectures that can not be assigned if the school does not have a distance learning plan. Although the students will be given the opportunity to do their work outside of school this requires a large amount of accountability. Allowing them to do their work on their own time leave room for laziness.

Implementing a distance learning program will reduce stress levels, provide a safe work environment, and give students the option to ""attend"" school without physically being there. With these new changes the student body will thrive. Without them schools will continue to lose precious educational time.",5,Distance learning,Independent
B8D4D1B62526,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. However; the question is students would benefit from being able to attend class from home? It is seems to me that attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes at school; In addition, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers; Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. With out a doubt, school provides knowledge, values, and skills that will benefit students in their academic life, as well as, their social life.

In the first place, attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes that school offers. For example, my High School provides different types of optional classes, as Electricity, Cosmetology, Floral Design, and others, which is enthusiastic for some students. Last semester my friend Generic_Name took Floral Design Class. Generic_Name went to numerous fascinating fill trips of her Floral Design Class. Additionally, she was one of the organizer of the decoration of the Graduation Night

Generic_Name was so dedicated to her Floral Design Class that she was always talking about becoming a florist in a future.

Certainly, unlike the students that take classes from home do not have the opportunity to create talents at school that will make beneficial for their academic life.

Pursuing this further, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers. For instance, teachers, administrators, and councilors can provide support at students in their homework, classes, or even their personal lives. Ms. Generic_Name my ESL teacher she is one of the great examples of it. I am not trying to brag, but she demonstrates day by day the importance of being communicate. Moreover, every day in class as we transmit our ideas we learn more about the topic in which we are discussing and also we gain experience of her voyage to became a teacher. In fact, she always mention that strives with determination for our goals take us to denied the fears to reach the victory. Nevertheless, school plays an important role in students life.

Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. For example, students that take classes at home are procrastinators because they do not have rules, or people that can help them in their personal development, which is a important for all students. In fact, we humans are not born with all our qualities or talents. At school we can built manners, values, and skills that will contribute in our future jobs, or social life. In order to success in life we have to come to school not to stay at home.

By all counts and with proven results; there is no doubt that attend school instead of take classes from home would benefit students to identify talents and potentials, as they take different classes at school; In addition, communication between teachers and students at school is a potential key in which students gain new skills and experience by their teachers; Finally, school creates a solid foundation in students development that will persist with them for the rest of their lives. Let's take a stand together and let the parents and schools board knows that take classes at home are not beneficial for students.     ",5,Distance learning,Independent
DBF35E9F40A2,"I think students should not get the benefit on taking online classes from home.

My reason why I say that is because I feel like they're going to be easily distracted. I say that because most kids gets easily distracted in school right now. Due to phone and not turning in work on time being the time given to them . So I don't think that time the student gets home he/she is going to do the work. Beacause they're going to think of it like this.

They have 24hrs to get a couple of online/video classes done in the mean time they have only 8hrs in school to get the work done. Well at least I know I wouldve thought of it that way.

But you know some students think different about things like this some students might want get it done then and there. Not waste any other free time they may get to do any work. Like some students might take this as an advantage and get as much work done as possible so they have the extra free time other days.

And some students have jobs they might want to get they're work done in the morning and go to work come home and not have any work to do when they come home

But as I said in the first paragraph I would've thought of it different then any other scholar/students.

As an example; If I were to go on vacation and only have online classes I would get the work out of the way so i could have more fun on the vacation.

But I guess all I am really trying to say is it could really be a big debate. About if schools should offer any online classes to students or not.

they should use these options when there is bad weather or ice roads outside so that studdents do not miss there education due to the bad weather students can keep up with there classes and with there grades.

i don't agree on talking online claases for whole year while sitting home sometimes you do not know how to solve problems while sitting homw some students do not have a wifi facility at there homes how they are suppose to take classes on online if they do not have laptop or wifi at there house. all the students should come to the school if they want to get education in order to get there diploma. students who do not have any source of coming to school but they do have laptops it can help them to get there diploma while sitting home.

83BB96F966DB,"Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students would rather want to be able to work in their own comfortable environment and be able to work at their own pace.

Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home because they can work at their pace because if the students missed a day or two of school, the online class is there to provide them easy access to work they might have missed. Another point is, some students tend to much rather like to work in an environment they feel comfortable in or that they feel safe in. Lastly, It would benefit their learning skills by having a tool to use that could be helpful for them when they attend school personally.

Students working at their own pace could be helpful and beneficial to them in many ways. Having to be rushed or pressured to do work may not be the best for any grade school students. If a student missed a couple days of school, the online class is there to provide for the lesson they learned the days of or the work that was missed without the work being turned in late or graded poorly. A student being able to work at their own pace is also extremely beneficial because it gives them more time to fix imperfections and be able to ace the work that was given. Students often do terribly on work they rushed on or do terribly when they did not have enough time to finish.

Students usually tend to work better in a environment they feel comfortable and safe in. Students who dont like the environment they are in can get easily distracted in their surroundings. Being distracted can cause trouble all around. Not only does it cause trouble, It stops students from getting their work done and their peers work done. These online classes can provide them to do their work in a environment they feel that they are safe or comfortable in without having to distract themselves or anybody around them. If a student feels that they are uncomfortable in their surroundings, that can take over their mind and distract them from what needs to be done.

Having an online class for students can be a benefit their learning skills by having a tool to use that could possibly be helpful for them for when they attend public school. Online classes could teach the student another way how to solve a problem in a way public school could not. With the information they learned online, they can carry that on with them and be successful in a class they have trouble on or for future references. The online class may explain the topic another way that the school did not and makes it easier for the student to understand what they are learning.

In conclusion, students would much rather benefit from being able to attend classes from home than being able to attend public schools or having to do a class in school. These classes can help students in a way public school classes could not. Being able to work at your own pace, not be distracted while do work, and learning new topics can be helpful for somebody who needs online classes.        ",4,Distance learning,Independent
BF9ACEA631D8,"The majority of people expect is the best way students can learn is going to the school than attend classes from home, when they are taking classes online from home sometimes they never look at it or never do the work, because nobody is telling him to do the work or go to learn. If the students go to the school and they don't work, teacher can call their parents and tell as about their child.

Sometimes students need help with someting like if they don't understand or they have a lot of work, teacher can teach again and again and if the boy or girl can't get it the teacher can teach in other way, the other students can help or helping each other, also if the teacher give a lot of work students can have a partner to share the work and that way can be more easy to have the work done.

If the parents want to know if their kids are learning in school, they can ask in the school how their kids going in each classes, the teacher can send an e-mail to each parents to know his or her grades, if he need more help to learn and with that the parents can know if they are learning or not, and also the school can call the parents if their child are not going to the class and talk with their child what happen.

The parents can feel more confidents because they child are learning, teacher can teach more better than have online classes at home, they can receive more help because the teacher are their for anything they needs. And some schools has eagle block for students who need help with one class or they need more time to study. They can get textbooks and look in classe with that.

343A95F8B1A2,"Schools are a place of learning and advancing your skills like math, science, and writing. Schools were made to educate children and help the children if they are struggling in any subject. As schools advanced and provided many opportunities, some of the opporunities negatively impacts the student's learning like distance learning. Distance learning is another way of learning that lets the students take classes at home by using online chats or video conferences. Schools that offer distance learning as an option do not benetfit the students because lack of real communication, lack of performance, and distraction at home.

Schools that give distance learning have a lack of real communication between student and teacher because the student can't receive specific details or help from the teacher through just a computer. For example a student that needs help to setup a lab at home can't really get the help he or she needs compared to the students that are in class and can ask direct help from the teacher. Kids also lack of communication within students and could negatively impact the learning process. For example a class is given a project and it has to be with partners, it makes it more difficult for the other students to learn and get the assignment done when they have somebody in their group that is there but not physically there to perform. Schools that give out distance learning are having a negative impact on student's coummincation.

Schools with distance learning may see lack of performance of students who take distance learning because kids are given a opportunity to slack off a bit at home. Although, not all kids will slack off it gives the opportunity to slack off, especially to the kids that get distracted easily and aren't really focused. An example of lack of performance is students can get distracted by anything at home which impacts the students performs on his or hers work for school. Distance Learning through video chat isn't alway promised to work out, things like techincal difficulty could happen and could lead the student missing steps or important information for an assignment leading the lack of performance. Lack of performance is a possibility of distant learning although not all student will be not be affected but a majority will be.

Distractions at home definitely impact negatively on the students learning and work ethic because many things at home can get in the way of the student's education. For example problems at home ,like family issues, can be a distraction and get in the way of the childs learning. Entertainment at home is also another distraction for students who take distance learning because entertainments like tv and videogames are available to the student. If the student has a pet, like a cat and a dog, it could be a distraction to the student's learning because the pet might try to play or need to use the restroom during the student's video chat. Responibility at home are also a distraction at home because some students might have choris to do and might be fully focused if that's in the back of their mind. Distraction at home can vary and definitely have huge negative impact on the student's learning and performance throughout the video chat.

Distraction at home can be anything like responibility at home, entertainment, and pets and have a bad impact on the student's learning and performance. Lack of communication is a negative factor to the student's education and benefits because theres a no student and teacher lack of coummnication and lack of student communication. Student who take distance learning have a lack of peformance because of distractions and personal issues that may be going on at home. Although, not all student will have a poor performance but majority will have a poor performance and damage their education. Schools that off distance learning as an option for students do not benefit because lack of real coummincation, lack of performance, and distractions at home.",5,Distance learning,Independent
6B38FB57A1D3,"Students every year are increasing from skipping school. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students should all have an option to learn from home. Some people can work better with online classes or videos. Students are sometimes not in the mood to go to school or see some other people at school, if so they could stay home and learn there with their classes.

Some people can work better with online classes or videos. It can help kids if they dont really like there classes or if they are very independent. This is very neat and i think a lot of students would benefit off of it. Expertise now with this new technology some people like working on the laptops so they would like if they could sit at home and work on class. Students can also not worry about getting up early and getting dressed for school, they can just get up and get on there laptop and do there class work.

Students arent happy to go to school all the time, but with this option they can do they classes online or watch videos about there classes. At home students can be conflictual and safer. The work at home can be nice they can take breaks and eat food whenever they want, therefore they would still have to work on there class work.

however, student could always get distracted and not do there work. They can also choose just to take a day off at home so there should be a parent near to push them. Parents should be near the student while doing work so they can see what they are working on and help them if needed.

So i think thats why we should have an option if students should have online classes at home or watch videos about there classes. either or is a good thing i like the idea. Some people still like going to school so that is fine too. Like i said early parents should be in on this and be there with there kids if they do choose to stay home.                                                           ",3,Distance learning,Independent

Some schools offer distance learning as an option students to attend classes from home by away of online of video conferencing; some students take this way to learn, but the purpose to learn is get it very well. That mean this is better when you go to school with people that is already qualified to teach the stuffs you need to learn in your process, and basically, they are there for everything you need to ask them. But what happen when you take the way to learn away? there are a couple things to talk.

First, you always need to ask questions, and I think this is the most important obstacle,for example: you do not have someone to ask immediately, that is a big benefit to be in class, some people need more than one time to understand a topic or an exercise. May be in a test you need an explication for a question that you do not understand and there is a big problem. This may work when you live far away from a civilization, or you are sick with something strong and is not easy move you body. If you have to work, that is another valid reason to take some classes in your computer because you need time to make money to pay your bills.

Second,you can cheat on the quizzes or even in the big tests that the school assigned to you. If must students cheat being in the school with someone supervising, you can do it at your home too; may be take some notes out, or search in Google some answers, or call a friend with the phone, even ask to your mom or your dad in your home. That mean you are not learning and you never going to learn if you are cheating. After this, you just getting a good grade bad nothing of knowledge and that is why we need some extra help, a person who answer our questions.

Third, the work assigned to the students from the school is not too easy, those are a couple pages and some exercises to do for just one class, so you have to read and understand all by yourself and answer the questions, send that to your teacher and wait until the next document with the exact same dynamic, and that is how you are ÃÂ¨ learning ÃÂ¨, reading papers, and answer questions. Must of the students does not pass the class, the arguments from them are that no one explain very well the way that they have to do the work and when the test comes they do not know nothing. As I said, you still can ask the teacher or look for help in internet, but is not the same thing.

Finally, most of the students has to take the class again, losing all their time that they been doing putting in that class. After all that process, they understand the important to be with someone helping you and not be away from the school. A lot of teachers say that is not a good choice take distance learning, they say is hard and be alone is more difficult, but as I said, I think is good for the people who really cant assist to school.                       ",4,Distance learning,Independent
DC25CFE5EACC,"Would you rather wake up early every day just to go to school and feel grumpy every morning? Or would you attend school at your house? The 2nd option sounds better right? But,is it really that nice? Going school is more than learning about old people fighting,numbers,reading,and writing essays. Its about making friends and connecting with teachers and be more responsible. Also one importent thing about school is that its free. Online classes are expencive,hard to get used to,and impossible to work at home. This is why attending online school wont be worth it.

First of all,.online classes can go up to 150 to 200 dollars. So, some students cant afford the classes. If you want to get online classes, you must get a job and work for weeks just to pay for online classes. When you can just go to school for free. Also if you do get a job it will affect your work at school and it will affect your job. So. is it worth it?

Secend of all, students can not focus when they are at home. Cant work on your homework because your little brother is crying nonstop? Just imagine doing an online class for 90 minutes at home. Also, home is a place to rest,have free time,and spend time with family and friends. Home is not a place for school.

Lastly,online classes can be hard to get used to. You have been in a class room this hole time in school. Now you have to get used to something new. Change can be hard on students. But,now they are all by themself in there house learning how to get through this online class. Where theres no one to help you but you. I am taking an online class in my last year of high school. Its hard. Its really hard. You wont understand what to do and what not to do. Because there is nobody showing me how to do it. Its just a 3 minutes video and now i have to wright a 3 page essay. And not knowing what kind an essay to wright. Sometimes there are no videos to help you.

Some people say that online classes are better then regular school. Well they are worng. Heres why,school can help you get your commnicaion skills up and help you grow as a person. Teachers at school can help you to get through the class. In online class you dont know if you are doing something right or worng. There is no one to giude you but yourself. It is not better then regular school when you think about it. Online classes you are so limited you dont understand. At school you will have some many more opitions for you.

in conclusion waking up at 6 oclock is going to be worth it at the end. If you attend online school the only person is going to help you is you. Or you can make friends,do group activites,and enjoy every last minute if it in school.",4,Distance learning,Independent
E81B50098AAC,"In my opinion students should come to school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students,which allows the students to be irresponsibles and not to show their work to the teacher. As we can see taking classes online is not a good option to us, for instance if we dont make the time to attend the classes online, or by the time we are taking the online classes we received a text for friend we stop doing what we are doing and got distracted by the electronic devices and, others words if we come to school received classes we are going to be able to get the knowledge that we need to be great in our academic life.

I consider myself that taking online classes is not a good option for students. Some students that take online classes are procrastinators,they dont care about their homework, or they wait until the last minute to do it. The truth is, if we dont take our online classes seriously how we are going to learn. For example,

My friend Generic_Name is taking online classes and she said that taking online classes allow her to be irresponsible by not doing her homework.

Some students dont make the time to take the online classes and we just forget to take it. I wonder how we are going to learn if we dont make the time to do it. Sometimes we got distracted for something that have nothing to with the class that we are taking. However, if we have a job and we got home late, and in our mind is to get home and take the online classes, but when we get home we are so tired and we just want to go to bed, and forget about what we have to do.

The last and more important reason what we should take classes in school is, if we attend to school,we can ask questions to the teacher and he can provides us with a powerful answers and specific examples, if we attend to school that will helps us to get a responsibility to be every day at school and not to miss any important class, and also that would gives the knowledge that we would need to be great in life.

In final consideration I think students should come to school and take our classes, that way we would learn more better than taking it in online, and also that we will makes us more responsible. As we take the classes in school we will get the knowledge that we would need to success in our academic life in general we would be great in our professional life.  ",3,Distance learning,Independent
6B9F6BDE002B,"School is traditionally an in-person, multi-class, time-consuming thing that kids must attend, but what if that changed? Well, it might. Some schools are now starting to offer online school. Online school lets a person go to school online on their own time. Online school allows a person to learn through videos and take their quizzes, tests, and class work online. Online school is not the only thing some schools are introducing though. There is also a version where a student can video conference for school. Video conferencing allows someone to video a teacher and learn. There is a slight difference, but overall similar in terms of it being over the internet. With all of the changes happening in the world, could this be a major game-changer? It just might be. Online schooling offers kids to be more responsible, have less stress-induced problems, and take control of their life.

Online school can reduce stress among younger aged people in many ways such as getting more sleep, having less stress-inducing factors around them, and it gives them more time to do things they actually enjoy. Take this as an example, a young teenage girl wakes up at 6am every morning and leaves for her bus at 6:30am. She gets on the bus and talks to friends and gets to school at around 7:00. When she gets to her homeroom she feels tired, but know she has to stay awake so she won't get behind in her classes. By her last class of that day, she has taken two quizzes, got assigned homework in each class, learned she has a test the next time she goes to one of her classes, learned she has a band concert on Sunday, and learned about a project she completely forgot about that is due in two days. When she gets home, she is too tired to even think about starting her homework and takes a nap. When she wakes up she does her homework, but she barely has time to do much else that day. She can not really ask her teachers about an extension on her project because she was just stressed and forgot about it, half of the school deals with the same type of issues. If she did online school she could have gone to her classes with enough energy to put up with everything she was getting, she could potentially finish the classes earlier than she would in school, do homework, and she could still have time to finish her project and maybe even practice her instrument.

Online school could also help kids take control of their life and show them how to be more independent and responsible. If a student took online school they would have more time, which means they could do something with their extra time like get a job or help learn in real life skills that schools would not teach them. If a family was struggling financially and a kid wanted to help out, online school would be really useful because that kid could pick their own school hours and be able to manage their time around that. They could finish their school work, get job experience, and help their family out all because of online school. Another example could be, what if a kid could not take the mental toll of school, but did not want to drop out. Online school would be useful because they could take their time slowly and actually be able to learn and focus on what they are struggling with, rather than sitting lost in class and having to stay after school and waste more time trying to understand.

Like everything, online school also has its cons. If someone just genuinely did not like school and tried everything to avoid it in the first place, then obviously online school would not be for them. If a normal social person tried doing online school, it would probably be more harmful than helpful because it could lead them to shutting themselves out from not being able to meet anyone or make plans in person with anyone. Kids struggling with illnesses such as depression might not be able to keep up with the online classes and end up falling behind anyways. Online school is just a situationally helpful way to stay and learn just on the person's own time. If a students parents and teachers know a kid would not be the right fit for online school, then it would not be recommended for that kid. Overall, online school would beneficial for most students who are struggling with anxiety, sleep-induced issues, or lack of time to do anything because of traditional schooling ways. It would also be beneficial for people who have good time-management or people that want a head start for their career goals or just people who need to financially support themselves.",6,Distance learning,Independent
6C25E5BA529E,"When you need the education, but is not able to accessed from where your are, you have to resort to the next best thing, online schools. The statement made asking if it's beneficial to do online school learning at home or not, my opinion is that it is beneficial for the students to take online classes at their homes. Reasons being that for the students that may have some problems with convenience, online schooling would near completely erase that. There is the convenience of being able to learn online from almost anywhere, students being able to do the learning at their own time, and for students to have a higher chance of wanting to learn since they have the choice of when they want to learn and where they would work best in.

The first evidence is that there is the convenience of being able to learn from almost every location around the world where there is wifi or some form of data connectivity. If the student is in a location where he or she is not able to get to the school physically let it because of environmental reasons or health reasons, the use of the internet can allow them the close the gap between them and the teachers thorough a simple video face cam process. With the added benefit of being able to do it anywhere it can also attribute to their comfort, since if they are in a area where they are most comfortable learning in such as their homes, which by its self can help them learn better in a place where the student, attending the online class, is most familiar with. There is also the convenience of time, since if time is not on the students side and they miss a online class day they can simply get a recording of the session allowing he or she to catch up on the topic. There is also the near face to face conversations with the teacher through video/ face cam, since if it was a private lesson the student and the teacher can get a one on one in two different locations of the world. There are also many free online schools willing to teach for free, so if the student is not able to afford it there are still free online classes for them to take that may very well be not so different from the other online classes where you have to pay.

The second evidence of the benefits of online learning is that the student can learn at their own pace. School these days, in the modern twenty first century, can make you get up early and make you sleep very late cause of the given work loads and the amount of topics needed to be studied, leading to sleep deprivation, and it can really impact the performance you have at school which can risk your grades. Thats why the benefits of being able to do the learning at the students convenience is so important. Since the student can wake up at their earliest convenience to get rid of any added fatigued or tiredness so that the student can have the maximum efficiency to learn the topic at hand. This leads the students to have the added benefit of working better just because of getting more sleep. With the increase amount of sleep this gives the added benefit of the student willing to learn, since they are energized and ready to learn they don't have to feel that they are being forced to learn at their worst conditions, especially in a classroom setting where they may also be unnecessary tension or pressure towards the student to meet their teachers expectation there and now.

The third evidence is from my own experience, I myself have never done any online classes but I know many friends and family members who do take the online classes and most if not all have given me positive reviews of the online classes they have taken. My cousin in South Korea right now for about three to four year have been taking an online class to learn a different language. The language that my cousin wanted to learn was not a language that was being taught at her current school. So she took to the internet and had found a amazing teacher form Europe willing to teach from minimal pricing for a contract of 3 year teaching, which lead to my cousin having a good deal. Through the online lessons my cousin was able to learn her preferred language and at a low cost, which saved her financially since my cousin was a bit tight on money, and allowed her to learn at home the environment of where she feels the most comfortable at, since is South Korea comfort is a necessity in a academically competitive country. It is not just my cousin numerous friends of mine, who took online classes, have told me that taking a online class at their homes increases the sleep and convenience while decreasing the work load for them at the same time, also allowing them to go over the given notes or materials constantly instead of having to continue on without knowing the material, which makes them want to do the class more, also the online classes have allowed my friends to come to a near face to face experience with the teacher of the online class they were taking.

With that being said, through the many added benefits of taking online classes at home. It allows the student to have the convenience of being able to take the class anywhere with wifi or data connectivity and getting the maximum amount of comfort in their own homes, allowing the students taking the online class to do the work at their own time to ensure that the student is ready to learn at their best shape possible during the day, and the evidence of my family member and friends enjoying the convenience of the online class/classes they are taking at home making them want to do the online class even more. So are online classes taken at home beneficial or not, with the evidence and reasoning given I think it is safe to say that it is beneficial.",5,Distance learning,Independent
61EDBF8CEC7D,"Do you get boerd being at home all the time? Well, imagine having to go home and take classes online. Some say, students benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video confrencing. On the otherhand, others suggest that students taking classes online can cause lot's of distraction, being anti-social, and giving an oppurtunity to cheat on a subject without getting true help, and support from a teacher in school.

We all like being on social media and communicating with our friends and family whenever we have the chance. But, texting your freinds and trying to do your work at the same time can be a huge distraction. However, if a student is giving an advantage to take classes online, it will cause a student to get off task and go on their phone without having the right discipline like a regualr school would have.

In a regular school, students would have the oppurtunity to communicate with their peers. For example, if a teacher assigned a project for the class and told them they are able to work in groups. This wouldn't only count as a grade but, being able to be social with your classmates and not being able to do the work independently. Which is a great idea so that it wouldn't cause a student to be ant-social.

Finally, giving a student the advantage to take classes online will give them the idea of going to a different website and finding the answers to the question. Ironically, that's what a student would do if they had the chance to. But, would it be helpful to ask for guidence, from someone who can actually give you some ways to help make you understand the topic. Not being able to get that type of help can be stressful and cause you to cheat.

In conclusion, taking classes online isn't a bad idea if wanting to finish school faster. But, it can also cause you to get distracted , anti-social, and not having the ability to get proper help when struggling with a specific topic.                ",4,Distance learning,Independent
6783CF0808E5,"The public school system has several benefits. One of the major ones is the fact that children ages 5-18 get free education. That being said, it can be hard for students to take a true advantage of the free education system because it can be quite strict. A major issues is school attendance. Most students are in school from 7am to 2pm five days a week which can become quite hard to maintain, especially when a student is out sick. Another issue is learning. In general students all learn differently and for the most part the public school system tends to only teach material in one or two different ways. Having classes from home could be beneficial to students by allowing them to be present even when sick, allowing them to be comfortable during the school day, and allowing them to learn in their own way.

Coming down with the flu or a common cold is something no person wants; it makes a person feel terrible and causes them to miss important events. In elementary school or even middle school coming down with a cold was never that big of a deal but as students begin to enter high school it can be very challenging to stay on track with work even if the student is only out for one or two days. Not only are they having to make up homework, classwork, and tests that they may have missed but now they have to continue to stay up to date with their present work; along with after school clubs, sports, and maybe a job a students can begin to fall behind extremely fast. With students having the access to classes at home this issue is barley a concern. Students will be able to see their lesson plans at any time of the day and have the resources to complete them correctly while doing it for their own bed. Now, having classes online doesn't mean that a student will want to finish all of his/her work while out sick, but it does reduce a lot of stress from their workload.

Being comfortable is a big part of learning, if a student is in pain, too hot, too cold, or anxious it can cause them to not comprehend materials as well as they could. Being around a large number of people, public speaking, group work, fights etc. are all reasons why students may feel uncomfortable at school. Wearing what they want, being able to go outside, eating what they want, using the bathroom when they want, and having the ability to take time to rest are all reasons why students would feel more comfortable in their own home. These comparisons don't speak for all students but in general being comfortable plays a large part in how people get work done. Making it beneficial for schools to have the option of accessing classes online.

Being comfortable physically is a important to a student's learning, but so is being comfortable mentally. This means a students should feel able to learn at their own pace and in a way they feel works best for them. Teachers all have different types of teaching strategies including just taking notes, interactive work, PowerPoint, group work, presentations, or combining all of these. For many students they may resonate with one of the strategies but what about the six other classes they take? One might excel in math because they find it very easy to understand the teacher but that same person might fail history because they don't understand the notes they are handed. With classes from home students don't have to take the risk of succeeding in one or two classes and struggling in the rest. Students will be able to see the lesson and find what works for them in order to understand the lesson. No matter if that is through reading, watching videos, playing interactive games, taking quizzes etc. the student will have the option to explore what works for them.

Even though there are a lot of benefits to having the ability to access classes online people may argue that going to school is still better for the student then staying at home. Public school provides the student with the opportunity to be social throughout the week, develop structure and authority in a students life, and show them responsibility. Even though this is true learning is still a different journey for every student. So, while some students may enjoy going to school others find it extremely difficult. Which is why having classes from home could be beneficial to a student because it allows them to be on top of their work even when out sick, comfortable while learning, and having the ability to learn at their own pace. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
71C866E275D9,"We live in a modern era where screens and technology are everywhere, but school can be an escape from all of those for many students. Students would not benefit from attending classes through online video conferencing. This is because looking at a computer screen would negatively affect their eyesight and health, teachers would not be able to physically help the students if they are miles away from one another, and also because this would absurdly decrease interaction between students, therefore harming their social and conversational skills.

Every year, new studies are conducted on how television and phone screens harm not only our eyes but also our mental and physical health. Most teenagers and young adults spend multiple hours a day watching television, playing video games, or scrolling through their phones when they are bored and it negatively affects them greatly. Playing video games and watching television for too long has been linked to the killing of brain cells and also to decreased physical health because instead of getting exercise or playing outside, some would rather play on their computer or binge watch an entire television series in one sitting. My parents encourage my sister and I to go outside or play a board game instead of wasting our time re watching multiple episodes of

The Office on Netflix, but we just nonchalantly shrug off their advice and make up an excuse as to why we cannot, or do not, want to do so. From my own personal experience, after a few hours of focusing on a movie or a video game my eyes begin to hurt because of the immense strain that I have put on them and they continue to sting for multiple hours afterwards, sometimes making it difficult to fall asleep, let alone stay asleep.

Secondly, students that would attend school through video conferencing would not be able to access the personal touch and inter activeness of being within reach of a certified educator. I have struggled in many subjects before, but whenever I did not understand a subject or a certain lesson, I was always able to ask my teacher for assistance and explanations which helped greatly increase my understanding afterwards. I have stayed after school and received help during lunches on multiple occasions and after every tutoring session, I felt content in knowing that I reached out and got the help that I needed. However, this would not be an option for the students that decide to stay at home and attend online schooling. While explanations can be given through computer screens, only so much can be completely understood. For example, if there was a science lab held at school while a student was attending through the internet, that student would not possibly be able to experience and perform the lab that many others would because of their physical absence from the classroom. This is why physical attendance has always been a requirement and I do not believe that should change any time soon.

Lastly, if students were to attend school and receive their education through video conferences, then they would miss out on being socially active with other students and also on being a part of tradition. For almost a century, going to school and making friends and memories is an amazing journey that a great majority of our parents and grandparents experienced and want us to experience as well. People thrive on interaction with other people. Whether it be a long, heartfelt conversation or a brief one with few words spoken. When I am sick or under the weather and stay at home, I dreadfully regret it because I miss my friends and sometimes I become so bored of not being at school that I actually miss learning, too. You also cannot physically attend events during school if you are not present to do so, making it very difficult to enjoy other student's company and make memories because all you will every remember is sitting in an office, staring at a screen with no one to talk to, laugh with, and enjoy your teenage years with, and I do not believe that anyone should have to experience that, even if it is what they think they want.

However, it is understandable to want to be able to attend school through video conferencing. Video conferencing would allow students to stay in the comfort of their homes and to also wear practically whatever they would like to, like pajamas or baggy sweatpants. Attending through a video conference could also be very beneficial for those that are sick or unable to make it to school regularly. While these may seem appealing enough to want to have this option for your school, these benefits do not outweigh the negative costs of having little to no social interaction, having no personal, in person help from teachers, and also how it affects your health, both mental and physical.

In conclusion, implementing and allowing students to not physically attend school would not be beneficial for the students and therefore should not be considered. Allowing students to choose to learn from home should not be an option because it would negatively affect their social skills, their overall well being, and also put their grades and future at risk. Students need to enjoy school and think of it as a fun learning environment where they make memories with people they care about and love. Schools should not offer the option of attending through devices such as computer or phones because of these many reasons and more.                                                                                                                               ",6,Distance learning,Independent
2285E3878B94,"Over the years distance learning has become more of a norm. Many people used to consider online school to be lesser than physical, but the results that have come from online have shown to give positive and effective results. Students would benefit from attending classes at home giving them more of a stress free environment and more flexibility.

When many people think of online school they might quickly jump and think that there are a lot of negatives and that physical school would ideally be the better option for students, but when you compare the two options you would be surprised as to what online school provides. In recent years school has never caused so much stress or anxiety to students. Students receive this stress from many factors like peers that compare themselves to one another, which causes a sense of competition and comparison for the student to think that they are not ""as smart"". There is lots of stress from society as well in the youngest generation, pushing them in that they have to be successful, the top of the class, and this is caused by schools and peers. With online school, it provides the student to work in an environment they feel comfortable in, and by being at home or some other environment they are less in risk to be stressed out and compare themselves to other students with academics. Students can also work at their own pace and thoroughly understand the information they are learning, which positively enforces learning. When students are pushed on this one idea, and it is heavily forced upon them, they are likely to resent it. With this stress, it can cause students to start to hate learning, and give that sense of resentment towards the school system. Pushing students so much can cause burn out, which can give long term effects on a student with heavy disregard for school and education as a whole. This environment has only increased over the years, and has already given effects like mental health issues shown in students.

Online school allows students to learn the same information, but in an environment that will suit them better or provide the comfort of less pressure to the child. Some may say that will too much comfort, the student will start to slack in school. Though the student can choose when to start school and their own hours, they need to complete a certain amount a day to stay on course, and though it also depends on each student, majority show positive results and that they stay on track with their courses by being somewhere they feel comfortable and more a ease to. Each student has a unique situation so it also depends on that, for example, many students start to pursue their careers or are able to follow their dreams early. By having online schooling, kids are able to do this and it gives them flexibility in their schedules' for school and to continue with their dreams. Many student athletes that are on the road to the Olympics, or students that have started a business and that do not have the time to go to school for most of the day, will take online schooling to focus on those other things. Many people might think that is being a bad student not prioritizing school, but many students already have gotten a jump start to their future and don't need to be attending full time schooling, or just physical school. People like Micheal Phelps, and Simone Biles would not be as successful as they are today if they did not switch from attending physical school to online school, and it goes to show that you can do online school and still be just or even more successful. This option of having online school for these types of students is highly beneficial by giving them that flexibility.

People will make the argument that online school doesn't provide the needs for student education or the interaction and relationships they get from school, but if a student is having trouble learning online, they can video chat an actual teacher to get help and talk to a teacher, just like they would if they went physically to school. The student would not be teaching themselves, they would have assistance and support from real teachers if they need explanation or other help. The education portion of online schooling is very similar to physical, but there are huge mental differences for the student. Online provides the proper aid and positive mental health responses from the student allowing them to still enjoy school and education. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
F67D6B12D494,"Multiple studies have shown learning from home is extremely beneficial. Students receive more sleep, are one task, and there are less distractions. Most children do not obtain a full 8 hours of sleep that is recommended. Causing students to be more likely to sleep during instructional time. When students study at home it is very likely that their parents will hold them accountable for their assignments and or class work. Students tend to listen to their parents rather than a teacher, because most children see their parents as someone of authority and power. When students learn at home there are less distractions that can stray the child away from the task at hand. Overall learning from home can be very beneficial if it is done the right way, and with the right amount of strictness and regulations.

Every student can benefit from more sleep, because most do not get enough sleep as it is. Almost every school system obligates students to wake up somewhat early to attend school. Most likely students do not want to be there because they are extremely exhausted. Some students are detrimentally tired that they feel like they have no other choice but to sleep in class. That is where learning from home is beneficial, because students can attend class online or by video conferencing on their own time. It makes it convenient for students to actually complete school work. If students are well rested they are usually much more efficient than when they are sleep deprived. Students who attend school at home receive more sleep. Which results in an efficient student whose work is completed diligently.

When students learn from home they are either learning online or are video conferencing. Which makes it difficult to ignore your teacher when they are online with you. It is a bit difficult to stray away from from your task if you are learning by this method. Students would need to deliberately detach themselves from their device so they could stray away from their class work. Video conferencing is a great way to keep students on task, because they can not run away from their responsibilities if a teacher is video conferencing them. It forces the students to focus and work more diligently. Parents might also play a similar role as the teacher by holding their child accountable for missing assignments. In theory it is very easy to keep a student on task by using this method, because it supplies a scenario in which a child can not avoid class work.

Most people have a hard time focusing when their friends are around, especially when it comes to school work; The same goes for students. When children around their age are constantly talking to them or trying to play with them during instructional time it becomes an issues. The student can not focus therefor they can not learn. Resulting in the student falling behind. When the time comes for a test or a quiz the student has absolutely no idea how to complete the exam. Consequently failing the exam, and possibly end with a failing grade for the marking period. If the student began online classes there would be a less likely chance of the student failing, because they have designated times to spend playing with friends and for school work. The student still has the possibility of being distracted but the possibility has lessened because they have less room for distractions. This results in a better performance of the student for example, their grades could improve.

In conclusion attending school from home has many perks that your student could benefit from. Not every student is the same, but every student has possibly experienced negative situations that could be avoided by attending online school. Online school and video conferencing helps your child become independent, diligent, and hard working. Every student can benefit from more sleep, less distractions, and strategies that help students stay on task. Overall every student can benefit from this method in many ways; It is easy efficient and straight to the point and it puts less stress on teachers and parents.",5,Distance learning,Independent
1308F5C3347E,"Students would benefit from being able to attend classes by way of video confrencing or of online resources. Not everyone who wants to take the class may not be able to physically take the class as a result of too many other students. Students may also work efficently when they are in their own work enviroments. Lastly, if a student needs help but is too shy to get help or doesn't have enough time in the day to get help from a teacher, an online class can give them the help that they need.

Sometimes students feel as if they can work better when they are not at school. Students may feel like the home or another workspace enviroment is comftorable and may fit all their needs. They are not restricted by the rules of the classroom and can take breaks whenever they feel like it. If they are too sick to go to school or are travelling they can still get work done and not get left behind. At home they may be more relaxed than whatever they get in the classroom. Students would be able to feel more in control of how they work and their own work ethic, both of which they may never have gotten in school.

Class sizes are usually limited and not everyone who registers for a class can take be enrolled. There are always students who wanted to take a class but were unable to get in that class and are forced to take it next year on account of losing another class oppurtunity. The students who are unable to get in that class are usually forced to take a class that they wouldn't have done so otherwise. With taking that same class online many more students can take it and have complete access to all the resources they would need. This means that students would not have to take classes that they had no interest in and are able to take all the classes they want the next year.

Students who are too shy or can't get help would be greatly benefitted by online classes. In schools shy students may never talk or not be able to get help from a teacher and therefore their grades suffer. Online they may have a better chance at one-on-one time with their instructors to get the help they need. By way of video conferencing many students can help eachother out and therefore not take the group work out of school learning. If they can't get in touch with their teacher, students still have the entire internet at their disposal. Students will be able to acess forums, databases, and videos filled with the answers to all their problems. Students who were originally unable to get the help they required would now be able to gain the necessary concepts required for that specific topic.

In conclusion giving students an option for distance learning would be beneficial to their careers. This way of learning would be able to provide better learning enviroments for students. It would also allow students who would not have been able to be in the class, the ability to still be in the class. Students who wouldn't have been able to get help from a teacher would be able to get all the help they would need by way of online or video conferencing.  ",4,Distance learning,Independent
5E5507D2C91E,"In this modern era of easy access to technology, children are heavily influenced by the electronic world into which they immerse themselves. Thus, the younger generations are growing more familiar and comfortable with technology than their own parents and grandparents will ever be. In well-endowed school districts, students often have Chromebooks, Macs, or another brand of a small, portable laptop. It becomes easier to teach students with online material when each and every child has his or her own school-issued device, and other schools have gone as far as to implement distance-learning, a form of education offered through the accessibility of technology. Distance-learning, while heavily reliant on electricity and technology, is greatly beneficial to students because it would both allow those who are not able to attend school due to sickness and reach those who live far away from a learning institution.

Sickness spreads easily in a crowded, public environment where many tools, like pencils, scissors, and desks are shared. Students often cannot afford to miss school due to illness, so they will attend anyway, no matter the severity of their sickness. Even with the addition of laptops into education, missing a day of learning has the potential to impact student learning because he or she is not present for the teacher's lecture and explanation of material. Through distance-learning, students who are sick would be able to connect with the class and teacher in real-time and be able to ask questions to further his or her understanding. If the student was in the hospital, having come down with a more serious illness, like pneumonia, he or she would likely miss out on a few concepts from class but later video chat with a teacher while simultaneously not missing out on medical attention.

Students who live far away from their school would also benefit from in-home learning. Those who live in more rural parts of a school district often have an early wake-up call for a long commute riddled with morning rush-hour traffic. Then, in school, the student is already mentally exhausted and must prepare for the long trek home. Distance learning would eliminate the commute for faraway students, saving them money in gasoline and time in transit. They would also not need to wake up as early and go to bed as late, allowing for a healthier sleep schedule. Many students take part in before- or after-school activites, like a sport. Elite swimmers practice before the sun comes up each morning, hurry off to school for a few hours of learning, then head back to the pool for a second practice or weight routine. Balancing athletics, school, and sleep can prove difficult, especially during end-of-season competitions that run during school days or weeks. But with distance-learning, student-athletes would be able to catch up on missed work while they were absent and have the oppurtunity to ask their teachers questions when they return.

However, distance-learning is not a perfect solution; it sets up a heavy dependence on electricity and wireless connectivity. In times of inclement weather, like a thunderstorm, high winds, or heavy ice, power lines can be knocked out, disconnecting students reliant on their laptop to learn. While inclement weather always carries with it the chance of a school cancellation, some school districts are more prepared for such catastrophes. For example, Minnesota and New York are often slammed with horrendous snowstorms that bring several feet of snow, but these northern states come prepared, bringing their snowplows out in full force and working around the clock to ensure that the roads are safe. Students who live in areas of extreme temperatures and weather are prepared to brave the dangers of the outside. So, students learning from remote areas will then be missing out because are unable to learn, while those physically in school will continue on unaffected. Furthermore, learning at home can prove difficult for those who find it hard to focus. Going to school provides a different, somewhat unfamiliar environment in which students are not constantly distracted by everything. At home, the television, fridge, and bed can all take students' focus from learning. Students who decide to learn from home ought to be dedicated, keep themselves engaged in their virtual classrooms, and able to ignore the pulls of the soft bed with fluffy pillows and the fridge with its store of delicious food.

Distance-learning will provide another option for students who are otherwise unable to learn in the traditional classroom setting. It will be not for the lazy but rather the driven, responsible, and committed, since not everyone possesses the level of focus required to drown out the sounds of distraction. Technology has become easy to use and relatively inexpensive, and as a result, it has introduced options that previously did not exist. In the world of education, techonology will increase the quality of learning for those everywhere. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
30C58EE38D16,"Students in modern day face many challenges in their education. Many people have had creative ideas on how to remove these problems from the lives of all students. For example, many kids do not eat breakfast before school because of financial problems, so schools give out free breakfasts to students to make them more attentive and productive. One new idea states that schools should offer distance learning. This means that some students would have the opportunity to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing with their school. Although some people believe that allowing students to attend classes from home would benefit the students by making education more accessible to students who are farther from the school, offering distance learning would not benefit students because distance learning makes education very expensive, harder to understand, and have less social aspects.

Firstly, distance learning would not benefit students because it makes education very expensive. Many students rely on the free technology supplied by the school, such as laptops and calculators, for their education. This is important for students who would not be able to afford computers and calculators, and puts all students on an even field for learning. But a new wave of expenses would occur if students could take online classes. Firstly, the technology needed would have an astoundingly high cost. The school would have to buy many new monitors for their classrooms. The school would have to buy microphones for all of the teachers so that the students to be able to hear the lessons. Keeping all of these expensive pieces of technology running require a massive amount of chargers. Technicians would need to be hired in order to fix all the problems in the computers, and the school would generate a large electrical bill. Many expenses also apply to students. While students would be able to use their school computers to watch lessons from their home, they would have to buy their own microphones and chargers. Secondly, one central component of technology is a strong internet connection. Many schools have a free internet connection that students are allowed to use while they are at school. If students needed to use their computers from home for their entire education, they would require a strong connection to the internet. Many people who rely on the supplied technology and internet access from the school are not able to pay for fast internet access at their homes. Students with a poor connection at their homes would receive a poor connection to the lesson, and would not be able to fully understand the information that the rest of the class was given. These costs create an expensive alternative for both the school and the students that not everyone would be able to pay for.

Secondly, distance learning would not benefit students because it make the information harder to understand. Schools and classrooms create a learning environment that makes receiving help easy and cuts out distractions. If students watch the classes from their homes, their learning environment has neither of those. Firstly, students would have a much more difficult time asking questions and receiving help. If the student does not buy a microphone, they would not be able to talk to the teacher and would have to explain questions through emails. This way of communication is much less effective because neither side would be able to explain themselves as well as they could in real life. Secondly, homes have many more distractions than classrooms, which can affect how well the students focus. In a classroom it is mostly quiet, and distractions such as talking, using phones, and listening to music are banned. This makes the students pay attention to the teacher and the lesson. While at home the students can not be monitored as closely because the teacher is not able see what they are doing. Many noises such as traffic and people outside can distract the minds of the students. With the combined lack of supervision and many distractions, students that learn from home can never learn as well as students that learn at school. Thirdly, many scientists, colleges, and organizations have studied the factors that contribute to an efficient learning. One main result that almost all researchers can agree upon is that students remember things better when they write information down. Many teachers agree with this and make their students write their notes down on paper. Students in a distance learning program would not have to write down their notes because their teachers would not be able to see if they had or not. Students who learn from school are able to better understand their material due to many factors that students at home do not have.

Thirdly, distance learning would not benefit students because it has less social aspects. Social activities include sports, clubs, and student organizations, and also friends. It is important for students to have a balance between their educational and social lives. Without them, students would be less interested in school. Students who attend school online do not have these opportunities.

Most colleges look for students who have both good grades and good social lives in their communities. Having both a strong education and a strong social presence in their community shows to colleges that the student is able to function well in the world and will be more likely to succeed.

In conclusion, students who attend classes from home have a large learning disadvantage because the program makes education expensive, harder to understand, and without social aspects. If more students use distance learning programs it will only resolve in a poorer school and a poorly educated youth. I hope that students will make the smart decision for both them and their community, and continue to learn in a productive environment that will educate them properly.",6,Distance learning,Independent
46A196DFB54F,"Do students have lees benefit if they attend school?

As we can see teenagers have many option some of them to attend class everyday, but some schools let teenager to choose if they want to stayed in home while they are having class online or video conferencing with a teacher, What benefits teenagers have if they stayed in home?

Those students who attend school they have wake up early and they don't have to miss school or they are going to miss a lot of information from days that they are absent some of them dropout from school early because they feel pressure we all this things and they don't have the opportunities to graduate, Also another thing the school is to far from their home and they not want to walk or waiting in the bus stop cause sometimes the buses came late and they think that time is wasting or they got a problems in school and they don't want to come but still graduate to have a better future. students have many reason why they always choose to take classes in online.

Most of the parents thinks that is better idea that their children takes the classes from home because they feel is more safe for them and they can be out trouble and be caution at whatever situation in the school can happen ,they can graduate more easily and fast .Parents always look for the good of their children they always thinks what would to happen to them if they are not inside of the house who can hurt them in school, parents thinks is more easily for them.

Teachers said that those teenagers who takes classes in online they can get more lazy and maybe they don't know what they doing cause students always need an adult to help them to understands and explain the topics or problems that they have to solve, Also they think if students attend school they develop much better and are more prepare and discover more than the things that they already know.

Most of the people agree that students have the same benefits if they take the online class because is the things that school teach to a every single students,Also we have people who disagree for the reason that they have to pay for those classes and think they are wasting money for no reason because they have public school that can teach them and not paying nothing so they can graduate and can go to college or the university .

Every single person has a different opinion about taking class from home and their benefits is we looking we are going to know that is the same thing if we pay attention and be careful what we are doing we can reach the goal that we want and make that same thing that we do in school just little different but always is going to be the same benefits. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
5D67E6FF363D,"Schools have been providing online classes for students very recently. The number of students attending schools have risen up because of this feature. Individuals are able to be present and learning wherever they may be during an online course. Students will greatly benefit from taking online courses because they are able to stay in a comfortable environment, have a greater number of resources, and they are able to learn at their own pace.

Home is where comfort lies within learning. Being able to learn in a comfortable environment is what a lot of sessions at a school lack. School is supposed to be mainly about learning, but most people find it extremely difficult to focus because of the others around them. Home is a place where no one will judge one another or have to worry about anything other than the task at hand. Some people say that working at home is not a great place because of the distractions of electronics. In regards to that, people are able set those electronics away from them or give them to their guardians to help them focus entirely. It allows for a reward at the end of their studies to be present for motivation to continue to work as well. I was given the opportunity to be able to take an online lesson in high school for Pre-Calculus. I was able to have less distractions from being around others during this time, This allowed for greater results on the quiz later in the quarter.

Backpacks are not able to carry everything a student might need for all of their classes. This is why students have to pick and choose what can go with them and what can't. By taking online classes, students are able to have their desired resources right by them. I was able to use all my materials that I possessed when learning online. Materials, such as textbooks and notebooks that I was not able to keep in my bag, were able to grant a greater understanding of the lesson. For an essay, I knew there was an instance of that prompt in an old book I read, but

I did not have that book with me to be able to do that part during class time. This caused for a invaluable use of time during the class because I was not able to use everything I would've been able to if I were taking an online course.

School teachers tend to go at the pace of the class' average. Everyone doesn't have the same learning speed, so most people need more or less time to master the topic that was given. Online classes give you the ability of spending as much time needed for each of the topics by watching the lesson over again. My younger brother takes online lessons since he is faster at learning topics online than in class. It allows for him to spend less time learning the same things he already understands online, while asking about new things during class time.

Online courses are beneficial for students because of the familiar working space, they'll have plenty of materials available to them, and their personal learning pace is able to be utilized. Working in a comfortable, familiar environment allows for a student to stay focused on what they need to accomplish. By having all the materials students might need for an assignment, their quality of learning and work tend to rise. Pacing is extremely important for one's understanding of a topic as a whole. Courses that are given online are very useful in a mastery of a subject overall.",5,Distance learning,Independent
667499205A97,"Schools should offer online classes or video conferences because students could do their work when they're not at school, and it would save the school money; however, there would be a higher chance of them cheating.

First, if the student is not able to get to school, they could do there work at home. Sometimes, students also have family vacations during school; therefore, the students could work on vacation. My friend Generic_Name misses school all the time because of family events. Generic_Name's school offers online classes, which means Generic_Name can turn in his work even though he is not at school. Students would have more time to complete their work since they can do it after school. Students would be more likely to turn in their work with the extra time they have to finish it; the students would then have better grades and actually be able to keep their grades high.

Secondly, online classes would save the school money. Schools that have some classes that only online could save money because they would not need to hire more teacher. That means the school would have ore money to improve the school itself and make the online classes more effective. Schools could even charge a small fee for online classes, so that way the school would be making a small profit. Generic_Name's school has managed to buy all kinds of new equipment for charging for online classes, for example: laptops, desk, gym equipment, snack vending machines, desk, and chairs. Generic_Name's school still has extra money to spend on the classes.

However, it would be easier for students to cheat on assignments. Students have access to more website at home than when they are at school. They could also get someone else to do their work for them. Most of the time schools probably won't realize the student has cheated. If the schools buy the students laptops; they could block access to some websites, therefore, making it harder to cheat and easier to see what websites the students are viewing.

In conclusion, schools should have online classes because students could do their work at home, and it would save the school money; however it's easier for students to cheat. Having online classes would be very helpful to school. It would bring in a small income and allow more kids to learn. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
D1ACADAC5ED4,"School is not exactly something everyone looks forward to nowadays. Teenagers are depressed, anxious, and some incredibly sick. It is so difficult to avoid some of the negative things in life when a student is constantly surrounded by peer pressure and bullying. If given the choice, many students would most likely choose to skip school and stay at home. However, if a student was given the option to attend classes from home, it would be beneficial. This is because it allows those who get sick to stay caught up and protects those who get bullied and assaulted in school.

First, online classes by way of video conference are very helpful to those who are sick because they are still able to be taught by a teacher. Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a ""normal"" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids.

Video conferences and attending classes online are also beneficial to a different demographic, those who are bullied and assaulted. To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn't happen to them again. The book

Speak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn't done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do.

Some may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. But, everyone has people they interact with outside of school. Whether it be in the neighborhood or at church, there are many other ways to get your social fix in. Take home-schooled kids, for example. They might be home alone all day trying to get their schoolwork done, but home-schooled students have these groups called co-ops. These co-ops are groups of other students that are home-schooled that come to learn altogether. This helps those who are home-schooled get themselves some time with other students.

There are many benefits to having another option for students who are sick and kids who get assaulted and bullied. Many of today's societal issues, whether it be new illnesses spreading or more and more students getting hurt and going to school in fear, affect a teenager's school life. The less focused we are on the issues going on outside of school, the more we are able to focus on what could impact our future. School is vital to our future in today's world, and the administration needs to realize that there are things taking away our focus from school. Teenagers are the future of this world, and the past generations need to realize that things are different that they were in their time. Would you want your children to go to school living in fear? Well, they already are.",6,Distance learning,Independent
EB29E13CF6D7,"With the increasing use of technology in our modern society, we are able to communicate with people all around the world and create a united global community.

But with all the technological advances in today's society we often tend to stray away from our more traditonal practices. One example that comes to mind is school, with technology and the internet becoming more accessable to others, schools are now considering offering online classes that students can take at home. While some might support this idea, arguing that the comfort of home creates the perfect environment for students to learn. I have to disagree.

I feel that distance learning would not benefit students. While I do agree that a home setting would make students feel comfortable, it can be argued that comfort was never a necessity when learning. We come to school to be in a learning environment full of discomforts that keep us on edge and focused, we are rarely ever relaxed. As I am writing this right now there is a student next to me who keeps chewing very audibly on his finger nails. It is in this situation that I am more motivated to finish my work and to get out of this room, as he is making me very uncomfortable.

But to only base my argument on one aspect of my learning environment would be foolish. We must also consider the distractions we may have at home. While our schools and classrooms are designed to have minimal distractions in them, our homes are not. Often times I find myself sitting in my room trying to do my homework, but more often than not, I am distracted by objects that are cluttered on my desk. Now you could say that this argument is very situation based, but there are plenty of other things that I can list off. Things like family, friends, pets, and cell phones. There is also the fact that there are no teachers at home to keep us in check so that we don't get distracted. As a student with a learning disability, I often find that my ADHD pulls my attention away from my work. But never in my twelve years of being in the education system, have I found myself more distracted in a school setting, than a home setting.

There is also a problem with the way of learning that online classes mandate. By looking at a screen and reading or watching videos, students aren't as engaged as they would be if they had a class discussion or socratic seminar. Students learn not only by teachers, but also by sharing ideas with each other and building upon what their peers say. One of the best ways of learning is through communication and sharing ideas. I specifically love learning this way as it is what a real world setting would look like. A group of minds that either agree or disagree on a topic all coming together to rationalize and create one centeralized idea. The kind of learning where all a teacher has to do is stir our minds so that we may learn on our own. A computer can't do that, all it can do is collect information, not create. We do not learn from computers, all we do is relay the information that is given to us, that isn't learning, it's just memory. Online classes do nothing but exchange the experience of learning and coming to school for the comfort of staying home.

While I do feel that technology has tremendously improved the learning experience for students, I feel that too much of it could end up hurting more than helping. The problem with computers is that they all ""think"" the same way, while students evidently do not. You just can't replace the learning relationship between a student and teacher, or a student and their peers, with something that is artificial. You cannot replace the perfect learning environment filled with simplicity, for one that is littered with distractions. Finally, you cannot recreate the discomfort of audible chewing noises, in an environment that was tailored specifically to comfort you.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent
51EF8C7D4263,"Yes, I think students would benefit from being able to attend class from home, because they can be responsible to attend classed from home, always learn new things, and always study.

First of all, be responsible to attend classes from home because there is a lot of people that are not responsible on their education especially attending classes from home. For instance, someone being home school needs responsibility.

Second of all, students always learn new things while they are being attended classed from home. For instance, while they are paying attention on the things they are teaching to the student theirs always new things to learn and interesting things to know what is about.

Third of all, always study on the things they might ask you on. For instance, you might take quizzes just to know how much you know on the things you learned.

Finally, get your work done on time so you can be able to pass and start on new things. For instance, if you don't get your work done on time you will be behind and not be able to pass on the new things to learn.

6.15E+11,"You ever wonder if there are any benefits on being home schooled? Schools are offering students the option to be able to take their courses from home but what good does it do? In reality, having students attend a school is a far better option. By having students attend a school they are able to gain social, collaborative, and different learning skills.

Being able to gain social skills will ultimately helps one's life. By attending a school Students are able to break out of their shell and be able to express themselves in many different ways. Presentations would build their communication skills that could help them in the future for a job interview or a meeting at work. Students would start to get comfortable with the idea of presenting to an audience and would get to speak to them without an issue. Schools also allow students the opportunity to meet different types of students that might end up being their friends. From past experiences having someone to be with throughout a school year is honestly a great moment. Not only do students get to have fun and be kids but they get to watch each other mature, which would strengthen their bond. Students are able to build off of experiences they have went through or from others so they could grow from them and try to better themselves.

Collaborative skills is a great ability for students to have. Schools do provide the opportunity for students to grow their collaborative ability and make it their own. For example, there is a high school course called ""AVID"" which teaches students to use their collaborative skills for questions they dont understand. Students ask questions that might lead them to find an understanding of how the question should be answered. Students also do a lot of presentations with group members for college researches. AVID's main goal for students is to frequently ask questions that they might be confused about. As I mentioned earlier, students being able to work in groups really allows them grow in being able to take a role in their work. Their leadership skills would also be developed giving them responsibility.

A school's teaching ability would improve a student's life by them learning how to build their skills and how would students apply them to their everyday lives.

Schools provide different learning experiences students may benefit from. It is known that each teacher has their own way of teaching their class. Some students may not like the way certain teachers teach but those are usually the ones that stand out the most. By having students struggle in a class they are improving their rigor. Taking rigorous classes would improve their learning skills which students could apply for other classes. Also, students could learn different learning methods from their teachers. Some teachers may have their own methods that may be easier and less time consuming. But, there are students that may have a hard time to be in that sort of situation. There are students that may face mental health issues that may be the reason why they are considering being home schooled. Students may not be able to handle a classroom environment, which is a good reason for them to have their course be taken at home. It would benefit students being able to learn in a comfortable environment for them.

In conclusion, allowing students to attend a school environment would benefit their lives in many ways. Schools do provide students an environment where they could benefit in the future is the school's main goal. Students are able to experience many different events that could change their lives for the better. Schools do provide the platform for students to be able to live a successful life. Schools are meant to lead future generations to become far greater than the previous so why change that now? ",5,Distance learning,Independent
82F7210163B5,"When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.

For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.

Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.

Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.

Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.

Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.         ",4,Distance learning,Independent
AAEED47072D9,"I believe students would not benefit from attending classes from home. Students need to be with a teacher when they need help, they should not have to set up a video conference just to receive help. Also, having other students in the classroom to help with work and projects is a plus of going to school everyday. Students should not attend classes at home since there isn't a true benefit in doing so.

Students need to be with a teacher when they need help, they shouldn't have to set up a video conference. Most students need a teacher at all times during a class period so they can explain in depth the topics that are being discussed. Having a teacher explain right in front of you is easier for myself and many other students. For example, if a student needed help outside of their scheduled class time, how would they reach the teacher without disrupting their other classes that they are teaching? There wouldn't be a possible way for a student to get a hold of their teacher without causing any disruptions.

Having other students in front of you that would help with work and projects is also a plus of going to school everyday. Getting a students perspective on different assignments and projects could actually save your grade. Sometimes you just need a little encouragement from your peers to get you through your assignments. Let's say a teacher assigned a project due the same night and allowed you to work with a partner to help get it done. How would you easily be able to communicate with your partner enough to get all of the work done before the due date? It would be really hard to do so over the phone or through a video conference. All in all, having someone to communicate with and help you with different assignments and projects is the difference between your grade.

Overall, there is not a benefit for students that attend classes at home or through a video conference. The students would not have a teacher that would be available to help them throughout the day or students to help with assignments and relate to them. Although others would believe that having students taking classes is a great idea and that they would benefit from the classes since they would be easier to complete at home, they are incorrect. Students need a challenge sometimes, so why would we have them work from home just because it is an easier option for them? We need to stop holding these children back since we know they can do better. We should not always jump to take the easy way out.",4,Distance learning,Independent
363F69979EAB,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home of way of online or video conferencing. There's an ongoing debate over if students should or should not attend classes from home. There are those who argue that students should attend classes from home, but they are wrong. Although some may disagree, students should not attend classes from home.

There are a variety of reasons why students should not permitted to attend classes from home. As a student in high school I understand that it is hard to make friends, so by going to school with other students I, like other students, have been developing these social skills that will be needed in the future. Throughout my years schooling there are multiple events that the students will have to show these set of skills: presentations, speeches, projects, all things that will never be experienced from at home schooling. With social skills there are people, and interacting with them can be joyful, when having a good time. Students at my school enjoy spending time with each other during sport practice especially. Practice for sports or electives are entertaining because you get time to do something that interest you and some time to relax from a stressful day at school. When apart of a team, band, or choir there are games and performances that are not able to be taken part of when home schooled.

There are additional reasons why students should not attend classes from home. All students have a different learning tactic, for myself it is through music. Not all student can be home schooled because they are not able to learn through a computer and fully understand the lesson being taught. When this occurs the student is expects to contact a teacher which is not always possible. When I am in need of help with a lesson in my classroom I can simply walk up to my teacher and get clarification on the lesson; however, when you are home schooled it is not that easy to where you can do that.

Even though some may disagree, students should not be allowed to take classes from home. Students should be prohibited from taking classes at home because they can not develop social skills, may not be able to get the extra help needed, can not experience taking electives and being in programs. There are those who argue that students should be able to take class from home, but this is not true. Ultimately, students should be able to experience school with other students and make memories that will be cherished.",4,Distance learning,Independent
BE0B394B4E9B,"For as long as they could remember, students have been attending school by following a structural path of their personal education. They take classes that teach them basic principles that they will contribute to their every day lives, as well as the future. As the world progresses in advancement, technology has played a vital role in expanding the education system. Some schools now offer an option for students to attend classes from their own home by online or video conferencing. This innovative and modern policy has been heavily debated upon if it is the right move for students to further their educational career. Although some may argue that distance learning may increase laziness for students, having them able to attend classes from home would overall benefit students by creating a comfortable environment, improving learning styles and creativity, as well as preparing them for college and future jobs.

Students spend a majority of their day at school and become aware of their certain surroundings. They understand their school dynamic and environment, which contributes a vital role in their education. If a student is uncomfortable with the environment that is represented throughout the school, it will make them dread coming to school and unmotivated to learn. Students spend around seven hours of their day at school, and if they are in an hostile habitat, it will negatively impact their education. By forcing students to stay in a place where they do not feel comfortable, it will deprive them of the knowledge and experience they could be receiving. Having students work from home would allow them to create their own safe space that they will learn better in. They would be in a comfortable environment that they themselves are used to, and can prosper in. Online classes would benefit students by giving them the choice to leave an environment where they feel limited, for a place that they know would allow them to learn effectively.

Every student is different, and they all know what methods they personally learn best from. Teachers at school often disregard this, and they go on to teach all of their students the same way. They have no choice but to implement this, due of the vast amount of students they have and the deadlines of curriculum. This way of educating limits the potential of students, as they are constricted to one way of learning. By giving students the opportunity to take online courses, they would be able to practice the learning style they know is best fitted for them. This will overall lead to better retention and understanding of the work that is being asked of them. Students know themselves, and they know what works for them in regards to learning certain materials. This freedom of education will also promote creativity and allow them to come up with new ways and projects for themselves. By allowing students to take these online courses, they would be able to learn effectively and broaden their horizons of ideas.

Students go to school to learn ideals that they will one day use in the future for their own well being. Everything that is taught to them is meant to build their knowledge and invent new ways of innovation for themselves, as well as society. By having students attend their classes from home, it will prepare them for the college and work experience that is set out for them. In college, students work on assignments on their own digital devices and submit them to their professors online. This is how they learn and build off of their knowledge, a concept that could be taught at an earlier age through the developments of online classes. In addition, with the speed at which technology is developing, most jobs will ask their employees to have technological knowledge and skills. This will put students at a greater chance of obtaining these jobs with the online experience they have. By having students take up on distance learning, they will become better equipped for the future that is ahead of them.

Many may argue that online classes will make students more lazy and likely to procrastinate their work. Though in hindsight, these online courses will further teach students how to schedule their time and effort on their assigned projects. These students know what will happen if they procrastinate their assignments, and through this they are better prepared to finish their work with the resources available to them. Online classes will even give students the opportunity to get ahead of their work, since they are not following the same schedule the courses taught at the school go.

A student's education is very important, and it is emphasized on being a fundamental building block of their own life. By implementing the choice of online classes, students would be able to take themselves out of hostile environment for somewhere they know they could learn in. They would be able to explore different learning styles that they know are best suited for them, which goes to spark creativity in the work they put out. Online courses would also give students the opportunity to jump start on their future and build habits that will benefit them for college and the work force. By having schools offer distance learning, their students would be able to prosper in ways that will benefit them for the rest of their educational career.",6,Distance learning,Independent
548EC5B339E3,"When we talk about technology and ways to improve our life, What is the first think that come to our minds: Cell phones, computers, internet etc. However technology is also present in the field of the medicine, food daily life etc. Now you think that technology is Just cell phones computers and internet.

I'am pretty sure that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because you're attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like.

Student would get benefits in many ways. If they study from home and if they also go to the normal school they can graduate much early than the usual. They can find a job too, if they organize their time wisely. If they have a job so they could earn money and they can use to pay college.

If some student ask me I obviously recommend them to take online classes, it is a good way to improve your weakness and also you are going to be more success.

My conclusion is yes student get benefits in many ways when they take classes from home. and I think that every school should have the option to choose if the students wants to take online classes, and also is a good idea to help the student to be more success in the life.

6E5F280580C4,"Should some school offer distance learning for students to attendend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.

One reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. It's for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work.

The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.

Some people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

In conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
6DADC0DF0C87,"I believe all students should have the option to enroll in distance learning. In my case, I prefer distance learning because I have trouble focusing in a classroom environment. Another plus of distance learning is you get to learn at your own pace and never have to stop for other students. Although distance learning isn't for everyone, I think all schools should offer it because it will be beneficial for many students.

Last year I did a full online school program, and this year I go into school every day but still use a online based system. Since starting distance learning my grades have improved drastically. In public school I always got F's and C's in my classes, I could barely focus and didn't want to stop the whole class when I didn't understand a concept. I never wanted to stay after school to get help from the teacher because that would take extra time out of my day. Once I started computer schooling I could instantly focus better and take brakes when I needed to reset my brain. Being able to work at my own pace is another thing I love about distance learning. I have been able to work a lot faster and complete my classes sooner and with better grades. One main reason I switched to distance learning was to make more time for other things such as my job, and relieving stress I had about school.

I think everybody should be offered distance learning as an option because other students may be struggling as I was in public schooling. However, distance learning is not for everyone. Distance learning can take discipline because you don't have a teacher to bug you when you are not getting your work done. Other students may have the discipline it takes, but prefer a teacher to learn from rather than reading or watching a video online. I think online schooling can help relieve the stress many students face in public schooling. I know first hand that getting the homework turned in, doing poorly on a test, or not getting time to do things you enjoy can be very stressful. Some students may also struggle with social issues such as bullying, where distance learning can help them get away from a toxic environment.

In conclusion, I believe all students should have the option to enroll in distance learning. Distance learning may not be right for some people, but I think it would benefit a large amount of students. Many teens struggle with the stress coming from the social and educational aspects of school, I believe distance learning can relieve this stress. Distance learning can free up time in your day so you have more time for things you enjoy doing. ",4,Distance learning,Independent

FF678908A963,"How would a student feel if they were able to attend classes from home? Happy? Or sad? In the 21st Century, people around the world are surrounded by possibilities, like online school, which could advance themselves as human beings. Attending online school will increase the level of security for students and staff, it will advance a students' studies, and will create an outlet for students to better express themselves.

When people oppose this idea of having online school, they tend to argue the fact that, students attending these classes from home will be socially undeveloped. Though this is a possibility among the few, opposers of this idea have to look at the great benefits to having schools of this domain available: a child will not experience physical bullying; students are able to learn more material by asking questions in an environment they know is safe; staff and students will be able to learn and grade at a pace that is best to meet their deadline for assignments.

Having to attend classes from home will greatly benefit both parties of students and staff. Over the past years, there have been multiple school shootings that happen randomly. Whether these shootings have to deal with personal or academic problems, schools can never ensure that a student nor a teacher will be safe at all times. To better make sense of things, being able to attend school from home could mean that a student will have a lower fatality rate because of the higher level of security they have at their home. Being a student who takes a virtual course, having the opportunity to learn at home means that I can keep my guard down and not have to worry about school shooters of any kind.

To further add on to the benefits, being able to attend classes from home could mean that a student can advance in their studies. Since a student is not on a strict schedule, they can set themselves up for success by establishing their own. When teaching with a physical class, teachers are inhibiting a students' success by holding up the class to answer questions instead of continuing with the planned lesson. Having the flexibility to speed up and slow down in a course could mean a great deal to the success of a students' future.

Similarly to advancing in their studies, students will also be able to foster an outlet where they will be better at expressing their emotions and social skills. Surrounded by their family members and neighbors, a student can better prepare themselves for the real world by applying new skills they learn by attending classes from home. For example, if a student were to take a Public Speaking course online from home, they will be better adapted to their environment, and will be able to perform at their best because they acknowledge the encouragement their family members and neighbors give to them.

Life grants people of all backgrounds the possibility to grow. People of the contemporary world should not be afraid of modernity or advancement for their children. There is only one life to live, and it is best to revel in it, which is justifies the notion that students would in fact benefit from being able to attend classes from home.",4,Distance learning,Independent
0A5299390319,"Learning helps you understand better, and it's the way of life. Everybody goes to school and learn, but other peoples stay home and learn. Students that made the decision to stay home and learn is doing what's best for them; especially if they are not comfortable going to school. In my belief learning from home does benefit because students can graduate faster, sick children are still able to learn, and students would be successful in future life.

Many students that are going to school are tired. I am a student that has been going to school for many of years; I am pretty much tired and exhausted! That is why I am taking online classes to finish my classes. Taking online classes helps a lot, mostly if students wants to finish school and get it over with. I am not going to lie school is so stressful. Finishing all the classes that we need and have enough credits, that is a mission accomplished. It makes us feel good and have that motivation to keep going forward with school, and by then we would reach our goals.

We have graduated early and it our decision on what we want to do with our life, some people may want to go to early college, or some people choose to chase their dream. Whatever keep us motivated we will keep going. That keeps us happy because we do things that want us to be motivated, and only way to get it over with is, taking online classes to graduate early.

It aches to hear people doubting other people just because they are sick. Sick people can still learn. Its not like they are some one else. For example, as a child I love to learn, it made me feel good about myself, but I was sick. And everyone thinks that because I was sick I won't be able to learn anything, I was left behind. It made me feel upset that I won't be able to learn like other children. It had me feeling down, so I told my mom I want to learn, I want to keep going to school. I had that motivation as a child that learning keeps me happy and understand the world I'm in. It helps me learn new things everyday. It made me feel so good about myself! I started home bounds; it is a program that students can still able to learn in any condition. I would video call my teachers every week days and learn. It made me feels so good, and look at where I am! I am happy where I have came, school can be stressful. But it helps me feel happy and focus on that task, expect of worrying about things that would upsets me. Video conferencing benefited me and it helps me where I am at today.

A way of being successful in life is to learn. A student that is passionate to finish school early and go on to chase their career is successful in life. Anyone can do what they want in life if they put effort to it. Taking online classes helps a lot, it benefit students. It keeps them happy on what they have chosen to do with their own life. Finish the classes and graduate early, see the real world behind them. Look what they want in life. Students want to see who they are,they want to chose who they want to be. Its their decision on what they want to be. For example, I remember reading a book about chasing dreams, a dream can't be chased if you haven't finish the important things in life, like school. Taking online classes would helps a lot. Do it and finish everything, and get it out of the way. Once we did the important things, chase the dream we want. It would be easier in life to get important things out of the way. And we don't have to worry about anything and just follow whatever that we wants to be.

In conclusion, attending classes from home by taking online classes, or video conferencing does benefits students. It helps students to graduate faster, it keeps sick student to still learn, and students to be successful in life on who they want to be. Without having a choice of taking online classes or video conferencing, students would not have any choices of how to get their education, it would be a whole mess.            ",4,Distance learning,Independent
32D3B300954A,"Schools are now starting to provide new methods of students being able to learn. With having school at home there is many benefits and cons about it. Students now have more ways to go to school and get a education that maybe they weren't able to get before. I think that students wouldn't really benefit from taking classes from home because they are more distractions, the student would probably will be on their phone, and the lack of communication with others.

Distractions become more noticeable at home because there are loads of things that could distract you. For example, if your taking your classes in the living room, the TV might be on or you're attempted to go watch TV. Another example, could be that your in the kitchen and you happen to start eating and you happen to take a break from your class. I honesty think that if you take classes from home it's a waste of time.

These almost everyone has a phone and even now at schools everyone is on them. I think that the with being home and having classes the phone will be like one of the main problem because of how addicting it is. For example during a session you get a call or text and your mind gets preoccupied with that text or call that you receive. It also takes away time from learning because if your constantly on the phone you aren't paying attention to whats happening.

Another reason that I think that we don't really benefit is that theres a lack of communication with other people. Having good communication skills is important to have because you might need it for a future job. With taking online or video conferences it sort of helps with that but not fully. It's more beneficial that they go to a public or private school because they are different types of people and you get more experience on the communication. For example, with doing a video conference most likely you'll be talking to the same teacher every day, while going to school somewhere you won't talk to the same one or couple of people.

With all being said, students should attend school instead of taking classes at home because of all the distractions, phones being in the way, and of lack of communication. Even though I might think a certain way, you shouldn't just take all my advice, many people happen to learn or educate themselves in different ways. I would like to thank whomever is reading this and thank them for the effort they put into reading this. By the way never stop learning in the long run it helps out a lot.      ",4,Distance learning,Independent

First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body can't make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he can't do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school.

Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you don't have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you can't find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesn't have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor.

Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class. Some teachers go to students home for the teaching just for one student and focuse to just one student. For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me.

Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses.

Some students, need go school for the understand better. Some students need go school because if they are stay in home and they want home schools maybe in not listen to teacher or make copy. For friendly some people is unsocial and need make friend in school. Ithink school good option for this studnets.",2,Distance learning,Independent
6DF747F4A277,"Some schools offer students to attend classes from home by being online. Therefore, students would be able to still learn while at home. Some people think that this offer does not benefit students. However, I think that this helps the students for many reasons. This offer can help with sick days, students who don't like to attend school, and less makeup work for students.

Students miss work and new lessons while at home sick. They can be out of school for a long period of time depending on their type of illness. Taking classes online or video conferencing can help them keep up with their work while out sick. If some schools do not have classes online for sick students they will most likely fail their classes if not caught up. This can benefit students while being sick at home.

Some students don't like to leave their house to attend school every week. They think it is a waste of time to wake up every morning to go to school. Online classes can help students with their hate towards going to school. To some students, going to school is tiring and stressful to do in the mornings. With online classes they can wake up at anytime to do their lessons with enough rest.

There can be students dealing with different situations at home. It can be anything in their life that causes them to not attend school on a regular basis. Addictionally, they would have a lot of makeup work to do for missing days. So therefore, if students don't have online classes they will have loads of makeup work to do. Makeup work can be stressful to do when the work is hard to understand.

All schools should provide an option to do online classes. Some people say this isn't a good option for students because they might not do their work. But it would be better because they get to choose what is best for them. This way everyone can be satisfied with doing their work.",3,Distance learning,Independent
47CC7361B35B,"Technology is pretty much at teenagers fingertips at all times. When it comes to the latest Tiktok trends,YouTube videos, Google, Instagram and all things in between students are influenced by the internet. Why not use something that most kids in Americans have access to in order to help educate Generation Z and the generations that follow. School is a very important aspect of life that all students should be able to enjoy. For many student school is not. School has become a drain on students mental health. Many kids rather learn more about their future carers,or become an influncers and athletes. The compromise is online school, why not just focus on what students need to know to be productive in life and still give them the opportunity presume different opportunities. Online schooling allows students to wake up later, get an education and are able to be happy and focus on other things. While many say online school is the easy way out in reality it teaches time management and responsibility in order to live out their dreams and helps out kids who miss school on a regular.

Online schooling is a way students can stay on top of their work and not fall behind there classmates. I had a friend freshman year who missed two months of school due to family issues in her home country. Missing that much school required her to stay back another year and retake classes should would have done well in had she not have had a family emergency. Having access to online school she would have been able to follow along with her classmates and still be their for her family. Taking

AP classes is a lot of work and requires you to be there every class. I can not tell you how many times I have come to school with really bad sicknesses so I do not miss notes,quizzes or a test in one those classes. For example I take AP bio every morning, if I miss one class I have missed half a chapter of notes. Which in the long run is a lot of information I now have to learn on my own. Having access to online school I am able to video chat into my classes, take my notes and make up any worksheets I am missing and still have a teacher explain it to me so I can have the full picture and still be able to rest up. While students need a breaks for school sometimes and online school has the possibility of taking that away, online school would be for student who miss 3 or more day and in the long run falling behind and and having a pile of work to come back to hurts so much more than not having a break.

Online school teaches students how to plan around their busy lives and still get their degree. The most common argument for online school is, ""Students will get behind and fail out."" This is true but goes the same way as regular school. If a student misses more than 10 days of school in a row the parents are put on trail for truancy and can be taken to jail. The same should apply to student who choose to learn online. Online school will help keep students on top of their game and still allow them to do the things they enjoy. For students graduating early this helps them do everything required and go to college early. Having fun requires responsibility. Students know if they are not doing well they will have to go back to public school which would be embarrassing for them.

Follow your dreams is a statement many teachers have taught students since kindergarten. How can one follow their dreams when they are required to stay in school for 180 days of the year. This is where online school takes a huge part in. Students are still able to walk across the stage at graduating and do something they are passionate about. Charlie Damelio,and other influncers miss a lot of school due to tours, commercials and brand trips. Online school is their only option. Many people say that kids should not miss school for entertainment purposes, but these kids are building a brand and making money in a capitalistic society. Pulling kids out of school to work on TV shows and movies is not a new concept. How do you think shows like Full House and Boy Meets World were filmed. These kids had to hire teachers to teach them full time and still go to set. Online Schooling is so much better for actors and influncers now because they can do all the requirements their school has and still film. Noah Schnapp, an actor on Stranger Things loves online school because when he is done filming he can go back to school and is not behind. Online school is something that has been brought up in my family recently. My sister does gymnastics and practices 4 hours a day 3 days a week, Her coaches believe she could become a junior Olympian and wants her to practice 5 days a week for 8 hours a day. Thats a huge opportunity for a 13 year old and could help her get into UCLA on a full gymnastics scholarship. Her passion and drive for gymnastics is not at the same level as it is for school. She goes to school and just does what she need to do to pass. Online school is a really good option for her so she is able to do what she loves and get an education.

Another positive of online school is that students are able to work full time and get a degree. Many students must work a 5 hour job and go to school for 8 hours to support their family.

Having the option of school online lets them plan classes around working and still allow them to walk across the stage. Online school is a great substitute for kids who are looking toward becoming famous and making a living at a young age.

Online school allows students to do what they love, not get behind and learn responsibility. This is an amazing tool if used correctly to help student who get sick a lot, who are trying to get famous or trying to start with their careers. With great power comes great responsibility that student are able to learn with this process. Having the option of online school helps improve the way of education for all.          ",6,Distance learning,Independent
83AE9B85F6FD,"The Benefits of Online Schooling

From lack of transportation, disabilities or feeling unsafe, many students are forced to stay home and miss out on valuable learning opportunities. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it revokes the need for transportation routes, allows students with injuries or disabilities to participate and allows students to feel safe while learning.

Many areas and school districts are fortunate enough to provide school parking and bus routes for their students. However, many times students need to make an extraneous effort simply to get transportation to school. Many students in my school district need to be driven to their nearest bus stop to even be able to ride for an hour to attend their local high school. Inclement weather or lack of a ride forces many of my school mates to miss class. These absences can be counteracted with the introduction of online classes. Students will benefit from online courses and curriculum without having to worry about having their transportation needs met. Students will be able to participate in an online classroom and engage with others without having to step out of their own home. Weather or lack of a ride forces many bright students to miss out on critical learning opportunities because of circumstantial needs. These aforementioned situations are common around the country and the introduction of online classes will alleviate these unfortunate absences.

Many schools outside of the country don't provide transportation services similar to the US. Students in Germany take the metro to get to school and many other students are forced to ride trains or local buses to their high schools. This may cause many students to feel unsafe and administer a feeling of fear with going to school. In many cases, girls feel unsafe to ride local buses and trains alone due to fear of sexual assault or kidnap. Rape and sexual assault are horrid things to think about but are often times reality for many females (and males) on public transportation. Online schooling offers a way for students to take classes online without having to worry about these issues. It gives students a chance to learn without worrying about their safety and the safety of others.

Teenagers with disabilities or critical injuries will benefit from online schooling because it gives them a chance to participate in an everyday classroom setting without worrying about commute in between classes and bullying from others. I am so thankful that I am fortunate enough to attend such an inclusive and disability friendly school, however, it is important to recognize that not all schools are like this. Bullying is a major issue within the public school system and many times students with disabilities become easy targets. These students are deserving of the same educational opportunities as everybody else and online classes offer that platform. Adding on, online classes revoke the need for commute between classes. There are times in which students in wheelchairs have trouble getting to class due to the overcrowded hallways and bustling of students. Schools with two to more stories also pose a problem of commute if the elevator breaks. These cases are solved with online schooling because students will no longer have to face these issues. Online classes will benefit teenagers with disabilities because they alleviate the potential threat of bullying and the need for commute between classes.

Online schooling is a powerful and new technological advance that needs to be addressed. It will aid students with transportation needs, revoke unsafe feelings and aid students with disabilities. Others may argue that although being able to attend online classes provides a platform that solves transportation needs, it poses the threat of students falling behind due to lack of a physical teacher. Although this is a reasonable concern, there is no need to worry. Students will be able to work with teachers online and there will still be teacher guidance within these classes. Online classes still have a grade book and many times, these classes offer live calls/chats with the teachers. Students will be able to work on their own time and still maintain grades. Online schooling is a benefit to students everywhere. It grants students unimaginable opportunities because it helps those with tranportation needs, aids with providing a feeling of safety and improves conditions for students with disabilities. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
5F1ED0796466,"In an ever-transforming capitalist society, we still find ourselves longing to achieve the ""American Dream"", a dated concept that we are all competing amongst ourselves towards the desired outcome of eternal ""happiness"" ""prosperity"". Though these ideas are loosely defined, it is evident that this ideal is still widely present within our society; which explains partially why we strenuously embark on our own educational journeys despite having little interest in the information we are being presented. Some students prefer to make amends in their journey towards their

American Dream, opting for a ""distance education"" which allows students to learn via online instruction or video conferencing.

Although distance learning is sometimes regarded as a preferred alternative for many students who may struggle in a traditional K-12 setting, this form of education is restrictive in the sense that it has the potential to be diminishing towards the necessary social development needed for students to succeed in society.

While receiving an online education may offer a more comfortable environment for many students, even offering a nuanced opportunity towards the development of valuable time management skills, typical in-school education provides critical social benefits that an isolated, online-based school environment would struggle to provide. An example of this can be observed on a daily basis: with the simple accessibility of smart phones, it is now engraved in our culture that using technology to opt out of social situations is acceptable and more commonplace than ever before. This is because our long-term un-moderated exposure to technology and its tendency to distract us from meaningful relationships with the people around us, is used as an excuse to limit our own social development. As a technologically-dependent and ever-evolving 21st century society, it would be unrealistic to propose that we halt the development of new technology as a means to preserve basic human interaction. Because these social habits are nearly irreversible on a global scale, an isolated, 100% digitized school environment would only promote the social debilitation of today's adolescent student body.

An in-school education strives to mimic the workplace environment. An example of this is the push for ""hands-on"" learning in the classroom as a response to criticism about lecture and textbook-style education for a more realistic alternative. Hands-on learning has been notably successful across the K-12 community in ensuring that students are not only consuming the information they are receiving, but also applying them in practical situations. This is especially common in CTE courses, where students have the opportunity to operate machinery and complete manual work to prepare them for the demands of that corresponding career pathway. Online schooling, in contrast to a standard public education, fails to fulfill the psychological and tangible necessity for students to fully engage with their learning. Learning through a screen only addresses the consumption of material, while in-school education promotes the routine of a workplace, where employees are not only technologically skilled, but are required to perform manual work as well.

In-school education is necessary for all students in order to provide an effective education system that encourages the fair success of our future in a competitive capitalist society. On both a societal and individual level, an in-school education would entail lifelong social, personal, and monetary benefits that an online education would simply fail to provide long-term. Furthermore, proper socialization beyond core content is a necessity in education.",6,Distance learning,Independent
AEE03367AC03,"Being able to attend a class from home is a poor idea created by schools for students that cant attend school.

Recently schools have created online classes for students who cant attend or when the school is closed. Although some say that a student being able to attend a class from home can benefit their mental stability or there transit.

Attending a class from home promotes being lazy, allows more distractions and can take the drive out of a student.

Some other reasons would be. Not having to attend classes makes the student lazy. The students no longer have to rush to class, or wake up early. Theyre almost encouraged to become more lenient with the work. Also the classes can be completed at any given time allowing severe procrastination to kick in. Taking these online classes you begin to lose the school social life by not actually attending. A key part of any school is the meeting of friends and peers along the way but staying home all the time, you obtain little to no social in school life. knowing your teachers can bring along relationships that can help you out later in life such as a recommendation for a job. Attending from home offers more distractions. some would argue that school is the more distracting place for a student but at home your own freedom can get the best of you and lead you away from your work without someone pulling you back in.

There is a variety of reason why. Being away can free a students mind even with the stress of school.

Allowing a student to be away from their regular home lifestyle can benefit their mood as well as showing them something new in life to keep there mind creative. staying at home offers little life experiences that any kids deserves to experience. It takes away drive a student need to succeed . They no longer have to make a class a priority since they have all the time to complete it, and they begin to lose interest in trying to make sure they are doing the best they can to succeed. Taking an online class just doesnt involve you and keep you in the loop like a regular class will. It could leave you almost less knowledgeable then actually attending. You only retain the information that the online videos or prompts give you, you dont get to here the extra knowledge you could learn in a more interactive environment.

Attending a class from home can leave you lazy, finding more distractions, and it can take the drive out of you.

although some may disagree and say that online school can benefit ones stress levels and take care of housing and transit they are mistaken. Online school can and will be useful in desperate times, such as when theyre is a epidemic and schools need to close and students need to complete there classes somehow but on a note of simply not being able to attend school it can ruin the school life for someone and remove vital things it takes to be a successful adult.              ",5,Distance learning,Independent
C47F20E50D46,"Home schooling has crossed the mind of every student at least once or twice within the twelve years of mandatory school they have to endure. The opportunity to receive an education from the comfort and familiarity of home. Giving students the opportunity to be able to attend classes from home via online would be beneficial to students with physical and/or mental disabilities and would also decrease the truancy rate.

Having a disability in itself is already a burden for some, whether it be physical or mental. Some disabilities make it hard to do everyday things like: waking up on time, speaking in public spaces, being in big crowds, and even in some cases getting an education. Being able to receive schooling in the comfort of your own home, or anywhere for that matter, would help rid the worry of children not getting the schooling they so rightfully deserve. Additionally, online classes would also lower the amount of bulling certain children receive because of their disability. Some kids are very cruel because of unknown reasons, and people shouldn't have to go through that just because they want to learn.

Another problem online school can help is truancy. Being that the class is online there is no excuse not to be able to do the work. Students don't have to show up to a certain place at a specific time or have to wake up super early, as long as some type of internet connection is available. Even though, there will always be some bad apples in the bunch that choose not to take advantage of being able to essentially 'work from home'; that shouldn't talk away the chance for the people would actually put in the effort to do the work.

In conclusion, students should be able to choose whether they want to go to a public school or participate in home/online school, because with being able to pick everyone has a chance to have something that accommodates to their individual needs. ",4,Distance learning,Independent
4B47096239FB,"Attending school practically takes up our entire day, and our entire lives. By the time we get up, get ready, travel to school, attend class, then come home to do additional homework, or entire day is gone. Additionally, we also spend five of the seven days of the week attending class, and those other two days of the weekend are overwhelmed with more homework. What about those who live far away? If they were at home, they would actually be able to get more work done as their commute time is absent. Where is their time allotted to spend time with family when your whole life is centered around school? Lastly, what about those who have a mental illness, that disables them to attend school for a whole day? Students would benefit to a great extent if they could take classes online, at home, because it would cut out commute time, allowing them to work more, would permit more time to do other activities like spending time with family, and would also benefit those who have chronic mental illnesses as these individuals struggle to spend eight hours a day physically at school.

For those who live a great distance away from a school, online classes would benefit them to a great extent. The commute time takes up hours of there day, especially if they ride the bus. School is only eight hours a day, but including travel time, the act of going to school can take up ten or more hours of an individual's 24 hour time period. This permits them from being able to get all there homework done, and can also make them more tired since they must get up early to travel, and then stay up late since they get home much later. This results in an unfocused student, who hardly pays attention in class and additionally, a student who doesn't get as much work done. With online classes, the travel time is absent. This allows a student to learn and work more. The student would have more time in the day to spend quality time working. This would result in a more focused, determined individual.

When your entire day is centered around school- the traveling, class, and homework- students have little time to participate in activities they enjoy and spend time with family, which is crucial for mental stability. Teachers preach of having good grades, extracurriculars, and family time, but school is eliminating these options for the majority of students. With online courses, students can take their time working on school, but would also have time to spend with family and do extracurriculars. This would result in a balanced lifestyle; a lifestyle that isn't overwhelmed with work. The balanced lifestyle would reflect in the student's learning ability, as they would now be more calm and focused to do their work.

For those who have a disabling mental illness, online classes would benefit them greatly. When a student has depression, anxiety etc., they often find themselves unable to attend school for a full day, or even at all. Likewise, if they are present, they cannot focus and by the end of the school day, they are so mentally and physically exhausted that they cannot get their homework done. Their grades suffer as a result. With distance learning, they can work at their own pace, taking the necessary breaks when needed. The individuals would not be concerned with falling behind, because they would be able to do the work when they were mentally stable. Mental illnesses are just as serious as physical illnesses, and the act of physically going to school can be detrimental to their health, and to their grades. Online schooling would allow them to achieve a stable well-being, and a higher state of learning.

The act of physically going to school does not benefit everyone, therefore, online learning would be a beneficial option. Distance learning would still allow for those to achieve an education, but in a more peaceful environment. It would allow students to spend more time on their work since travel time is cut out, and would also permit those to have a balanced life as they spend time doing extracurriculars, being social, and spending time with family. It would greatly impact those with mental illnesses, as it would allow them to work when they are in a healthy mental state, and allow them to work at anytime. This would result in a higher level of knowledge, a more stable mental health, and better grades. Some may argue that school is necessary for social interactions. This argument can be rebutted, as those who choose online courses would actually have more time to be social. Overall, online courses, would drastically improve people's grades as they would be more focused and have more time. It would also permit them to be social and to have family time, resulting in a more balanced lifestyle that would provide better mental stability. Online courses would greatly impact students in a positive way. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
9145AB74E1DA,"I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. They're different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didn't feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.

There are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.

I'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. They're a lot of reasons is to why I don't think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.

My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. Yes their will be some kids that will learn online and there won't be some people do work better with the person right in front of them.",3,Distance learning,Independent
4E68CFD1B4D6,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe this is a good way to go around things for people that are disabled and cant walk or stand easily. Lets say you are disables and its hard for you to walk and your school has stairs but no elevator. Instead of going to school, you can work on your school work at home and not have to worry about having to go up and down the stairs, or bumping into people while you go by.

Being able to work on school while at home means you can have experience for when you have a job that you can work remotely for. For example lets say you want to become a proposal manager and you are sick and cant go to work, You will have some experience with working from home and not getting distracted while working because you did it with school work. You will have the proper ability to be able to work and not have to worry if you are going to turn it in on time.

Another example i'm going to explain is that you dont have to worry about not having enough time in class to work on a project or paper. When you are at home, you have a lot more time to work on one thing at a time and not have a time limit. So if you are scared that you will not have enough time to turn in the project while you are at school, if your doing the online course you can work on it for a bit, switch over to another class if you need a break, then work on it more. You are not able to do that if you are at school its one subject at a time.

One downside to working at home is that you dont get to see your friends as often or make new ones. Because if your at home and not at a public or private school you wont see new people as often as if you where going working at home. Making it difficult to make or see friends.

In conclusion if I had the option to work at home I would like to do it. Mostly because i suck at turning in things that are do while I have distractions at school from being with friends or people talking. So if there is an option to work on school at home I would take it.",4,Distance learning,Independent
1C32F25C46EE,"I will say that i desagree with the idea of having distance learning for our's studente to take classes from their home i suggest have doing it the same way as always and have that as a better option.

first reason why: because a lot's of teacher keep their work and keep doing it as they use to and that can that many teacher don have to lose their case there might a lot of them that prefer having a classroom full of student or some others just prefer that way is easier or they like to comunicate with the student and that is something that some times can benefit the student.

second reason student can learn how to be more socialise with others students and that can make them have better comunication with other people for example it would be a lot easier to get job by them self cause that make them feel sure about them self and that make the student better on almost all their classes.

Third reason is that shools can steel be use normaly as long everything is ok with them an the steel can have a porpuse for many reson for students. but some people said that having the student take those from home by way of online or video conferencing might let some student have a more flexeble schedule because at the fact they in their home but i said this might corrupt the student learnig there might tha have acces to wifi or dont transport you know having to go to a library so that's why apik this position about having to take classes online.",3,Distance learning,Independent
93B23DB0F67B,"Students taking classes from home is a advantage and disadvantage. Because most of the students don't pass the online class, its hard for students to understand, what the teacher is talking about when talking through a video call. But most of the parents cant afford to send their kids to school, so the kids gotta learn from home. Goin to school learn is the best way, so the teacher can explain them. The advantage is teachers stay after school for extra help for students. Most teachers come home, and teaches student. The parents can watch what their child is learning. So my paragragh is about disadvantage and advantage.

The students stay home and learn from their parents. If you live in a village in parts of Asia they have small school for students, they are free but their education isn't good. Parents don't have enough money to send their kids to school with good education. The small schools that are free doesn't offer that much education. Students just stay home and let parents teaches watever or how much they know. The schools that are free, the environment isnt good, the teachers arent that much educated.

The advantage is most of the teachers come home, and teaches students for free. Because they understand their parents cant afford. If students go to school and if they need extra help, teachers can stay after school. There are public schools in USA that offer free education. The students can learn a lot from school more than learning at home. In most part of the countries some good schools take a test what students know, if they pass the Government pays the expensive for the students. It is a very big advantage.

So taking classes online or going to school are both good. Beacuse education is very important, going to school is best way to get education. Because what the school teaches nobody can't. ",2,Distance learning,Independent
9FB9825462EE,"The subject of Schooling is a long, complicated and variable. From the debate on public versus private, homework, and the classes themselves, it is a truly mamothian subject. But amoung all of these differnt ideas, the subject of Long Distance Schooling (I.E Students learning from home via some sort of internet enabled device) is so often overlookd.

And i do belive that to be a true shame, for Long Distance Schooling (Hentsforth to be referred to as LDS) is a brilliant tool that should be used everywere! lets show its perks by means of an example. You live near a large metropolitan area, not unlike Generic_City or Generic_City. your daily commute to school can take you as long as 2 hours each way! this means you have to wake up early to get to school, and will have to stay up later to get all your work done. it could quite easily cause you to fall behind in sleep and school. But, through th magic of LDS, you now have 4 extra hours of your day you can work with.

this could be used in a variety of different ways. You could se it for extra sleep, which would probably allow you to perform better in class. or you could spend that extra time you now have pursing post High School opportunitys, such as collge, trade school, or a job. Alredy from time saved, your qaulity of life has been ffr and away bettered by a switch to LDS.

""but hold on"" some of you may be thinking, ""what if i dont live in a city or far away from my school?"". Than your simply not thinking about some of the more commonly applicable elements of such a system. for instance, how often has a student gotten sick and then proceeded to fall behind on classwok? Im sure the qauntity is staggering, but no longer! A student, even if they are sickly and bed ridden, can still participate in classroom activitys by observing and following along with the rest of his or her class.

And even throughing both of this vary well postulated examples to the metephorical wind, you can still find many reasons as to why such a system is benfical. Maybe a student is shy and would perfer a more, disconected aproach?

Perhaps a child cannot attend class due to a long family vacation? One thousand examples could be found in an instant as to why such a system is more than worth the investment by our school systems.

I do hope you find my argument to be valid and well written, as it is my intention to help students the world over by giving them all the tools they need for success.

If the students has that kind of benefit they cant growth higher, and they can have good result. some school makeb online learning ans they have video conferencing because some students have job they can't came to school full time of school and they make that benefit to all students be able to attend classes in home .

if studens be sovereign about their self at the end they can fiend high ranking in thair life. every person should learning because if we dont learn we can't fiend our goal's, and also if we don't study we can't have a good life in the future. we have alot of benefit's from home (family, parent) and school, we shuold use it and ask question and make ouer self smart and to be laborer person.

Other people say that the offer distance leaning as not an option for students to attend classes from home because students can learn better in school, they sould came to school and study hard and do their their work. and to be a nice person, heplful ,and hard worker to have a gread job and gread live in the future.                                                                                                      ",3,Distance learning,Independent
931D5E447FA7,"It's good idea to receive distance learning? Well some school offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home. This learning way could have many benefit for student that need distance learning. Also distance learning help student get involved in school, because occasionally the school is giving chance and the opportunity to student to learning. By that way there is not excuse to not learnig or not go to school, you can get your diploma ease.

Distance learning give the option for estudent to get their credit to graduate, particularly for student that are in high grade but they don't have enough credit to graduate. In this case the school give them the option to take distance learning. This is a great opportunity for student that need graduate soon. One example of this is Woodbridge senior high school. Woodbridge senior high school is giving the opportunity to student who need graduate this year, but they don't have enough credit to graduate. Then student are taking distance learnig. Some people must be asking theirself how this is possible, well there are two main way; online or video conferencing. By the way online and video conferencing the student must be have internet access at home. Maybe this can affect the student that dosen't have internet access at home, for those case the school have another options for them.

This two main way are support it by the school, then student dosen't need to pay any charge for their learning. Distance learning can help student finantially because they are taking classes at their, house that means they don't need to go out and spend their money in food or trasnportation.

In conclution distance learning is a very good idea to help student get their credit to graduate as soon is possible and it have many benefit: Finantially, learning, and facility. This way estudent can get their learning and all that they need to get their diploma.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ",3,Distance learning,Independent
36246752B6F8,"Home school is starting to become more popular thanks to computers. Now with online classes students can take online school instead of coming to a school classroom. But is it the best choice for students be allowed to take school online. Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home because they can pick their own time when they start, have more choices of classes and can still learn during crises.

Picking what time to start school would be a benefit of why students should be able to attend classes from home. For some students it could be hard to wake up at six in the morning to go to school because, of that some teen fail classes. It could be because, they were working all night to help their family with their money problem. With online school student could now start school at ten in morning and have a job later in the day so that they still get job exertions and help their family. It will also get rid of the problem of not being able to go to the bathroom and being hungry during class. Now they could just get go get a snack or use the bathroom. Some may agree, that Student will juts waste their time doing something else. However, with online school parent would be able to check when their kid log in in and for long and also what they have done.

Having more classes to choose form would benefit students taking classes form home. Student would able to pick form more classes online then in school. For example, a kid want to learn about how to build a car or robot., now they can pick more classes based on what they what to do later in life. Schools can not have every avablie classes because of space, but with online now they could take classes that would help them in the future. Also, most adults do not thing that things they learned school were helpful like for example why do we need to learn about pie in math. It would better if there was more classes to choose form help them out in college. Some may agree, that student would take all the easiest class to finish online fast. However, some student may need to take easier classes. One reason could be that they have a learning disable so it is harder for them to learn. also could that they want to not go to college or just want to go to trade school ,so do not need all the harder classes.

Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home because they can still learn during crises.

With the Coronavirus out there right now school are scambing to find away or student to still learn while not spreading the virus. The humans who where already learn for home do not have to worry about nothing and it is also harder for them to get the virus. With diseases and viruses school are one of the fastest ways to spread them. will it take is one kid to have the disease to it around spread the whole school and then everyone gets it. With online school it would be harder for kids to get the disease. Some may agree, that there other ways to spread disease too. However, there are other ways to spread them, but schools are the biggest way. With schools gone it would take way longer for disease like the Coranavirus to spread around the world.

With being able to pick our own time when they start, have more choices of classes and can still learn during crises are reason why Students would benefit form being able to attend classes form home. If we do not act now another virus could pop up and stop student form learning. Also with a limited of choices of classes more and more people will just think school is useless. This is why we should just move on to home school.                                    ",4,Distance learning,Independent
2089EF1099EB,"I think that the schools have good idea for the students for them is better because study more in at home, and also is interesting that each student have time for study in home the reasons is because this can to be benefit for the student. I think for some student is more easy take the class for online, but also if the schools have the opportunity about how the student can study in their home. Also because some student don't like coming in schools and for they is easy study in home, maybe they have more time for make homework, and for me is very important because the student is learning more. But there are many student that need study more in the school or home because the study for them is most important in the life . The student need more study , they have more time, and also is important for the future.

When the students have more time for study is more easy for they each day .

for example I'm study in my home I take one class for online and this is more easy study in my home because I have my time,but always and focus in the class is important that the student take class in our home for the future this we help enough for to be good student.

The first reason is about how the student need more study.

The student can study in home because the school have many benefit for them. However we need study more in home or school. the reason is because when study more the homework or test is more easy for us for this is important study, and never we can study for the others if not for our self many time some student they don't want study for they self, but in the life only there one thing is study hard we can stop. and many times be a student is not easy is very hard, this dependent from us which is the most important in the life study or make another think. because always the passion for study is have more time for our study now need more study the others student need study more because this is the more important and is more easy when we have more benefits for take the some class in home because nothing is difficult in the life study in home or school is the same thing, for example some teacher need that the student learn more because some student can not study in the school not pay attention and while we have a benefit for take some class in home we need to be able and responsible.

The second reason is about they have more time.

when the some student study in home have more time because they take time for make another thing, some time when we study in home we find a place alone for study with more concentration, also because the school we need have student with more good ideas y for this reason the student need take the attend classes in home because the school offer one option for each student. and the student need take more time for the study because is interesting take class in our home,many times the student have more time for another thing that for study, for example I'm student, but some times I think that the study is hard but the thing is that the study is the most important and is more better when we have a benefit from the schools, for this we need take more time for study in home is not hard take some classes in home because also we need to be a good person in the future. Today I need to say something I take one class in my home I have my time for make the another homework or something because don't matter how many classes we take in our home, and also we need to know the reason because we need take classes in home this is one opportunity more that when have like student, some student take more time and study because is the most important take more time is our study we need to study more we need to have more time for the good things for our self.

Is important for the future when we studying our home or school is more easy each day. The third reason is about is important in the future.

When we the students we have more benefit in the school is very interesting because this help our self because the school have the opportunity, how the students need have a good future and for this reason the schools offer how help each student. I think that is very interesting for the students because this is for that we have a good future in the life is important when we find a reason for our future but we can be good students when we study more, also because the schools need more students with interest in the school for make a good future because the school is the most important for each student and many time only some students have the opportunity of take the class in home, and this is important in the future when the student work hard each day for a better future,and also never wait that the others study for us because we are student is the most important is give every our effort. I think that this is important endeavor each day for our future better because not there anymore better in the life that the study, also having a good benefit from the school.

Inconclusion when the students have more time is more easy for they each day, and also they have time and their home, this is important for the future. However we need to study more in home or school, because this is important for us and many time we think that study in our home is hard but is interesting study more not only in the schools the student need take more time for study in home because is more easy when the school give one option for this reason the students need study more because is the best always when we are students good,and many time the students lose the opportunity that the school offer. Also we need more time for study because many times we have time for an others thing,but not for study,when the schools give the opportunity for be a good students in the life. And the most important is when the effort from today is the most important for the future because in the life only exist one opportunity,and for this reason we need to study more don't matter if is difficult because our future always is the most important.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent
B7A0347C68C3,"I know taking online or watching video conferencing class can be relaxing sometime, and sometimes student even pray for school to be close. but that does not mean student should take online classes or watch video conferencing , It not a good idea for student to be take online classes and I am not in favor of the idea for student to take online or watch video conferencing because they can find the online teaching to be boring and it will be very hard for student to understand the teaching of the video.

Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing.

firstly why I don't agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they can't focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student don't gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching.

secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing can't be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. like if the video is playing but the student don't understand the teaching of the video he or she can't get the chance to ask question about what they don't understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she don't understand they can ask question about the topic. other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they can't get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching.

I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they can't focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video.

for this way I find it very difficult for student to gained any learning from taking the online or the video conferencing class.       ",4,Distance learning,Independent
16D2B327B978,"Students may view school as an obligation, wishing that they could just stay home all day and relax. At first, the introduction of allowing students to learn through a computer screen in the comfort of their own home may seem like an excellent idea, however, after a while students may begin to feel lonely and as if they are not benefiting much from it. I think that students would not benefit from an at home learning system due to the fact that a face to face learning experience is much more efficient than one behind a screen.

There are lots of students that are home schooled, which does not allow them to have a real school like experience. For most of society, having the school experience taught them things, such as work ethic, time management, how to deal with people, and much more. If a student does online schooling through video calls and conferences, they are just like home schooled students, meaning they will not receive the benefit of having a school experience. For some, the school experience may not have been as pleasing as it was for others, but everyone has gone to a physical school got to make mistakes, learn from them, and apply it to their life later on. If a student goes to school through an online program, they will have not gotten to learn from the experience of being in a physical school, which could cause them incredible difficulties later on, such as the social aspect of life.

A big part of society is social interaction. It has been proved that humans need social interaction to live happily, and if they don't get that, it can have some very bad consequences. For some criminals, the government will put them into isolation as a form of punishment, meaning no interaction with other humans for a period of time. This is a form of punishment due to the fact that humans need the social aspect of life in order to mentally survive. Even though classes through video calls and conferences is nowhere near as bad as isolation is, they may not have many friends outside of their school unless it is because of a sports team or a community project they are involved in. Students who participate in public school are constantly interacting with their peers and teachers, asking questions, talking to friends in the hallways, and so much more. It is through school that so many students have formed close and solid friend groups, who go and hangout on a Friday or Saturday night. Those who do school online find it much harder to make close friends, and this is due to the fact that they are not around their peers all the time, which makes them have to put in a lot more work to find friends to hangout with. Those who are able to form close social bonds with people through school is a reason why students benefit much more by physically going to school rather than an online video call or conference.

Another reason as to why physically attending school is significantly more beneficial than doing classes online is because of the interactive and hands on experience students receive. In classrooms, students get the chance to learn through interaction by participating in labs, presentations, class discussions, and many other interactive experiences. Students can use presentations and class discussions to bounce ideas off of each other, and if a student has a question after a lesson, they do not have to email or call the teacher back, they can simply go up and ask to get the information they need right away. There are lots of students who state that they learn better through visuals and hands on experiences. Those who take classes at home do not have the opportunity to have a real hands on learning experience, which for some could alter how much material their brain actually grasps on to. Students would not be able to physically pick apart the subject they are learning, especially in science areas, which could lead them to not obtain as much information as they could have with an interactive experience.

Having a physical in class learning experience is much more beneficial than one over the internet due to the school experience students receive, the social interaction, and the hands on learning they get to experience. However, even though there is much evidence to backup why going to a classroom to learn is better, it can be stated that learning online through video calls is the way to go. If students have anxiety or are constantly stressed out, learning online may be a much more relaxing way to gain material. Since there is so much more reasoning as to why a physical learning system is so much better than an online one, all evidence gathered to support this overpowers any evidence to support doing classes online. Because of the evidence and reasoning presented, having a physical learning experience is incredibly more beneficial having a learning system online. ",6,Distance learning,Independent
E2630767E36B,"If we have access to the greatest technological innovations of human history, shouldn't we be using them to allow students to choose the way they want to learn? Schools have started to incorporate modern technology into the classroom, where schools are surrounded with screens instead of chalkboards and laptops instead of binders. Thus, as technology becomes easier to integrate with learning, many schools have started to give the option of learning through online software rather than sitting in a classroom. I believe that students would be able to benefit from learning through online or video conferencing, because they would be able to learn in a method that is more convenient, less stressful for students with social issues, and more helpful through the use of learning with online media.

Rather than having to sit in a classroom, online learning would allow students to learn in a way that makes them feel the most comfortable, increasing the convenience and ease of learning. The goal of school is to empower students to learn and gain knowledge that will ultimately help them later in life. Therefore, schools should assess what methods allow students to gain the most amount of knowledge in a given amount of time, thus increasing the efficiency of learning. Schools have tried various methods of increasing efficiency, such as making high school start at a later time or making the cafeteria food more healthy. However, these past changes fail in that they do not tailor the school experience based on one's need. Furthermore, if a student learns best at night time, they do not have the option to take their high school schedule at night. Or, if a student learns best on a couch instead a desk, they have to settle with sitting in a desk for most of their day. These examples show that the best way of increase learning efficiency is by giving choice to the students, and online learning gives much more choice compared to traditional school. Students are not tied to sitting in a classroom or learning at specific points in a day, allowing them to choose the way they learn the best. Thus, convenience and choice from distance learning allow students to gain more knowledge and be more successful later in their jobs. Some may argue that the convenience would lead to a lack of physical interactions at a school, isolating students from developing relationships with their peers. However, since distance learning gives students more choice, they can choose how and when they interact with their peers, allowing social relationships to be built on their own time rather than during school time.

Online learning would decrease stress for students who have social issues attending school. For example, some students with mental disabilities have issues being surrounded with hundreds of other students at school. Luckily, online learning can allow these students to receive their education without having to be around others, which makes learning a much easier process. In addition, I have noticed how social media has made many students develop anxiety over social interactions at schools. However, online learning can allow these students to be less focused on social dilemmas at the hallway and more focused on their studying during school time. Therefore, distance learning can be useful to combat the social problems that distract many students from learning at school.

Finally, online learning can make the learning process more engaging and useful to students through the use of online software. For example, I have taken a course online through a program called Virtual Loudoun, and I noticed how the curriculum involved the use of online slide show presentations, videos, and diagrams. This made my learning process much easier, since the various methods of learning kept me more and engaged and interested to learn. Although some classrooms have implemented presentations and videos, most still largely revolve around teachers lecturing to the class, which does not engage students nearly as well as other online methods. Some may argue that online learning does not allow for students to get specialized or individual help if they have issues. However, online learning still retains all of the traditional benefits that come from learning in a classroom. For example, if a students needs specialized assistance, they can easily setup a video conference to talk individually with their teacher. Also, online software can allow students to take quizzes, tests, and assignments at certain deadlines, and teachers can easily grade their work and upload their results to a grade book. Therefore, online learning has all the advantages of normal classroom learning, on top of increased engagement through the use of different learning methods.

Overall, distance learning with the use of technology is the future of learning as it allows students to choose where and when they learn, have less anxiety for those with social issues, receive a better education through the use of online media. All of these example will allow empower students to be more successful once they eventually enter the workforce. Traditional classrooms have been around for hundreds of years, and it's time that society evolves and transforms the way that students learn by using technological innovations.",6,Distance learning,Independent
AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you won't have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls aren't great because most people aren't paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you won't meet any people and you won't learn how to socialize at the end you won't learn how speak to people.

The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school.

To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you aren't at a on campus school,You're grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you don't go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. It's not fun staying home

With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day it's still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they aren't doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education that's not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they aren't using there whole brain to do they're work. One of the major reason why online classes aren't good because you can just google the answers that's just cheating you aren't learning it's cheating.

Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students don't listen or even look at the screen to the call. It's just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you won't have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldn't need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education.

The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they won't be able to anything for the future for there education because they didn't pay attention or learn it well plus they won't have any friends to know them.

In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.    ",3,Distance learning,Independent
153972503B34,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home?

In a way that's a great idea not only for students that have anxiety but for students that also have an hard time being in a loud class setting, Every student learns different. For example, take an student that lacks attendance in school or a certain class they'd love to have classes that they can take at home, Relying off what I previously stated earlier in my response every student learns differently and maybe at home could be a rejoice for some students,But it also has its pros and cons what are some pros you might ask? the pros are you can do how much work you want in an untimely manner, you don't have to get up earlier in the morning to get dressed you can stay in your bed clothes, also everything you do is in your secure location.

For example, first off no loud students, annoying teachers, and etc. Now for the cons. homeschooling doesn't give the child an actual high school experience in a way they don't have access to an teacher at that second or whenever they're stuck on an problem. As for myself, I take online classes right now at home and school and feel like its way better because the work gets done quicker and the house is quiet enough for me to work and learn, I also love listening to music while i work so in a way thats better than an teacher telling you that you can't do this is or that because you're at home.

I also know that many home school or online classes let you take your class when ever you want so that's an plus also you don't have to get up from your nice cozy warm bed in the morning, it's almost kinda like i'm torn in between because I like going to school also and seeing the different people that I go to school with instead of being at home in front of an laptop or computer screen everyday I have classes. It gets repetitive and you start to miss being around people regular school gives you the opportunity to meet new people join an club that you might have interests in also many sports teams that online schooling just doesn't have.

You know what I think should happen? i feel like they should make it so they have this class or location that's away from the rest of the school and the students that would love to do online schooling or classes could go there and still get the high school experience but without all the extra things they have to go through. although both have their separate own pros and cons the best option for me and i'm sure a lot of students would feel this way too is the online schooling yeah I feel like everyone should get their high school experience but not everyone has the mindset to come to school everyday.

For instance, imagine an scenario where an kid just lost an family member or has a very bad accident and getting up and going to school isn't the first thing on their list I feel like that's where they would implement an online schooling for that particular child because it happens a lot in the U.S. where children are falling behind and instead of putting them in online classes or so the school decides to fail them and put them in the same class that following fall or next school year not knowing what may or may not have happen to that particular child everyone's story is different and everyone comes from a different background and set of parents.

For my final reasoning why online schooling is an better option is because what if we have snow days or commonly in the US are school shootings first and for most, Snow days are common in Virginia and we have to make up those days we miss with online schooling we wouldn't have to do that we could all be on our online schooling taking the class for the day(s) we missed due to that snow day , Second off, School shootings have been a lot recently and with online courses and/or classes it cuts back on that dramatically, Finally let's talk about other things that could change/happen as a result of switching from regular schooling to online it cuts back on fights at school dramatically also it reduces bullying and other things and dropouts, But I know you're asking yourself but what if the student does't have access to such thing like an laptop or computer the school should issue out laptop and other things to the kids that need them. So in other words, online schooling would be the best option not only for myself, but for a lot of others as well who have an hard time with certain things not every students work ethic is the same some are slow others are fast some catch on quick others don't it just depends on who you are or how your work ethic describes you. Homeschooling also does not have an high dropout rate it has an 87% chance of graduation with homeschooling it's the better option. staying home, eating when ever you want, doing your work when ever u want, listening to music when ever you want. and so forth not to mention there is no time limit to homeschooling and also no stopping mark so u can go how far you would like. Yes 1000x times yes students would benefit more from homeschooling and/or online courses.                                                                                    ",3,Distance learning,Independent
BA881F8A8909,"Many students choose to participate in traditional and online schooling.

Online schooling can include video conferencing with teacher or enrollment in a class taken on the computer.

Giving students the ability to take classes from home is a widely debated topic.

Although some believe that students should only have the option of traditional schooling because they are less likely to learn social skills at home, students should be given the opportunity to participate in online schooling because it allows them to work at their own pace, lower their stress levels, and take multiple classes at once.

To begin with, students will be able to work at their own pace.

When taking a test in a traditional classroom, some students finish in ten minutes and others take the entire class.

Either way, students should not feel the need to slow down or speed up in order to finish in a certain time.

Forcing kids to work at the pace of their peers will produce lower test scores.

With the option of online school, students are able to finish assignments at their own time.

As a result, assignments will be given more attention by students and will overall turn out better than they would have in the classroom.

Students are capable of producing better work, if they are able to work at their own pace.

In addition, stress levels in students will significantly decrease.

Stress and anxiety among students is extremely high.

Many kids have test anxiety and are not able to perform well in testing environments.

Testing anxiety can be caused by numerous factors but one factor that stands out the most is feeling comfortable in an environment.

If the student does not feel comfortable in their classroom while taking a test, they will not produce a good grade.

If the student is placed in a well suited environment, like their home, they are guaranteed to receive a better grade than if they were placed in a classroom.

Secondly, if students are able take their time and not rush through school work, stress levels will reduce and the amount of passing students will increase.

Students often feel rushed to finish in a short amount of time in order to please their teachers.

Although many teachers preach to their students to take their time, teachers unknowingly put a time restriction on student.

Online courses allow kids to start and finish assignment when they feel comfortable doing so.

Online classes lowers the chance of stress among students by eliminating classroom anxiety.

Furthermore, the ability to take extra classes is given to students.

In order to graduate at many public and private schools, students must meet graduation requirements.

There are multiple classes a student must take to graduate that are electives.

These classes take up space in kid's schedules restricting the amount of core classes a student can take.

If schools allow these kids to take these classes in their free time, students will be able to complete these courses and move onto classes they will use in the future.

For example, all school require students to partake in a health class throughout their high school careers.

If students are capable of taking this class in the summer rather than in the school year, a new gap in their schedule opens for another class.

Also, online schools prevent advance students from burning out.

Many children who were placed in advanced learning at a young age experience a burn out.

This occurs when the student does not have to work as hard in their education as others.

This produces a poor work ethic, which is essential in the real world.

By allowing these students to take an extra course online, they will be challenged forcing them to improve their work ethic and time management.

Online school gives students a chance to get ahead in their education

In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to participate in online school because they will have the ability to work at a their own speed, reduce their stress levels, and participate in more classes.

If students are unable to take online courses, they are more likely to get off track in their learning.

By giving students this education outlet, students will be more likely to graduate and be ready to dive into their adult lives.",5,Distance learning,Independent
11F106935EDA,"Some schools that have an option for student to have attendance classes from home. Do you think that students should attend classes from school. Some people believe students should attend class from home while other people believe students would not have benefit from being able to attend classes from home. To attend classes form home, students would not benefit or help about their learning because school can improve teamwork skill, can make friends, and can ask the teacher.

Firstly, students can improve their teamwork skill to work as a group with other student. School have group work or the project that students can join together and work as a work. To illustrated, when the teacher give work to students that is a group work, and students should have a partner to work together, students have to talk to each other to plan what they need to do and help other understand what to do. Students can learn how to work with other person. The teachers must have group works for their students. Student should have teamwork skill because it will help them in the future when they have jobs to work will other person. Thus, for improve teamwork skill of students, they should attend classes in school that they can work as a group.

Secondly, Students can make friends in school. Students can relax and enjoy to attend classes when they with their friends. For example, after students finished their group work, they also have a good relationship with their partner. When students have friends, their can teach each other to understand to the classes and help to do their homework or class work. Students can make a lot of friends and help each other to pass the classes that maybe hard or easy for them. Therefore, to make friends is not hard to do when students are in school and school have many classes for help students to learn.

However, not everyone agree with this statement that some people believe students would benefit from being ale to attend classes from home because students can work and learn with their own way, have classes that they very want to learn, and help them to work in the computer. Nevertheless, look overs as an important point that student can ask questions to the teachers when they are not understand. When their friends can not help and do not know what to do students can ask the teacher for help. For example, When students do not understand in the class, and they can ask the teacher to explain or speak slowly for them to have more understand. The teachers also have to help their students to pass the classes, so teachers ready for students to ask them any questions. At home, students can not ask to the teachers if they are offline or no internet, and then they will ask their parents, but not all questions parents can answer. Therefore, the teachers can help students if they need help every times when they are at school and attend classes.

In conclusion, students should have attendance classes in school. Students can have to improve to their teamwork skill to work with their friends or other person in the future. Student can make a lot of friends, enjoy to the classes together and help each other work. Student can ask teachers whatever they want to know about the class, and teachers always help and answer the question that students asked. All of this are in school. Student will also get more experience from work as groups, friends, and ask the teachers. School can help student to attend classes because in school already have tools for student to learn.",5,Distance learning,Independent
D337DC4042D2,"Some schools offer distance learning for students. This learning from a distance caters to a new generation of students whilst also allowing more flexibility for the student. Although the schools may have reasoning specific to them, students also have much to gain from this opportunity. If the opportunity is taken and used correctly, a more secure environment will be available, online tutoring will be available, and a much wider range of schools will be available. These reasons outline the benefit that students receive from distance learning.

Firstly, a secure environment will be readily available for the student enrolled in distance learning. If learning can take place in one's own home certain advantages are guaranteed. These advantages include, familiarity with the environment, and quiet during the time of study. Familiarity with the environment allows the student to direct as much focus as possible to the subject that is being taught. Whilst at home the student is knowledgeable of their surroundings which leaves one less thing to be learned. If this were not the case and the student was in a regular school setting then there would be a multitude of distractions such as the classroom. The classroom is constantly vulnerable to disarray, because of the number of students using it throughout the day. If an online video conference is used then these distractions will not be seen by students. Other students will also not be seen which will drastically decrease the number of distraction sourcing from the behavior of others. Additionally, sound may prove to be an issue in the classroom for the same reason of having many more people in the room during learning. During a video call, students will be isolated from other sounds. Often conferences of this nature require push-to-talk, a feature limiting microphone activity to a button press. This will cut down on distractions because, if a student were to push this button and purposefully cause distractions it would be easily taken care of. The combination of the previous example, and the inherent control over sound in one's own home limits sound and assures quiet other than the teacher.

This distractionless environment will allow the student the utmost ability to focus on learning.

Secondly, if receiving lessons online, a student may be able to receive more additional help. This help can come in multiple ways, stemming from the teacher, or found online. Whilst a student takes classes through online means of education then they will also receive easier access to tutoring. The aforementioned lack of distractions allows class to flow much more easily, sometimes resulting in less time spent lecturing to a group. This group could also include infinitely more students giving the professor much more free time. After class has been completed for a day, a student can contact the professor for a one-on-one tutoring session in which direct instruction can be given, dramatically increasing the students personal understanding of the topic. Obviously online instruction also has the benefit of the internet. This inherent advantage can be used to look up additional examples if needed, along with easily connecting with peers that share the same misunderstandings with you. This allows for study groups to form more frequently, and successfully. A combination of these tactics can prove to be vastly more efficient and helpful than if learning in person, as a professor may not have the time, other students may have time constraints that do not allow for group study or tutoring in any other way, and the vast internet allows many examples and sources to be viewed at a moments notice.

Finally, schools will be much more accessible for students. This advantage stems from the wider range of schools available, less costly supplies, and much more flexible schedule. The internet is a world wide connection, this connection will also apply to students looking to learn through these means. For example, a student can live in Virginia, and easily take classes at MiT which is located across multiple state lines. This can be applied to any higher education in the world, and even lower education such as high school, if a student becomes severely injured. If taking classes from home, food and living expenses will be vastly cheaper. One will still have to pay tuition, but basic living expenses could be mitigated through splitting cost with others, and the possibility of living with one's parents for a while longer. This online connection also offers more flexibility as you wont have to plan most things, and leave, for example, thirty minutes before you are due in class, only to arrive late. Online can fix this because of the inherent convenience of a faster log in and show up time, five minutes instead of thirty.

Although these advantages are given to the student who chooses to take the opportunity of distance learning, there are some aspects that will, admittedly, be lacking. For example, face-to-face interaction will be unavailable, and social interactions with other students will be vastly more difficult to establish as a student may have to travel longer distances if desired. Many people believe that these two aspects are crucial to one's education. These interactions are part of curing social awkwardness and may be included as part of the learning process. Although, online students may receive more social interaction through chat rooms.

In conclusion, distance learning provides many advantages to students that traditional teaching does not. These advantages include secure environments, more available aid, and accessibility. The combination of these advantages can lead to improved grades and better experiences for the student. Even though the student may lack in person interaction, this can be supplemented by the sheer amount of interaction available online. Distance learning allows man advantages and should be offered for all students around the globe.",6,Distance learning,Independent
9DB1AA4819AD,"Many schools around the world offer long distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools will offer this if school has been temporarily shut down or if the student wishes to take a course the school does not offer. While a few number of people believe online school is unhealthy and wrong for students, in reality, online school provides many benefits and programs not offered by regular school. Online school has changed education for the better and made learning more accessible to people across the world.

In case of emergencies, schools have been known to close school and have the students learn online and do their work at home. If any diseases are running rampant or the school has a internal issue, schools tend to rely on new technology that will allow teachers to teach their students while they are in the safety of their home. Recently, the corona virus has been a problematic issue in my school area. The schools have closed one day off school to teach the teachers that if an emergency arrives and the students are not able to go to school, they will be able to teach from long distances and classes can resume as normal. Instead of a natural disaster or disease closing down school and stopping schools from functioning, educating students would continue without fear. The new age of technology not only increases the amount of information, but makes it more accessible.

Online school students also take online classes to get credits for classes their local schools do not provide. Current public schools do not offer every single class to satisfy every single student. A way of students going around that issue is online school. Online school provides almost every single course a student would want to take, from culinary classes to advanced mathematics. For example, my friend Generic_Name, a member of my school's Cyber Security Club, had just passed Cyber Security Fundamentals and was looking to move on to the next unit. However, my school did not offer Cyber Security 1, so Generic_Name talked to his councilor and was able to take the class at home using an online course and receive credits on his diploma. Online school provides more information, classes, and options to students who seek a broader education.

Critics argue that online school takes away from the personal experience of school and offers a way for kids to not go to school. While online school does take away party from the personal experience you would get at a public school, online school makes up for that with video conferencing and direct communication with the teacher and other students. Critics say online school kids use online school as a way to get out of going to real school. That statement is false, most students that take the online courses do this so they can work at their own pace and learn things not offered by his or her public school. Online school widens the range for students to learn and provides an alternative method to taking classes and learning in general. Students learn at different paces and online school gives students the power to work at their own pace without fear of falling behind in a class.

Over the past five years, online school has had a huge impact on learning and accessibility of information. It has become detrimental to a great number of students and a beneficial resource to schools across the world. It helps schools in crisis, provides more curriculum, and lets students work at their own pace. Without this resource our education system would be crippled and our students would suffer. Some may believe online school is anti social and negative for students, it is undeniable that online school provides millions of benefits and programs not offered by regular school. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
A7AB35E04C19,"Being able to have your classes online is very benefical for your present and future. There is an ongoing debate on whether or not distance learning is benefical. Those who disagree state there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it? I believe distance learning is very benefical to more than just the student.

Students will have less to worry about if they can't make it to school everyday. The attendance rates will go up because those who can't make it to school can still attend their classes online, leaving them with less stress. Makeup work for students will also be less of a problem, because they won't miss as much as they would if distance learning wasn't an option. This allows students to keep a stable grade while balancing school and other required responsibilities. More students will be able to stay caught up at school with distance learning offered.

Having distance learning also gives those who feel unconfortable being at school another option. If a student has a social disorder and doesn't strive in school due to their disorder, they now have the option to work where they feel comfortable through distance learning. This may also help improve their mental health by relieving stress. Those students who get bullied and dread coming school can avoid being bullied by having distance learning offered. This may make them more comfortable and help them focus on their school work, causing their grades to go up. Distance learning will be very benefical to those who are uncomfortable and can't do their best at school.

Distance learning could be very benefical and a great option for students. Those who disagree state: there will be a lower percentage of students present at school, teachers will have more work, and students have been required to come to school since schools have opened, why change it?

Technology as a whole has developed drastically over the last decade. Technology is such an amazing and useful part of things we do every day. One of the most life changing technological advancements that have been made, is online schooling or at home schooling. There are many positive things about online schooling and how it has helped shape our society today. At home schooling is a great option for many students because they can learn at their own pace, go to schools further away, and be sick less often.

The first reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they could learn at their own pace. Many students struggle with the fast pace school environment. For example, students are required to get to class on time, turn their work in on time, and even write down notes while keeping up with their teachers. On the other hand, some students think that the curriculum is too slow paced. Likewise, some students feel as though they are given too much time for assignments, too much time to get to class, or even too much time to take notes. Overall, students have different rates of learning, and the school curriculum doesn't always take that into consideration. Based on this evidence, it is logical to assume that at home schooling can allow students to learn at their own pace.

The second reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they could be given the chance to go to schools further away. Many students aren't able to go to a preferred school because they are too far away. Giving students an opportunities to take classes at home and online could allow them to enroll in classes at schools that they would rather go to. Also, a student might want to take a specific class that the nearest school might not offer. Furthermore, some students may already know what they want to do for a career and if so, they might need to take a specific class before starting that career. If the school they are attending does not have that class, the student could be held back from their fullest potential. It is obvious that at home schooling could allow students to attend and take classes at schools that are further away.

The final reason that students should be given at home class opportunities is because they would be sick less often. With less human contact, students wouldn't be sick as often and wouldn't come in contact with as many harmful illnesses. Also, even if the student were to get sick, he or she would still be able to attend school with out infecting their peers or teachers. This would, in return, allow students to continue their education while being sick without the fear of getting anyone else sick. This could also help to stop the spread of harmful diseases like chicken pox, measles, and other easily transmittable illnesses. Naturally, allowing students to take online classes can help them to be sick less often.

Many people say that students who don't have access to internet would be at a disadvantage. However, those students would still be able to attend a regular, tangible school or they could use guide books for each class. Having online classes would just be easier to attend for those who do have internet access at home. Since students would be able to work at their own pace, go to school further away, and be sick less often, at home schooling would be a great option for many students. Our youth would be very well educated if more schools started offering classes at home. Our society and future generations would be better developed as well. So please, speak to your school board members and propose the idea of at home classes at you local schools and make your community a better place. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
C55E751BB583,"Some schools has started offering distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online and or video conference, but some people don't think students will benefit from it while others think this is an incredible opportunity for students. some will argue that students will benefit more from distant learning than being stuck in a classroom because they can move at their own pace and not have to worry about being left behind by their other peers in the classroom. Also, students may need additional help so if they need that extra attention they can get it because it's just the student and the instructor. Next, Distant learning can help students who are behind make up credits they need to graduate and still take the classes they are supposed to be in. Although, Distant learning has its benefits people will argue that students will not benefit from distant learning. students will just take this opportunity for granted and need to be held responsible like everyone else and pass the class in the classroom.

Distant learning can be argued that students will not get the information the same as if they were in the classroom. Because students are not there physically with a teacher they are more likely to cheat then if they were at school taking a test. Then, there is no guarantee that students will open up their laptop or turn in their computer screen everyday. Also,It's more distractions at home than it is at school because students are going to be more worried about whats on Netflix or whats in the refrigerator to eat than paying attention to the instructor on the computer screen. Finally, students wouldn't have the same motivation to get up like they do when coming to school everyday to see their friends, significant others, and their best friends.

I personally think that students will not benefit from distant learning. I say that because it would be more of the class clowns and the students who didn't apply them selves in the program more than the kids who actually needs it. Wouldn't be fair for the students who works hard in the classroom and deals with all the distractions. Lets be realistic if you are not special ed you are more than capable to pass a class in the classroom with the rest of the students if you put your mind to it. I personally feel like schools are giving students too many ways for them to be lazy in the classroom. schools should hold students more accountable for the work they put in their work if the student is not doing the work he should be able to go home and take the class online when they are students giving it all they got in the classroom.

Distant learning has it's pros and cons but I feel like it has more cons than pros. Students are more than capable to do their work in a classroom and doesn't have to do work online in a classroom. What happens when you applying for college or a job and you need a teacher recommendation and your teacher was a robot in a computer reading you instructions how are you going to get a teacher recommendation ?

How about when you don't understand how something is being explained to you on the computer and you have no classmates to explain it to you in a easier way? what are students going to do when times like that happen ?

I'm going to tell you whats going to happen they are going to just give up or quit or they are just going to write down any answer or just answer anything just to get it done and end up failing the assignment, when he or she can't get teacher recommendations for college or a job he is not going to get accepted in the college or not get hired for the job. What i'm trying to say is that going to school might be a little more difficult, might not like going to school, probably would be anywhere else in the word than be at school, being at school gives you more opportunities in life than online school because the kid next to you could be a boss at a million dollar company and could offer you a job just because he went to high school with you.

03B874232827,"Recently long distance learning has been introduced to schools and has helped many students in many ways. Students are now able to learn from home instead of learning at school. Students would benefit form being able to attend classes from home because it would be more convenient, allow more family time, and allow the student to work at their own pace.

First, Students would benefit from learning from home because it would be more convenient. When a student is learning from home they wouldnt have to get dressed so go to school. They could stay comfortable in they're bed and learn. Students wont have to worry about distractions from other students because they would be alone. Another reason learning from home would be more more convenient is students could get more breaks and spend time to themselves.

Next, Learning from home is better than learning in school because you can spend more time with your family. When students learn at school they spend eight hours in school and then come home. Some students parents arent home when they get out of school and the students spend less time with they're parents. When students learn from home they can spend more time with they're parents. Students are more likely to be successful when happy and learning with family helps keep the student happy.

Furthermore, other people may argue that learning at school is better than learning at home because it allows students to be more socially active. But learning at home is better than learning at school because it allows the student to work at their own pace. In school students have timed class periods and they have to do the work in that time limit but at home they can work at their own pace. Working at your own pace can also reduce stress and allow the student to work more efficiently.

Finally, Students would benefit from attending classes at home because it would be more convenient, allow more family time, and allow the student to work at their own pace. This would also help students with learning disabilities. Students with medical conditions or injuries can benefit from this so they wont miss school.",4,Distance learning,Independent
1553852F57B7,"As a student enrolled in public schools I have had various experinces where I felt that I didn't fit in; or felt severe levels of stress and anxiey. I am now a junior in highschool and have now gotten somewhat used to what is required of me in a public school. If the the privilage of taking online classes would have been offered to me I wouldn't have lost my personality and mental health to the society that is seen in public schools. Now, that the oppurtunity of enrolling in classes online and studying from home is an option; people that feel that they wouldn't be able to handle the society in public schools now have another way to look. The concept that students may benefit from taking classes at home is valid because they would be able to achieve more focus and concentration and they would experince less stress and anxiety; thus strengthening their mental health.

Students may benefit from taking classes at home because they could gain more focus and concentration. There are some people who concentrate better when studying alone. These students enrolled in online classes may be more focused because they are in a more comfortable environment, which is their home. They will learn more because they don't have to wake up as early as people that go to public schools. They also wouldn't have to worry much about their apperance such as what they're going to wear, how their hair needs to be styled, how to hide their eyebags, if they need make up on, and what shoes to put on. They could also perform better academically because they have the oppurtunity of starting thier classes later. Having enough hours of sleep benefits students because it allows the brain to function at its full potential. The students could feel more enthusiastic about school because they don't have to listen to a teacher tell them what they can and can't do.

Students will benefit from taking classes from their homes in the form of having better mental health. Every human being at some point during their lifetime experinces the feeling of being nervous, anxious, or stressed. Most students experince this when they have to present themselves or a project infront of a class full of other students. Their anxiety rises especially in these situations because they feel like they're being judged or scrutinized. To add to their stress and anxiety the students have to deal with other students, teachers, and various homework assignments. They could also lose their personalities to the society found in public schools. Students often lose who they truly are when they are under an immense amount of pressure. Which leads to their mental health decreasing drastically.

Some may argue that student may become isolated if they take classes at home. Those that argue that claim may also think that student who take classes at home may lack communication skills, which are essential for the future. Others can also say the some students aren't ready to take on resonsibility that comes with taking classes online.

Overall, enrolling in classes that you are able to take at home can benefit students in the long run because they will feel less pressured. Their mental health would be strong and they would have a strong sense of self. They would also perform better because they would get the necessary amount of hours that a person needs to function properly.",5,Distance learning,Independent
22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes.

First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

I think,student should go to school because I believe that we can do better when we do thing that not just read books or study at home but we should go to school fore getting better.         ",3,Distance learning,Independent
FA5D64EC3C72,"Technology has been a huge component to help stimulate learning in students. With the availability of the Internet and technological devices in most schools today, there is a copious amount of resources students can use to help advance their learning in and out of school. From watching educational videos to doing online interactive activities, technology can be a student's friend to understanding more than what is taught in a classroom setting. There is so much the Internet can provide that we sometimes don't even need to be in a classroom to be able to learn. Distance learning has become so much easier with technology and the resources it has. Therefore, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can stay in touch with online communication, students can have access to many online programs to assist them in their learning, and students can use online resources to do assignments.

There are so many ways to communicate without being face-to-face with someone, so it's very easy to be able to know what is going on in a class solely from being online. In fact, relationships between teachers and students can be fostered well if the student is dedicated to communicating with his or her teacher often. With all the modes of communication made available, a student can contact a teacher via emails, video calls, voice messages, texts, or phone calls. I have taken a couple online classes for my convenience, and being able to communicate with my teacher has always been effective. I always got a timely response from my teachers, and they were able to reach out to me often to see if I had any questions. In my online Spanish class, we had a requirement to have a call with our teacher every week to talk about how we were doing on our assignments, so there was a good connection developed throughout the course. There are even options where you can collaborate online with students on assignments, which contributes to having more of a connection with others. Effective communication online can help students feel closer with others that they can't directly talk to.

With the abundance of programs avalable to students online, there's no doubt that a student can still learn just as much online as in a classroom. To learn the basic concepts, there are interactive programs embedded in a lot of online classes where you watch a video and answer questions to see how much you know about the concept. There are also live video calls to go over the material and talk to each other directly. This can mirror how a classroom environment is. I took an online SAT class where we would have to report to a video call portal at a certain time, and the teacher would make sure that we were able to answer questions as we learned the material. This has been a great way to learn for me, because I can still be just as engaged as I would be in a classroom. The best part of the system was that the teacher could save that lesson as a recording for us to go back and revise information at any time. Like this, there are so many variations of online classrooms where teachers teach as much as they can to students in order for them to be successful. So many students I know love this method of learning because it feels nice to be able to do the same things you could do at school in the convenience of your own house. Online teachers could get students to learn so much, all thanks to technology being able to replicate the feel of being in a classroom.

Any class requires students to be able to apply what they know with assignments and tests. Luckily, students online can do this easily with assignments and assessments embedded into their courses. There are many types of assignments that can be assigned with due dates because of the many things that can be done online. For example, in my history class we got a variety of assignments like writing essays, making a podcast, filling out graphic organizers, making slideshow presentations, and more. There are so many online devices that could be used for these type of assignments such as Microsoft Word, Google Slides, Google Drawings, and voice recorders. These are even used in classrooms everyday to do assignments, so online students get access to the same things that schools use. For test taking, there is often a system that online students have where they don't have access to any other tabs online to avoid cheating, and they get timed to represent how tests in school are often timed as well. Online classes are treated fairly in this sense where students don't get an advantage of being on the Internet to help them on tests, just like how it would be in school. Online students being able to do assignments similar to students in school makes online classes require just as much work and dedication as a normal class has.

To conclude, the advancement of technology has been the underlying reason why online students can get similar opportunities as school students. Distance learning doesn't hinder from the fact that students can make an effort to work with teachers and students, in order build good relationships when it comes to school work. Being online allows for effective learning where students can feel involved in the learning just as a student in school would. Online classes also provide the ability to be able to do a wide variety of assignments and assessments. Many students who don't have the convenience of taking a class at school now have the great opportunity to learn just as well as someone in a classroom would. Education has truly bettered from technology being able to serve so many purposes, and it can reach people of so many different locations who can now use the Internet for their learning everyday.        ",5,Distance learning,Independent

However, in a world where millions of people earn their living sitting in front of a computer screen at home, it is surprising that the education system has largely failed to follow. Many classes already contain significant online elements which are able to be completed at any computer, yet schools still require students to complete that work on in-school devices. Students would greatly benefit from being able to attend classes online at home due to the improved work schedule, more relaxed learning environment, and potential health benefits.

The most immediate benefits of online classes are related to the improved time schedule that they allow a student. With the current in-school system, students' class times are limited to the those set by the school in an attempt to best serve the huge variety of courses and needs of each student, all using the same bell schedule. Some students are inevitably ill-served by this uniform schedule, such as those that have other commitments late at night which cause them to lose out on sleep due to the early start times of school, or students that simply work better at certain times of the day. Additionally, different courses require different amounts of work, meaning that in the traditional block schedule, students may find themselves simply wasting time after completing their work for the remainder of one block, while they may be scrambling to finish their work by the end of another block. With online classes, students may also find that they can participate in daytime activities which they were previously either unable to attend while in school, or had to reserve for the weekends, having chosen to complete their classwork later in the day.

Another benefit of an online course program is the potential for a more relaxed learning environment. The classroom is not always the ideal place to learn or work, and by removing the need for students to physically enter a school building, they are enabled to choose whichever place works best for them to complete their work, whether that be in the comfort of their home or the solitude of a public library. This can increase productivity by allowing students to move away from distractions and set up their work spaces however they wish. In addition to this, the ability to work anywhere could also help to reduce stress, a major problem for students, especially those at higher levels. This is the result of giving students the freedom to pick who, if anyone, they want to work with, reducing social pressures that many students are negatively affected by, and allowing them to work on a less strict time schedule.

A final major perk of in-home learning is the potential health benefits for students. As they are, schools become breeding grounds for germs, as evidenced by the tremendous number of students who become sick each year during Flu season, or the waves of absences caused by a stomach bug. For many students, and even teachers, these illnesses would be entirely preventable, if they were not required to interact with hundreds of other people in close quarters, as would be the case if distance learning were implemented. This bonus would be especially helpful during outbreaks of rarer, stronger illnesses, such as the ongoing Coronavirus outbreak. Schools are under threat to be shut down during these outbreaks, causing major disruptions to student learning; disruptions that would be almost unnoticeable to students taking online courses.

The internet is a powerful tool, which could easily allow many courses to convert to an online-only experience, eliminating the need for students to physically attend school. Were this to become a reality, the time, mental health, and physiological health benefits would greatly affect students, and enable a myriad of new opportunities.                    ",5,Distance learning,Independent
68685615FE0C,"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.

First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.

Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher.

Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.

In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.     ",5,Distance learning,Independent
88FCD4D35128,"That some schools offer the option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that this option is a really good idea for the students. This option can benefit many students that cannot attend schools in the regular schedule. Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies.

Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies.

The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom.

One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people.

As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future.

I think that if more schools provide distance learning as option for the student, more people can get involve and be benefit with this program, and get better opportunities on their life. Because now that the school are doing this is not excuses to not finished the school.                      ",4,Distance learning,Independent
E0BBCFF37E53,"As of recently, the discussion as to whether schools should offer distance learning has come to light. Distance learning provides students with access to classes in a home setting. These classes are to be taken virtually with online and video conferencing. Although it is almost certain that this idea was proposed with good intention, the red flags that come with it are far too many to ignore. Students would not benefit from attending class at home because they would not have a concrete form of direct guidance, there wouldn't be a rigid structure of routine in their learning experiences, and students would undergo a significant lack of human interaction in their everyday lives.

Firstly, if distance learning was to take place, students would not have a concrete form of direct guidance to assist them throughout their school curriculum. The main reason that school is made mandatory for all minors, is to ensure that all children receive the proper education that they deserve. Enrollment in a distance learning course would remove the aspect of having a teacher in front of a student. It is important for students to be able to make eye contact with a teacher when learning, as it improves attention span and listening skills. A computed teacher cannot compare to a physical teacher's ability to respond and answer specific questions simultaneously. It is impossible to achieve the same dynamic of instruction and comprehension when learning virtually. When comparing distance learning students and in-school learning students, the in-school students are definitely reaping the most benefits.

Secondly, if students were to attend classes at home, there wouldn't be the same rigid structure in their learning experience. When students go to school they fall into a routine: waking up at the same time, attending classes in the same order, and eating lunch with the same people. Having class at home doesn't consist of any routine or structure because there isn't anything or anyone there to be held accountable by. At school, there is the bell or the possibility of receiving a ""tardy"" in a class that keeps students accountable to sticking to routine. In a home setting, there is nothing that would motivate the student to continue to pursue their education. Furthermore, in cases where distance learning has been tested out before, results show that students tend to fall behind on assignments and assessments. The reasoning for this being that the lack of structure in their everyday learning becomes detrimental to the student's chances of success in the class. Distance learning students would not benefit from attending class from home because the lack of structure and routine in their day is enough damage done.

Lastly, students would undergo a significant decrease in amount of human interaction in their everyday lives. One could argue that human interaction isn't necessary to a student's learning process. They may even bring up homeschooling as a comparison. However, homeschooling is the perfect example of how important being around other people is to one's mental development as a whole. Statistics show that 45% of home-schooled children struggle in social capacities after leaving their childhood home. Putting students in online courses is essentially confirming their fate to social incapability. Knowing how to properly communicate with others is one of the most important lessons taught in schools. Without interaction from their peers, distance learning students will end up conflicted in instances like work scenarios in the very near future. This is a problem that can be avoided with the simple elimination of all suggestions leaning towards virtual learning.

In conclusion, the topic of distance learning is controversial. However, the cons outweigh the pros by a vast magnitude. The decisions that must be made my school officials and superintendents should not be taken lightly, as the future of these students are in their hands. Students would not benefit from attending class at home because they would not have a concrete form of direct guidance, there wouldn't be a rigid structure of routine in their learning experiences, and students would undergo a significant lack of human interaction in their everyday lives.",5,Distance learning,Independent
D9B24103EA38,"A student lounges on his couch, eating cereal while listening to his professor give a lecture. While this scene may evoke a feeling of a relaxed learning environment, many, if not all students would actually find it much harder to experience a good quality education from home. By attending school from home, students would be unfocused and miss out on opportunities that only a physical school can provide. A school provides a specified location completely dedicated to learning. Students from all over get together and interact, learning not only the course material, but life skills in human interaction.

Many homes that house one or more students are normally very busy place. Take an average middle class family, around two parents and three children. At least one parent has work, so they are away for they majority of the day. The other parent must now be the one to shuttle the students to doctors appointments, and cannot leave them home. The parent would have to decide between taking their children to everywhere the parent goes, and distracting the children from education, or leaving them home alone. Either the students would not be able to focus on their work, or the parent would not get anything useful done. Say they had a nanny to watch the children while the parents work. Now the children have to be impossibly restrained to keep themselves from bothering each other. Imagine trying to focus on a physics lecture while trying to stop a young child from coming into your room screaming. Even if the conditions at home are completely perfect, a student needs to somehow remain completely focused. A screen with colors and sounds coming out of it does not hold one responsible as well as an in person teacher. The distractions could range from ""just taking a break"" to ""just getting some fresh air"" to ""I'm just going to go to the movies"". There is no real way the teacher could stop them. Many students lack self-control, or need to be taught it. These students would never learn that they can not just leave because something bores them. All, but especially young students would find focusing extremely difficult when not being held accountable.

Suppose the distractions are not an issue. A student sits down at his computer, switches it on, and is greeted by a neon light and artificial sounds. After the lecture, the student reaches out, switches the screen off, and takes a nap. This seems completely fine, but the student is missing a very crucial step; actual human interaction. This is vital for any functioning adult. No matter what job one has, they will always have to interact with another human. If a students life consists of just wake up, eat, watch a lecture, do the work, eat, go to sleep, then they miss out on human interaction other than their direct family for nearly eighteen years. That is absolutely not an ideal trade for the luxury of learning from home.

Some classes are altogether impossible to attend online. How would any musician learn to play in a group? Would they turn up the computer volume all the way just to hear a few other people? How would they play together if there is a delay in transmission? That completely rules out all of the musical department. What about workshop classes? Are the students expected to purchase thousands of dollars of machinery just to do a school project? Now the only classes available online are the ones that just pump your head full of words and facts. Nearly all schools also have extracurricular sports. These sports are much cheaper and easier to participate in than private clubs. Online, students can not exactly throw a baseball to each other. They would instead have to pay hundreds of dollars, even if they made they very selective tryouts.

After reviewing the negatives of the situation, it is apparent that they outweigh the positives. Just for the convenience of not leaving ones bed to take a class, one would have to give up human interaction, easily accessible activities, and the ability to distinguish a place of work from a place of rest. ",5,Distance learning,Independent
F21A02C66DAB,"It's hard enough for us to get our homework done as it is. There are too many distractions a home. Some students don't have access to the same resources at home that they have at their schools. Students would miss out on experiences and memories that would otherwise be made at their schools. Attending classes from home would not be beneficial for students.

Students around the world have different stories. They have different things that they go through day in and day out, and the distractions that they have at home aren't usually well known by other people. Whether it's financial issues, domestic violence, or even extracurricular activities. Students face different challenges, and they go through different trials and tribulations every day. For many students, school becomes a place to escape all of the stress that they experience at home.

Some students are in a place where they don't have access to certain things that could help them through their education. For example, not all towns have libraries in a close proximity that they can go to when they need a certain book. Schools usually have libraries and other ways to accommodate their students' needs. Another example is that not all students know what their next meal will be. Schools that provide free lunches eliminate this issue. Not having access to the abundant advantages that students get while going to a physical school can really ruin some students ways of life.

Many teachers and professionals might even say that school is more about the experiences and memories made than it is about the education you leave with. This is because there are many lessons to learn that aren't to be had in the classroom, but are rather gained throughout your interactions with those around you and in your classes. All kinds of events from a homecoming dance or senior prom, to a pep rally or a Friday night football game. All of them have takeaway moments for participants and for spectators alike. It might be harder to have those experiences, to make new friends, and to learn certain lessons from home.

While there are certainly students that can handle taking online school, distance learning is not worth the risk for the majority of students. This is because they might not be able to handle the pressure that comes with it. There are many disadvantages to taking online school. Experiences and memories will not have been made as they would have been at a nromal school.",5,Distance learning,Independent
80F2427F337D,"Distance learning is a method of teaching where students are not required to come to a class; however, they stay at home and watch the class through an online video or conference. While this may seem like a great alternative to having to get up early each morning and attend school everyday, it actually could have unintended consequences on the child. There are three main downsides to this form of online learning; those being that there could be more distractions at home than in the classroom, there would be less one on one time for the student and teacher, and the student would have a harder time making friends.

In a traditional school setting students may have trouble concentrating on the lesson because they want to talk to their friends. This issue will only be amplified if distance learning is used because there are even more distractions at home for a child. One of the main distractions would be the child's family and pets. If the child is part of a big family it may be hard to concentrate with the noise. The same issue would appear if the child has a baby in the house due to the baby crying or playing. The student may additionally be distracted by his or her own toys. If the child is watching the lecture in their room they may have the urge to play with their toys that are across the room. Students in normal schools are not allowed to be on their phones during class, but in this situation they could easily be on their phone without anyone ever knowing. If the class is only accessible online the students must have internet access. When the power is out or their internet is not working the students will not be able to learn. These distractions would all lead to students not paying enough attention in class and not retaining the information taught.

One more huge set back for children would be the lack of one on one time with the teacher. When teachers do not have each student sitting in front of them it would be hard to tell who actually understands the subject and who does not. In a traditional school teachers can go around the room and ensure that each child is doing his or her work correctly and if they are not he or she can help the student. With distance learning the teacher has no way of walking around the classroom and helping individual students. The student and teacher may be able to video chat and or email; however, that is not the same as having someone help you in person. Students normally form relationships with their teachers and are able to talk to and trust them. This type of relationship is not achievable with distance learning because students do not have the time between classes and after school to talk to their teacher like they would ordinarily. This absence of a relationship would become a problem especially if a student ever needed a recommendation from the teacher, because the teacher would not fully know the student.

Within a normal education system students have a few minutes between classes, recess, gym, and time on the bus to talk. This is not the case with distance learning, because there is no way for students to talk unless they go though the hassle of getting each others numbers and texting. While school is supposed to be a place to learn about subjects like math and English, it actually teaches kids how to make and keep friends. This is a lesson that it is very hard for a child to learn only from their family, because those relationships are different than friendships. Without the knowledge of how to build friendships in school kids have a much more difficult time forming relationships in life. By having only online classes, where students can not communicate face to face with each other, they are not learning how to build these important relationships with their peers, which will ultimately effect their adult relationships as well.

Distance learning in theory appears to be a new and better approach to learning and school in general, but, as previously mentioned, there are many unintentional side effects that hurt students. There are some up sides to this method such as no need for transportation and more free time for the child; however there are also downsides such as more distractions and less one on one time with teachers. Ultimately, distance learning has more bad effects than beneficial ones and therefore should not be used instead of the present school system. ",6,Distance learning,Independent

BB9B2400BE18,"Do you go to other people for help or for advice when in a situation or problem? Whenever I am in the middle of a problem I always go to my friends, maybe even my mom. My mom makes me look at the problem at a different perspective. However, my friends help me solve the problem. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, for example, better knowledge, stronger reason of choice, and different perspective.

When someone gives you advice they either have been in the same situation or they must just be a little wiser. They have better knowledge and can help you make your choice. If you don't know much then you can make a choice and it may not have been the best. In my opinion, going to someone else for advice knowing they've been where you are right now and they are willing to help you not make a bad decision I would listen to them. Depending on the situation your in, it may or may not be the best choice, but it's something to keep in mind.

People have different opinions. One you can agree with and the other you might not agree with. But the more the people give you their opinions the more of a stronger and more firm choice you'll make. The choices you make have consequences. And if someone had already done that and there were bad outcomes. Then you probably don't want to follow in the same steps.

There are different perspectives in everything. You only look at it in the perspective you want to look at it by. Like how someone wants you to do track but you don't want to because your scared and don't think your good enough. Someone can tell you that you will get better at it by practicing and that they are as well scared but are willing to try it because they like running and so do you. So looking at it in a different point of view can help you make your choice.

These three examples, better knowledge, different perspective, and stronger reason of choice, could help you a lot when making a choice. Sometimes listening to yourself is the best choice. However, you don't want to make your own decision making when you do not have enough knowledge, it can be very stressful. But in most cases seeking advice is the best way to go. Just make sure your comfortable with your choice and nobody forces it onto you because they are ""wiser"".",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
10C813389A74,"People like me like to think what their choices are when people give advice. When I get advice from one person I have to ask another person just to see if they would give the same advice. I like to know that i have choices to pick from but thats it about me. People like me like to hear everyone opinions just to whats different about what we think. Sometimes we dont have that right advice to give ourselves so we hear what other people have to say.

When people take advice from one person they dont know if they telling the best advice that is good for them so what we do is ask someone else just to see if we can get better advice from someone else. When you hear advice from just one person maybe you don't feel like that was the advice you could of got, so we ask different people what there advice would be to see if you have a better choice. We know that everyone is different no one ever has the same advice but some people dont give the best advice and some people give great advice.

A lot of people give different advice we will not think is correct or maybe we think its the best but sometimes we got to keep our choices open. Ex: when are mom give advice it may not be the best so you may ask your dad to see what he will say and he say something way different then what your mom said so now you like you dad advice more the your moms. There is nothing wrong with getting advice from 10 different people. some one may not like that advice that the person give them so what they do is ask some friends or mom an dad just to be able to think. Maybe you might come up with your own advice but dont think its the best so you hear other people opinions. Having choices to run through is always good cause you can can like like that advice someone give you but you know that might not be like best or you might not like it so ask people. When you have choices to go around you can make the best choice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
2962D1BB17A2,"Say you don't know what to make for dinner, or you're having trouble making a difficult decision. You're probably going to ask someone's advice. Now when asking advice, we don't usually ask just one person do we? No! We ask 2 or 3 different people. Friends, family members, and even neighbors.

It's helpful to get a second opinion on some things, because everybody has different experience than others, everybody knows you differently, and different people have different opinions.

Everybody has different experience with different things. For instance, if you are writing an essay, you could ask your parents advice on how to start, and what to write about etc. They wrote a ton of essays back when they were your age but the writing curriculum was different. Then you could ask your English teacher as well. He/She has plenty of experience in the field of writing, and can give you their thoughts on the subject, with an up to date curriculum. After that, you can take both groups advice, and use what you like best to write a better essay than you would've if you had just asked one of them.

You are a different person to all of the people you know. To your friends, you're someone to joke around with. To your teachers you're a student. To your parents, you're a huge pain in the butt. But if everybody knows you differently, then you will get different advice from different people. For example, asking someone what to wear to a party. Some of your friends would say: ""Oh dress comfortably I know you like to wear clothes that are comfortable!"" and other friends would say ""Dude we know you like to be all 80s retro and stuff dude, dress like that!"" and your parents might say ""Dress correctly and appropriately as if you were going to school, or an interview."" They all know you differently and can give you different advice that can help you make a good decision.

We all get in arguments with other people. Why? Because we all have different opinions! We cant all always agree on the same decision every single time! Like if you ask your mom what she thinks you should get for your girlfriend, she'll probably tell you something like a bouquet of flowers or candy. But if you ask your dad, he might tell you to get them something like a necklace or bracelet. You will get different ideas from everyone but sometimes having more options is a good thing.

Thats why seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better decision. Different people have different experience, everybody knows you as a different person, and everybody has a different opinion on matters. So next time you're troubled on what to do in a difficult situation, or you're stuck in a writers block of some sort, remember, ask advice from a few people. It might help you make a better decision.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
B8321F8B104D,"Would you want help from one person are multiple people? I would want more help not less. People ask for advice from multiple people because the people they are asking may of had the problem before and know what to do and they don't know it, and different people give different advice for the same thing.

Choose between a person how had the same experience as you or 10 people that has not which one would you ask for advice. People how have the same problem are most likely going to give you good advice because they know the trouble of the situation and how to get out of it. Not everyone is going though the same problems as you so trust their advice not everyone else. If they know what to do then do it.

Advice is weird someone says some to help you and the someones says the opposite. If no one knows what you are going though then trust the words of the many but only then. it is good to take in all the advice in like a sponge but release the unhelpful one like things you already know are not going to work.

The more advice you have the more changes that are helpful. Many people don't know how to give good advice so ak more so ou can find people who do give good advice.

People who have good advice are out in the world so ask people don't just stand there and wait just ask. It is good to ask lots of people because the more helpful adivice he better.

F1D42413F451,"If you have an issue, speaking to more than one person can help you in many ways. This is because you can get multiple opinions, and a better outcome to your issue or problem. You may not know it, but you also have plenty of people you can go to. Seeking multiple opinions is also good, because you will figure out the good outcomes and the bad outcomes of your situation; or situations similar to yours.

Speaking to more than one person can give you multiple opinions, all of which can be helpful in deciding what to do. One person who had a bad experience might give you what they did, making everything worse. This is especially true when the issue involves people. If you ask one of your friends, and they say yes to something you know is bad subconsciously, you should get another opinion. Once you go to another loved one, their added advice can lead to a better close to your issue.

When you have a conversation with more than one person, you can get multiple opinions, different points of view, and different experiences. You can combine these into a chart, and then decide what to do. You might use a combination of things you were told. Getting multiple points of view on a topic can really help with your final decision. If you ask your mother, and she tells you something positive, but ask a friend, and they say something partially negative, you can put what they did together, and create your own solution. Different experiences is essentially the same as different points of view. Having multiple can help you to create your own solution, or use one that worked for someone else.

Now that you know what you can do, who are you supposed to ask? The answer: anyone you trust. Your mother or father are the best option. This is because you are the most comfortable speaking with them, and they've lived through most of the same situations. Next, is a trusted teacher/adult. These people most likely have experience with your predicament as well. If you have friends that you trust and support you, you can ask them about your issue. They may just be able to help. Regardless of who it is, you need to trust the person.

In closing, getting many opinions on an issue can help you make good decisions, and create better outcomes to your issues. Knowing who you can speak to on these problems is very helpful as well. Having people that you can speak with makes you more confident in your decision making, so you can become an amazing problem solver. Using what other people know, and what you know can be put together to create the best possible solution. Help others when they ask you. You might not be the first person they ask, but at least they trust you enough for assistance.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
DF9580284892,"When people want to ask for ideas or advice, they sometimes go ask more than one person. Asking more than one person is better than asking just one person. If you ask one person for advice its not the best because you are only getting one idea. If you ask more than one person like 10 people than thats better because you have lots of different ideas and opinions. In my opinion asking more people is better because i get multiple opinions to help[ me make a better choice. If you feel comfortable asking just one person then do it, but having multiple opinions will help you make a better choice. So lets say you want to get advice on how to get a girlfriend. You go to your best friends house and ask him, hey whats some advice or tips on getting a girlfriend and he gives you some advice and tips. Then you go and ask your parents, elders, teachers, and more friends and they all give you a bunch of ideas and opinions on how to get a girlfriend. Those are my thought on why its better to ask more people than just one person.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Instead of asking just one person for their opinion, people should ask multiple people. The information gained from multiple people in much greater than from one person aswell. When asking a group of people for their opinions, the better choice is much probable to happen. Getting multiple opinions on a topic can help incredibly, the information is less biased, the outcome could be better, and the choice becomes easier to make.

Getting many opinions on a topic could give people less biased information. When asking for someones opinion, they are more likely to give you biased information. Their opinion might not be biased towards them but the information could still be biased. When someone asks multiple people for their opinions they could filter out the information and get one unbiased statement. Getting more opinions on a subject could give people less biased information.

Getting the better outcome could become more likely if someone asks multiple people for their opinion. When someone asks someone else for their opinion, they will likely give them the choice they made. The choice they made could be good but, there could be better outcomes. When asking many people for their opinion, people can decide which outcome is the best and make a better choice. When someone asks multiple people for their opinion, the better outcome can be found.

Choices become easier to make when someone asks many people for their opinion. When someone asks just one other person for their opinion, it is harder to make the decision. However, when someone asks multiple people for their opinion, they can see which choice is the best to make. Getting many opinions can help someone see which choice has given a group of people the better outcome and which has not. When someone asks multiple people for their opinion, choices become extremely easier to make.

7A425A58F136,"When making a decision, sometimes you need to get some advice, but you might not see why that's helpful. Advice is when you take suggestions or ideas from someone about a certain decision you have to make. Whether it's from a friend or family member, advice can help in many ways. The main benefits you get from getting advice are that you see another perspective, you experience varying opinions on the subject, and you see other solutions.

Getting another perspective can be helpful when making a decision because you get to see the issue or decision through someone else's eyes. Opening your mind to new ideas and opinions can help you become a more accepting and kind person, just from this one experience. You might have one opinion your whole life, but if you experience the situation from someone else's point of view, you can see that you might have been wrong. Additionally, even if you don't change your mind because of another person's points or opinions, you still are able to accept their ideas without it bothering you that you disagree. From doing this one small thing, you can figure out how to solve your problem, and you can develop as a person, which is always a good idea, regardless of the circumstance.

You should always seek help from multiple people because it can be even more helpful than getting just one person's opinion. If you get advice from three friends, they will probably all have different answers. However, after hearing those answers, you can debate the different pros and cons of each, and, eventually, you can come to a final conclusion. Whether your solution is one of theirs or some kind of combination, you were helped by asking for multiple opinions. Also, hearing various opinions can open you up to more perspectives, which benefits you in the ways previously stated.

Seeing those other people's opinions can also lead you to see other solutions to your problem. No one has to be wrong or have the wrong opinion, so when you get the opportunity to think about other solutions, it can benefit you and maybe others. For example, if you need a new frying pan, you might think you should just go buy one from the store, but your friend could have another idea. Let's say they have two frying pans, but they only need one. If you ask for their advice, they would suggest that you should have one of theirs as they don't need or want it. Because of this, you would save money and find a solution to your problem, while also helping a friend in cleaning up their kitchen. That solution benefits both of you, showing just how helpful advice can be.

In conclusion, getting advice is always a good idea as it opens you up to new perspectives, differing opinions, and more solutions. New perspectives can open up your mind to help you not only solve your problem, but to be a better person. Also, seeing more solutions can benefit you and possibly others. And finally, getting differing opinions can help you see all sides of the argument, so you can make the right decision. From thinking about these three points, you can see that there are no downsides to asking for advice, especially from multiple people.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
7C1D05780C33,"Well,this seems like a simple question with a simple answer but knowing me ill not make this simple in the slightest. Everyone had asked for advice in there life it's common this do in daily life,but sometimes we are uncertain of the answer we get after we ask for advice. Sometimes more than one person may help with a certain problem you have or may soon have. But is talking to an extra source helpful yes, yes it is. Here ill prove it to you.

When your shopping you always wonder ''Am I getting the best price?''If not your crazy. If you do than this is one of the time multiple opinions that may help. Here is a example. your shopping for a car and the price that the dealer ship is supisously to high you would probably look for people who have that car and ask for an opinion on how much should I buy it for so you know your not being scammed out of your money or maybe you can find out a way to get a much better car at a far better price. The possibility are endless when it come to buying things. This here is another example. I have an interest in LEGOs but I always have trouble when shopping for them and its always the same problem. The price,LEGOs,they a very fun yet expensive toy,A medium sized set could be over $50! As a kid that would be all of my saving but i've found a way to get them for a far better deal than I could ever hope and I do this by asking several people during the time my neighborhood has garage sales to see if there is any way I could get my hand on some LEGOs at a great bargain that and you always have EBay.

Imagine your in school but the day before you where really sick and couldnt remember if you had a test or your homework due that that day well never fear communication is here and with it you can check all of your best sources like your friend Generic_Name or Generic_Name they are both sources you can rely on because there are your friend and they would never lead you astray,right? All jokes aside this could be super yes I said super and i'm not five but this is super helpful lets throw in another example. Your walking home when you get a text from a friend they say that spring break will now be two weeks long and your unsure but when you ask another friend and they say its two weeks long and so your convinced,but what you didnt know as well as your friends is that the school announcements were off and that there was just one week of spring break and so you now have been gone from school thinking that school was out but in reality you have just missed a whole week of school. The sad part of this story is it could have all been avoided if you just confirmed with a few more sources. This does not only apply to school though. They just the easiest of the examples.

Now I know there will be at least one person who will have no one to talk to even about this. Never fear thats why the internet is here! Seriously these day you have all of the knowledge and opinions in the world at your finger tips but not only that but hundreds of sources that will indeed confirm any question or help you with an problem or get you any advice you need. this is not the only way other than human way to ask questions and be able to confirm you answers with it books not thousands but millions of books to chose form some are for stories but many are for information,information that can be confirmed with even crossing over the internet and humans to get the best advice or information ever!

Now you know all of the many ways and reasons to get multiple responses for many things need for everyday life. So now you know that with multiple opinions and facts you can make the best choices on nearly everything except gamboling you should never get hooked on gamboling because it bad so make sure you get multiple opinions and dont gamble because its bad!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C493B582595E,"Have you ever asked for advice?

I'm sure that you have.

Everybody needs a second opinion at some point in their life, right?

Why did you ask the people that you did?

When asking someone for help in a situation, it can be difficult if they are saying opposite of what you are thinking.

At that point, you wonder, ""Were they the wrong person to ask?"" or ""Should I go with my gut?"" or whatever.

Sometimes it is better to trust your gut and not go to other people.

Other people can influence you to second guess yourself in a situation that you're stuck in.

Why can asking for another opinion, or even asking more than person, help the brain decifer right from wrong?

This comes down to human nature.

We are born with the ability to use our brains to our advantage.

This being the case, how come it is so hard to make up our own minds about a situation that we got ourselves into in the first place?

By the time that you are mature enough to think for yourself at any level, you automatically start to second guess yourself.

Why?

This question can be used in many scenarioes, but in this one, there isn't really an answer.

When you take a deeper look into the brain, you find out that every section has a part to play.

You eventually realise that every nerve, every strand, and every circuit is important.

If you think about it hard enough, you come to the recognition of the fact that one nerve placed differently, has the possibility to rewire your your thought process.

With all of this playing a part, it proves that your brain can do the unthinkable (get it).

So, getting back on topic, if our brains can run a human body, then why can't we make our own decisions?

We make decisions every single day of our lives.

Every decision that you have aver made has lead you to this moment doing the specific thing that you are doing down to the very second.

How many tines do you think that we ask for advice just in a year?

How do we even know that the person that we ask doesn't give you the wrong advice?

How do you know when it is best to go off of your best judgement, should you get an opinion on that from someone else?

The worst part is, there really aren't answers to provide for all of these strenuous questions.

Unfortunately, that is just one more thing for you to debate in your head.

The process of asking people for advice my not be that simple, but it is a positive thing to ask for help in a situation that you dpn't know how to deal with.

BA18C6F80423,"If you had to make an important decision, would you go to one person and ask for their opinion or go to multiple people and ask for their opinion? In my opinion, going to multiple people and asking them for their help would be the better choice. This is true because then you'll have a variety of knowledge, based upon how other people reacted to the same situation. In addition to that, is so that you don't get a biased opinion.

One reason for seeking multiple opinions is so that people will have a variety of knowledge to choose from. This will help better prepare them when they have to choose between their options. Furthermore, it will help them face the consequences of their action. They will also know that they chose the better option based upon the opinions that they were given. Getting multiple opinions will also help them when they learn from other people's mistakes. Like, if they had to choose from going to a movie or going to study for a test. If they went to somebody who doesn't really care about the test, they will most likely choose to go to the movie. But if they ask their elder brother or sister, they would say, based on experience, don't go the movies because if you fail your test, mom and dad would ground you for a month. Then based on the opinions given to them they would choose the best choice. In addition to that, no one knows everything about the whole world. So why would someone go to one person. Maybe they don't even know anything about it and give bad advice. If they only went with one opinion and that was their first opinion and they acted on it, they would have probably chosen the worst choice and would have to face the consequences of that choice.

Another reason why people should seek multiple opinions is so that it is not biased. Going back to our first example, if that first opinion had been biased, how deep into trouble would that kid had been in if they went to the movies. Furthermore, that is from a kids point of view. What if someone wanted to make a business deal with someone else that's worth around a million dollars, and their colleague tells them to not do with that company. Well they want the deal to be perfect, since so much money is on the line. So they want to make sure the advice is actually based on cold, hard facts not flimsy opinions. That is why you should take advice from multiple people not just one. Whoever is getting advice can also cross check with someone else and see if their advice is actually worth it. Just because someone trust someone else a lot doesn't mean that they are right.

In summary, that is why I think that, when taking advice, it's best to take it from multiple people. This is true because you will then have a variety of knowledge and you won't have a biased opinion. Consequently, you won't have a hard time with choices that you are making.

436637E5292F,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They believe that receiving more input on an opinion is very helpful. They're not wrong for having those thoughts; in fact, getting ideas from multiple people is a smart action that can help in a myriad of ways when trying to make a better decision. This is because more input can foster better accuracy, give the questioner more options to choose from, and can offer some ethics on different opinions.

First, I stated that seeking multiple pieces of advice helps make the ultimate decision more accurate. When a person has an opinion on something, often times the opinion has little to go off of. Usually, this leads to someone misunderstanding the content of their thoughts on the matter. In some cases, bad things can occur from this. Being able to hear the platforms of others will help the questioner avoid severe misunderstandings. Having and understanding those thoughts will help in building a strong base for their opinion, saving some people from a confusing time.

Another reason why listening to what other people think is useful is because it gives the questioner different choices to choose from. Sometimes, people will prefer to go with the opinions of others instead of formulating their own. Many want to conform and fit in, while others do not have the energy to decide for themselves. Some are just unable to form an opinion on the specified topic. Whatever the reason, asking more than one person on their basis is really helpful for them. For example, someone who can't decide something can usually look up to their friends for a better choice. Someone who wants to choose a team to root for during a game but can't think of which to pick can go with the side with the majority of supporters. Seeking multiple opinions can also help with many other situations like this.

More often than not, one has already made a decision, but they're unaware of the benefits and consequences that go with their choice. Listening to others usually clears up most of those cracks. Naturally, people have their own opinions on other's decisions. By inquiring those people about their thoughts, one can easily determine the ethics of their decision. On occasion, it might make one reconsider their choice. On other occasions, it can help one feel more confident in their opinion. Basically, it is very important to know what one will be doing right and wrong with their choice.

When asking for advice on something, many find it helpful to ask multiple people. They think that with multiple answers coming from multiple backgrounds, a better decision can be made on their end. It is, in fact, a smart way to handle decision-making. Three reasons why are because it gives accuracy, more options to pick from, and the ethics that come from one's opinion.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Asking people for advice might help you become more successful in life by taking the advice you get.

If you can understanding the advice you get it may help you make better decision, an example will be if you want to buy a house a car or a object that might cost a lot of money, you probably ask multiple people for advice and you will think about it if you are doing the right decision or not.

Asking people for advice benefits everyone because they can know your point of view and you can know their point of view, and after you guys talk to you can understand why they think that advice will benefit you and it might change your perspective towards that advice, we are all different and our opinion might change of how we think about that advice.

How can asking multiple people about advice better? Sometimes the persons advice can be bad. People think differently, so it can lead to different outcomes. Not many people can understand the advice they ask for.

All in all, asking multiple people for advice is better than asking one person.

First, you could be asking someone for some advice, but it's not good advice, so you ask someone else. You can ask a random person for advice, and the give you some advice you would never do, then you ask someone else. People can ask other people for advice, because the person they ask before gave them some advice that they know they would get you in trouble. In summary, asking one person for advice and that persons advice is bad, you can always ask someone else.

Secondly, you can ask as much people as needed for advice, but they can all lead to different outcomes. You can ask your friend for advice, and they give some good advice, but your scared of the outcome, so you ask someone else. Sometimes you could be scared or nervous about the outcome of the advice someone gave you, that you ask another person. Many people think differently, and have different outcomes that you don't like, you can keep on asking other people. In total, people minds think differently, and they think about different outcomes that you are terrified or nervous about, so you ask someone else.

Third, you might not understand the advice people give you, so you ask someone else to see what they say. People can give some good advice, but at the same time say it in a way not many people can understand. Some people can think of great advice, but they don't know how to put it in words. Many kids and adults get nervous sometimes when their friend ask for advice, and they mumble or stutter what they are trying to say, and their friend can't understand what they are saying. In conclusion, not many people can understand advice other people give them.

Finally, asking multiple people what they think you should do, is better than asking one person. You can never know if the person you ask for advice, is going to give you good or bad advice. Some people give different advice, which can lead to different choices. Not many people can give advice clearly.

If someone were to ask another person with lots of life experience, they'll probably get a reliable opinion on the situation. Plus, if you ask for advice from various people it's as if you're taking a poll on which choice would be best. There are several legitimate reasons to ask multiple for advice, and doing so is extremely important.

People can rely on the elderly, or more experienced people, to get credible advice in a situation. A good example would be Master Oogue, featured in the beloved movie ""Kung Fu Panda."" Po, the main character of the movie, turns to Master Oogue for advice in his situation. As a result, Po get's a valuable perspective and comes to his decision. There are numerous examples as to why someone should trust experienced people for advice.

When a person asks for various perspectives, they will most likely go by the advice most people have aforementioned. Everyone goes through different experiences and events. So, asking more people will have a more successful outcome. Asking multiple people gives you a more impartial opinion and will not be affected by unusual bias.

0EE6F614F2F0,"Have you struggled and asked someone to help? People often do this to search for the answer or an alternative. Seeking more than one opinion can provide someone with better choices because it gives them a new perspective and can better themselves.

One way multiple opinions helps to get better choices is gaining a new perspective. First, someone with the help of others can find out new and improved ways to solve the problem. A new way to solve can lead to a completely new and beneficial solution. This can result into the right choice to make. Secondly, someone who knows more than you about a subject can reinforce their idea, so the opinion seems better and more reliable. For example, if someone asked an old science professor about the parts of a plant cell, the professor will be able to answer that question confidently and reliably because they've been teaching science for a long time. This proves that getting an professional opinion can help others with their choices. Thirdly, peers could influence perspective and help with better choices. Others often trust a close and helpful friend rather than a random person. Overall, looking at a new perspective can better someone's choices by finding a new solution, getting professional guidance, and gaining the help of fellow peers.

Another way of improving the choices others make is to strengthening themselves by listening to others. People can improve themselves and the choices they make by listening to constructive criticism and feedback. For instance, I asked people to review my project and I was told some feedback. I learned from that experience, improved my abilities and I now make the right choices when I work on projects. Not to mention, people can help make better choices by getting emotional support from others. Someone could be going through a rough time and not making the best choices, but they can search for multiple view points from others. This can result in people helping that person out and leading them to conduct better choices. Lastly, people can help make improved choices by gaining motivation. Motivation from others could help someone keep pushing forward and make correct choices, so that they can improve and learn. In conclusion, getting multiple opinions can improve someones choices by listing to feedback and criticism, getting emotional support, and gaining motivation.

Getting a lot of ideas and opinions can give someone better choices and opportunities because it gives a fresh view point and can improve ones self. People consult other people to find better choices and in doing so, usually benefits the people involved. All in all, an open perspective and improvement in themselves is why gaining multiple opinions helps result in good choices.    ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
EF1E56E86D9B,"How can seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice? It can help the person make a better choice because the more advice or opinions you give to that person the harder they think about what choice their gonna take. But not in all cases it's the same because everyone is different and every person has a different mindset,It can help people in a good way and in a bad way.

For example if a person who was seeking opinions or advice about what car to buy, they would ask for opinions from their family or friends about whats a great deal or price on a car?,Is it in good condition?,Does it have good mileage? Because that person doesnt want to buy a car thats not gonna be worth buying and, Their can be so many opinions and that would make the person think really hard about what decision he's gonna take because not everyone is gonna have the same opinion about the same car.

Many people can make bad choices too,like for example if teenager was to dropout of high school and didn't ask for opinions and advice about the situation he would most likely pick the bad choice and regret It after. If he wouldve gotten multiple opinions from people,they would tell him not dropout of school and they would explain their reasons why he shouldnt pick that route or choice and that person would really think about it and would think about the consequences.

Another example can be about having a baby a lot of people would have very different reasons if you should have a baby or not and depending on your age. If the person is around the age 21 they should ask a lot of their family members of what they think about having a baby,and if your asking yourself this, why should we ask for multiple opinions from our family members or parents? Because there those kinds of people who probably have already gone through that situation. And its best to ask people who have gone through a lot stuff because they might ve gone through really bad stuff or made really bad choices in there past and they would probably would be glad to help you out to make the better choice then they did.

Overall I think seeking multiple opinions and talking to more than one person can really help you out in a lot different ways and dont get me wrong their are cons too but I wouldnt say there are more pros because everyone has different opinions and advice. It can make a lot of people successful in life and in many other things too just because they took peoples advice and listened to their opinions. It can make other people make bad choices too probably because they took the wrong advice from the wrong person or didnt even ask for opinions or advice.           ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

When seeking advice, turn to who you feel are your most credible sources. Teachers, parents, and trusted adults can all lend you helpful tidbits of information. People usually give advice to you as if they were giving it to their past selves, so advice tends to be full of bias. There are also a lot of many-sided ethical dilemmas that have completely different answers depending on who you ask.

Always follow the advice that makes the most sense to you. When people are throwing their opinions out there, they will usually tell you what works best for them. For example, when asking for advice about how to study, not every tip is going to apply to you, because everyone has different learning styles. You might want to ask many people and only use the advice that you like most, or that you feel would work for you.

If you are too shy about asking for advice, you may be tempted to look on the internet. Do not look on the internet first. Always ask your parents or other trusted adults before embarking on the quest to find advice on the internet. You may find articles written by random strangers who are writing for a much older audience with different needs or wants than you. Since they are writing mostly for everybody, they will not consider everybody's needs, and will speak for the default demographic.

Remember to always ask more than one person for advice, and to follow the advice that you feel would help you the most. Ask parents and trusted adults before consulting anyone else, and especially before consulting the internet. Armed with this new toolkit of knowledge, you are now ready to ask for advice the right way!",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
E5C524E8ECB8,"Do you think asking more than one person for advice is a good idea?

Well I think it is, believe it or not when you ask people for advice they have been through the same situation.

Going to ask for advice from more than one person is important.

When you want more advice you should talk to your parents, friends , or a older sibling.

The first person you should talk to is your parents because they are way older than you and they have had more experience with these type of situation.

They also know you better than anyone would because they have raised you and know what the best way for you is. The last reason you should talk to your parent is because they have most likely gone through this problem before which means that they know what will work the best and what wouldn't work.

Most of the time when you ask your parents for advice they give you what solves the problem.

The second person I would recommend talking to is a trusted friend.

They can give you some good advice because you spend almost 6 hours with them at school so they know what happening around you during school.

They would also be pretty honest with you because they want to give you advice that is good for you and that would help.

The final reason to talk with a friend or friends is because this is someone who you can talk to if you don't want to talk about it with you parents and you want to see what they would say before mentioning it to you parents.

The final person I would go talk to is an older sibling.

I would talk to them because they have been in your shoes many times.

So the advice they would give you would help you because it helped them.

Also they can keep this away from your parents.

Not only are they going to give you advice one what you asked them but they can keep it away from your parents until your ready to ask them.

Finally I would ask an older sibling for advice because they are older for a reason.

They most likely are there to help you when you need to so I would use it while you can before they either leave for college or already have left.

Asking more than one person for advice because the more advice you can get the better then end result is for you.                 ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

If you ask more people you can get the same pr different responses from the people. you had seen a cute girl but you don't know what to do so you need some help to make something and you need advice on how to make it.

Let's say that your in a small town but you just move here and you son had seen a cute girl so he ask he's dad if he knew any advice for him to make a move. He's dad had some good advice but the son want more advice like who do I get her to like me back so we went to get some more advice from is family. The son went to is grandpa first then is uncle and they both said the same thing to but the his dad's advice was totally different. The second week of school the son had had seen her again probably because she is in his class the day went on and on then the school day's over and the boy went home. Before the boy left the school a different girl came up to him but he rejected her and carried his day back home and told his dad what happened at school. the dad's son sawed his younger brother who is one year younger than him but he sawed him crying so he ask him what had happen at school and the brother told him.

So the brother told his younger brother that his girlfriend just broke up with him and said that the girl that ask you out was my girlfriend. None of this would have happened if you staid in your grade and stayed of moving up two grades and almost taking my girlfriend. The younger brother told that he said no to her and wanted a other girl but not her because he knew that his younger brother was dating her for the past few years. Three years later the brothers are in the same school but different grade the older brother is now one grade above than the younger brother and the younger brother got the girl he had a crush on.

when the two brothers got really old and they had to use wheel chairs to get where their going the brothers still had their girlfriends. But the younger brother got married and the other brother did't because his girl died in a hospital from smoking. Then the older brother died from a car crash by a drunk driver on the interstate and is younger and only brother was very sad when he died so now he is the only boy left in the family besies the dad and uncle oh and the grandpa died to because of age. The young son lived in till he got the age of 56 and his wife died at the age of 54 very sad time at lest they are in one big grave with rest of the family.",1,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
BE68B9E53CCB,"I believe that when people ask for advice they should talk to multiple people because they will all have different ideas and experiences. I will touch on these two main points and give examples using books and other useful pieces of information.

You can benefit from others ideas because they might have solved whatever problem you are facing in a different way. One example of this is from the book

Ranger's Apprentice: Siege of Maldor . I might have the title wrong. Anyway in the book the protagonist Will is in a forest surrounding a fortress. He is with a friend of his, Malacose. The name might be wrong as well. One of his other friends has been captured and been taken to the fortress. So then Will and Malacose worked together to come up with a way to save his friend. Will came up with the a plan to take the fortress. He used Malacose's idea to use small explosions and other nonlethal props and sound devices to distract the enemy so Will and another of his friends Horace could slip into the castle mostly unnoticed. Then once they had secured a foothold. Then they unleashed more of Will's friends, Skandians to help them take the fortress.. Another example is from the book Ranger's Apprentice Battle for Skandia. In this book the Skandians are being invaded by an army that has never lost a battle. So the Skandians go to Halt and Will for help. Actually it was Halt and Will who told them that the Temuji were coming. Anyway Halt had experience with the Temuji so he came up with a plan that was very unskandian like. But the Skandians agreed to it because it was their only hope. The Temuji were horse people so their ideal battlefield was on an open plain. Also one of their favorite tactics was to fake a retreat to draw out the enemy but then to cut them down with a ambush. That then would draw out more of whoever they were facing and repeat the process. So Halt used that agent them and staged a ambush for their ambush. Short version the Skandians used Halt's ideas even though it was not something they would normally do and came out victories.

This is why I believe that you can learn a lot from someone else's experiences to help you. My first example is from the book

Ranger's Apprentice: Ruins of Gorlan . I think this title is correct. We are still with Will. So he, his teacher Halt, a Baron and a Battle master are at the ruins of Gorlan. Halt and the Baron are wounded and the Battle master is petrified with fear. They are all this way because of a creature. I forget what it's called so, yeah. the beast is about to kill the three when Will who is standing a ways off recalls a lesson Halt taught him. The beast's fur was highly flammable. So he lit his arrow on fire and shot the beast. Thus saving the three and killing off the last of those creatures. My second example is also from the Ranger's Apprentice series.

Rangers Apprentice Battle of Nejon Ja ,

or something that sounds like that but is not spelled that way. So Will and Horace are in Nejon Ja and are in a run down fortress and are expecting to be attacked at the end of the Winter because the enemy cannot get to them because they way is blocked by snow and ice. All they have are some untrained natives to protect themselves and the emperor whose warlords turned against him because he was working to raise the natives who were with him at that moment to have greater rights. Then Will remembers a training and fighting style that was easy to master and was based on working as a unit not as a individual, which is the way the enemy fought. So Will used his past experience to help them train the natives quickly and helped them win. That was why I believe it is beneficial to use your past experience which leads me to the conclusion.

To sum things up Will and the Skandians used others advice also known as ideas and were victorious and Will used things he had learned to outsmart his opponents. This is why I believe you should always listen to others advice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
C10C76A6A14D,"If I'm making a really important decision I like to ask a wide variety of people what they think. Most of the time it consist of a close friend, an adult, and maybe my younger sibling. Normally, I already have a decision I'm leaning toward, but I like to find what others think in case I'm missing something. They might be thinking of something I haven't thought of yet or an option that wasn't apparent to me. I think seeking opinions from multiple different people can be very beneficial because it gives you a different point of view, helps you get opinions from people with more life experience, and helps you come to a more well rounded decision.

When you ask for the opinions of others it can help you understand different points of view in your situation. Not just where you're coming from, but how others involved in the situation might see things. That can be extremely helpful to make sure your not hurting anyone or looking over a vital piece by making your decision. Also, other people have different thought processes, so they might think of an option that you haven't yet. This gives you an entirely different way of thinking about things. Talking to different people adds sparks of creativity to your decision, and opens your mind to understand that things might not have to be black and white.

Talking to all these different people gives you an opportunity to talk to people of different age groups who have more life experience then you. Asking people younger than you helps you because they have a open and free flowing mind. They might give you the simplest answer that never crossed your mind. Talking to your peers about things is also helpful. They understand how your peers react with one another, so he/she can help you get a prospective close to something another peer would say. Reaching out to your elders I find to be the most important. They have a lot more life experience then you, and there is a possibility that they have gone through something similar. They can give a lot of important advice just from their past experiences and things they have done growing up. Plus, sense what happened is in the past they already know the outcome of their decision, so they can share it with you to pass on what they either did right or wrong. This way either kind of advice in beneficial, if they found they did something wrong you know to stay away from that option, and if they found they did something right you know to consider it.

All of these different types of advice and thought processes really help to make a well rounded and thought out decision. Once you have talked to many different types of people and received their opinions you can weigh out your options. Pooling together all the angles of the situation to find out what you have to do, and to make a decision that is best for yourself. I think that even though sometimes having everyone give you advice can be other whelming, it really helps you to look at your situation in different ways and find all of your options. All of these things are really helpful to come to a decision you feel strong about and you know is right.

In conclusion, I believe taking into account multiple opinions is very important. If you ask different people you'll end up getting all different views on the topic, which you might not have thought of. Also, by asking others, it gives you an opportunity to get opinions from people that have more life experience then you, and people that might have gone through the same thing your going through. Lastly, all their input along with your personal preferences can help you form a well rounded and though out decision. I think seeking opinions from others is vital to having an open mind and seeing all the possibilities.  ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
B939C9FDDAB0,"Finding a wise person for advice can be challenging, everyone needs advice sometimes, but taking it from the wrong people can be punishing. Many people can share their experiences with you, along with offering a good path to follow. Listening to a person's advice is helpful, however, you should try and formulate different opinions to make a custom one. Hearing similar situations leads to many rewarding outcomes: practice for the future, formulating your own opinion, and learning experiences.

Once you have found the best way to help your situation, you can apply this to future problems. Being able to fix current issues with past solutions makes you trust yourself more. Having more of this practice and different outcomes will make things easier each day. For example, you left your homework on the table and now you can't turn it in. Your mother and friend provide you with advice; your mother suggested you keep all homework in a folder, and your friend says you should just do your homework before class. You should depend on the reliable advice that you know will work. Your homework might be a long packet, which is better to do at home and put in a folder. Having this advice will help you keep up with your homework for a long time.

When getting advice from multiple people, it may not be exactly what you're looking for or be too confusing. You don't always have to follow what people tell you to do; instead you can combine them into a personal solution. This is a good way to fit into what you're comfortable with. You should not have to do exactly what someone else does, however, you can make an improvised solution from their actions. You can stretch out your bubble, and stay inside it at the same time. It is very comforting to know you can be independent and form a personal solution.

When making a choice, there are rewards and consequences. Mistakes are not always horrible, you can learn from them as well. Applying these mistakes and learning experiences will help you make better choices. A more positive outlook on your mistakes is seeing them as a gift. The gift of wisdom is a good thing, and knowledge is gained with it. As long as you don't revert back to the bad habits and choices, you grow strong mentally.

Overall, having different opinions and hearing many different experiences is good. Having dependable sources make you grow as a person gaining lessons, practice for future issues, along with custom solutions.                 ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
E55640B069F5,"Imagine your trying to decide on a hair color, Red, Green, Blue or Black? You have no idea. This is why sometimes you need multiple opinions on what to do. So you go around you ask friends their responses are all different you dont know what to do. So you have to find a another person to help you out.

Dying your hair a different color is not an easy task, you need to decide from the hundreds of shades and colors they have for you to use. Between simple colors like Blue, Red, Blue and Black. You need multiple people to ask what color you should get but, what if those people all choose different colors for you to use. This is why you need multiple opinions.

But guess what that person says the color you dont want to do. What do you do? Get more opinions or just give up? You keep going, you wanted to dye your hair in the first place so you need to figure out what your gonna do. You're gonna narrow down your list to less and ask 5 people again what color should I dye my hair?

After getting multiple opinions you are going to get your hair the color blue. Most of your friends said you should get it blue. They helped you settle what color you should dye your hair.

In conclusion, Getting multiple opinions is the way to go. Whether deciding where to eat where to go or what color your hair should be. Some of these are very hard choices and people should ask for multiple opinions not just one.                ",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
9D449BEA0CA6,"One thing that can never happen is asking to many questions, because question are away of making sure the answer is right or if the answer is not clear. I also think that asking more than one person is a great thing, because seeking multiple opinions can help make better choices, make sure all the facts are right, or if someone is wrong about something.

The way seeking multiple opinions and help you make better choices is by one person my say all these good thing about one collage and another person might tell say the complete opposite of that. Even if that wasn't enough to make the decision which collage to go to it would never hurt to get a third opinion. It can also be at a job that may not be the best but just by getting someone else say in that job it could possibly change anyone point of view on that job and it could help them make their decision easier. Adults and young adults may need help by picking a new car out, because car are really expensive and there is a lot to look at like the gas, how many miles, and the amount the car cost. Those are big things to look at when buying a car and a young adult may not know about all those things so they my just ask their mom, dad, or even their grandparents. With young adults they can make some pretty bad decisions and serious ones to like taking drugs. Many teems think that taking drugs wont effect them or they wont get addicted but before they think about doing drugs they should ask a trusting friend that is a good influence and hear what they have to say.

Another way seeking multiple opinions can be help is when doing a paper and looking at different web sites. When on Wikipedia not all their fact are true, because anyone one can go on there and put whatever they want to. So thats its always good to go to more than one website when researching something. In school not all the teachers think alike clause when asking for help by one teacher they my tell you this is the answer but when going to another teacher they may think other wise but this doesnt always happen because most of the teachers know what their doing.

The last way seeking multiple opinions can also help with small thing like picking out clothes or what bag of chips to get. It may just seem like a bag of chips but when asking one friend to see if the new pringles chips are good or not and they say no but your other friend says they are the best thing in the world. So then when asking your third friend they say they are the best thing to so when trying them they were actually the best thing ever. Its little things like that can make change someones future because now their kids are going to grow up eating those chip and so on.

Those were may reason I thought seeking multiple opinions could be helpful, because it can help make better choices,make sure all the facts are right so your not saying anything false, and for small things in life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

I know that some of my friends need advice for something like guitars or some thing like that. Everyone asks for advice or something like this for example; hey what should we do for our spring break go to the movies or go to water park. This is a good example cause some of us don't know what to do for spring break. We gain confidence from friends and their experience

I know for a fact teenagers always ask for advice about crushes.

D16B647E363E,"Many people ask for advice in their lifetime. When it comes to asking for advice it could lead you to success or even failure. When people ask for advice they could get the right or even the wrong answer. Advice is not just a simple thing most people ask because they are clueless on what to do. It is a good idea to ask multiple people for advice in ways like it gives you more than one way on how to do something, someone might have a better opinion, and one person could have better experience on the topic you are talking about.

One of the reasons that seeking multiple opinions can help someone is by having more than one right way on how to do something. By having more options open it can help someone handle the decision better from just having one idea. In order to having many ideas you would need to ask people around you for their opinion. With having more than one way on how to do something it can be good in anything you do. Most people like having multiple ideas on a topic because it helps them figure it out better. When people give you more than one way you dont always have to take the more reasonable advice, take the one that you think will help you at the end of the day. In the end having more options to choose from can lead you to success and to making the right decision.

Although, having more options to choose from is better, someone might have a better opinion to give to you. With someone having a better opinion they could affect the decision in more ways than one. For instance, if your best friend has one idea but another peer has a better approach you would go with the idea that works the best. Sometimes in life the people you that think will have the best advice might not have advice for you at all, so you would have to make the choice yourself or find somebody that you normally wouldnt ask for advice. After all having better opinions on things can help you out more ways than you could imagine.

Another way how asking multiple people for advice can help you make a better decision is that someone might have past experience with the situation. Asking someone that has experience with it can help you make a better and quicker choice than from someone who does not have the experience. People with experience often help those in need of their advice. For example if you ask your parents for advice and they dont know what to tell you, you could ask other family members that would know exactly what to say. Giving advice is sometimes like cheating on a test, it could help you out deeply or it could turn around and hurt you. Always ask someone who has experience with the situation rather than from someone who does not because it could help you out in the long run.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is a good thing to do. Trying new ways to ask for advice can most likely always help you find the advice you really need. As showed asking multiple people for advice is good because it gives you more than one way for something, someone might have a better opinion, and someone could have more experience. Good advice has helped people over the years in different ways and it continues to do so.

Most of all asking someone for advice is a key to when you are trying to make a big decision.    ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
58647D4AF653,"I think that seeking opinions for multiple people is a good idea ,for its kind of that voting if most of the people that you've ask says the same thing it must or most likely true, Another reason I think it a good idea is because it can help you get out of a bad relationship, My Last reason i think asking multiple people for there opinion is it is voting because some people loves there country and wants the best for it some people don't (people that vote for Donald Trump). So really it can be good and bad.

Have you ever just didn't know what to wear and then you ask people on the phone, your mom, your dad, your granny, and even your favorite uncle, and then half of them say wear the left one then to say wear the right one which one would you pick?.... THE LEFT ONE RIGHT . See asking people to help is fun (well at least to me).Did you see this thing on instagram where you can put 2 or more oppsions and then te people that view it can vote then which ever oppsion has the most vote you have to do it its pretty fun if you ask me (mostly youtubers do that). Sometimes doin that it is bad take me for example I had this friend named Generic_Name and I asked her whether I should wear the dark blue jeans or the light blue jeans she said the light ones then I came to school with the light jeans and I had a bottom locker so I got on my knees so I can open my like and then someone must have spilled some coffee and my pant where covered in coffe and Generic_Name starting laughing and it wasn't funny and that mde me mad thats when my mom told me not to trust nobody but the man above.

By the way that last paragraph was my first reason anyways my second reason i think asking people for help ,for it can help you get out of a bad relationship becacuse it can be abuse, no love in the reltionship, and one of them could be cheating. You never know it can be very hard for a person to get out of a bad relationship. That why when you watch a terrible relationship move most of them ask there mom for advice or the friends oe who ever they be talking to and by the end they're are out the the realstionship.

My very last reason I think asking for advice from multiple people is a good thing, for its just like voting. In this paragragh im going to be talking about how its bad and good. Sometimes voting can be bad or good becasue we never know what type of president we'll really get so it is bad but sometimes good. When peopl vote the can vote for a bad pesident (Trump) or a good president (Obama). Just like what i said in paragragh one whne ou get more votes there is a president when you get less ther not the president. I never heard of a president geting a tie though.

In conclusion asking for advice from multiple people can be good or bad you never know. Also it can be very hard to choose bewteen because you can' pick both in this world. One more thing you can't trust just everybody. Good can be simple things and bad can be simple things. I meant to put this in the relationship paragraph but the about asking for advice from a terrible relatioship is when you tell you friend or even you own mother can say just stick around it will get better just be a good wife or husband.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
B934F3106FCB,"When people ask for advice they automatically just trust the opinion of others but also ask many others for their opinions and here is why...

People will trust an indavujal but not trust their opinion, Because the little part of you disagrees and that is natural you are two totally different people. You will go to others to weigh out their opinion and see which one is better you could get two opinions one person is foolish lets say you just asked them first. The other person is wise will you follow the first opinion or go seek out another. Which will be a wise opinion from a wise person or a opinion from a foolish person. However everyone wants a wise persons advice but what if that foolish person. Has a wiser moment in that opinion than the wise one, you will never know when one is truly wise unless. You take the time to see for yourself The foolish one may be the wiser one does not matter their intelligence the only thing that. Really matters is their opinion and the reason behind it so seek out both opinions and truly see which opinion fits the description of what your looking for in an answer. For example, if you only take one opinion than you wont have anything weigh out in the end. You dont only have to seek out only two you can do as many as you like just write them own and see which was is the best way to go.",2,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
BF01FFEF8CB3,"When you ask for advice, you ask multiple people right? I do. One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. Another reason why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is that when you ask different people for advice they would give you their own opinions about that choice. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it. For example, if you ask a friend to tell you if you should do your homework or not that friend might say ""No dont do your homework and lets hang out"" ,in the other hand, if you ask your other friend if you should do your homework or not he might say ""Yes do your homework because if you dont you might get a bad grade"", and then you would have to pick which one is better for you.

8A00BBFCFABB,"Why is it better to get advice from multiple people to help someone make a better choice? It's important to get multiple opinions from anyone because you can have more open options and have a idea on what would be better for you in the future and you wouldn't feel helpless and depressed no matter what the situation your in.

Most importantly, when you have more options your most likely to wait and observe all those options and see which one would fit your needs the best. When getting advice from someone you would probably play it out in your head and ask yourself, is this the best choice for me? Asking yourself what option would positively help the outcome of my situation. In that case your gonna need/want multiple advice from different people. Then, you would want to think how that might effect your future in the long run. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen between you or someone just because it helped you in the end. Try and solve the problem by understanding yourself and that other person,like you would want good outcomes for both of you and for no one to be hurt. After,your gonna want to know that that was the best choice for you so that the situation was completely resolved. It might effect somethings good or bad. But in that way you would learn from it and know that maybe that certain option wasn't the best to fit your needs. Open and multiple opinions are always gonna be better than having one because there will always be a better chance of having a problem figured out.

Additionally, asking for advice won't make you feel helpless or depressed. Most people these days suffer from depression because they think they don't have anyone to turn to and nothing is gonna help them in anything they're caught up in. Opening up and talking to people can re leave that feeling. Asking people for help and advice on what to do. First,asking others for options would make the situation less stressful and you wouldn't have to feel alone. Sometimes when you do have more than two or three ideas, those ideas can surprisingly make a better impact on the situation. You have better ways to see the outcome because of that opinion you followed through with. All together,the situation can be resolved or it won't have to be a big deal like it was before that made you feel uncertain. All those opinions and advice you took can make your life so much easier and make you feel less worried. Taking the advice,using it, and letting it help you and the situation can take off any negative energy you felt towards yourself. You can be unbothered and be happy that you no longer have to take care or think of what you had to go through . So basically letting other people help you and your needs can take off so much stress off you shoulders and you wouldn't have that feeling of being empty all the time because you have no idea on what to do or if anything can help at all.

So because asking people for multiple opinions and seeing how it can effect your future and feeling less stressed or depressed, there will always be a better chance for you to make a better choice and have almost anything solved.

A868395AEAAB,"Have you ever wondered why people seek for other peoples opinions, well this paper will explain the reason behind it. This paper will also go through the logic behind it and three reasons people do it so often. The reason people look for other's opinions is because it gives people a new perspective, allows them to compare choices and gives them a good idea of what the choice or answer is.

The first and most common reason people seek other people's opinions is they just want a new perspective. There is a lot of people who want a new perspective because they want somthing fresh or they want to understand the other side. Most people have learned that ""Asumption is the mother of all failures."" and for that reason people seek other peoples opinions so they make the best choice with the info they have. Because if you do not know the reasons or do not understand the other side or answer, it can lead you down a path of failure or leave you with the wrong answer. This is why people seek for a new perspective/opinion.

The next reason people seek out other's opinions is they want something to compare their answer or another answer to. Comparing answers and opinions can give you insight on a topic or idea and give you a sence of whats wrong and whats right. Because say you have one opinion/answer and compare them, you can see what matches the other in both answers and from that can decide what is the best choice. Most people like to list the pros and cons out and compare and do stuff like that and it does help and it easy to do. This is why people seek for opinions to compare.

The final reason is just to have a better understaning and a good idea of what is right. Because most people seek for those opinions on the though of getting a better understanding or just understanding it in the first place. Because if they understand a topic better their more likely to pick a better choice or answer on that topic. What was stated in the first paragragh also comes in here, people always are looking fo a new way to look at things and look at things from multiple angles. Looking at thing fron different ways and perspectives can give you and idea of the right choice or just straight out tell you.

In conclusion, getting new perspectives, comparing opinions and getting good idea of whats right. These are the reasons people seek out other opinions and answers, but these are just some of them. So when you don't know the right choice or answer, it never bad to ask someone.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Decision and choices are things we all have to make, but why can't they be easier? Asking one's opinion on something can shine a light on something that was once not thought of, they can also persuade you to a decision that they see fit, and if you ask multiple people, you can find the popular opinion.

Starting off, shedding light on a new topic can be helpful because if you have never thought about this option, then it could help you come to a final verdict. Second, this thing that has been brought up, may show you why picking one of the choices could negatively impact you. It can also show you a different way of thinking. This thing can provide to you why something is a better choice than the other.

Next, if someone can persuade you to an option, it can make the choice seem easier, as if it's not all on you. Now, when someone tries persuades you, they try to give you the option they think is right, and if you trust them and believe in them, they can lead you down the right path. If you believe in that persons choice, then it could make them think that you really trust them.

My last reason, if you find several peoples opinion on one thing, you can find the popular opinion. Finding the popular opinion can show you what ever one thinks is a better choice. It can show you that you are making the right choice. The popular opinion of all these people can also show you why the choice you were making is wrong. If you chose the popular opinion, then it makes you feel confident that you have made the right choice.

In conclusion, I think it is better to have multiple peoples opinions because it can show you something new, they can help you come to a decision, and they can show you the popular opinion.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
1DD5B206DC55,"When you make a decision without advice, you are trusting that you have enough background knowledge to make a wise choice. When you ask more than one person for advice you are expanding your knowledge so you can make a better choice. The more people you ask, the more knowledge you have of a situation. Everyone has some advice to give, it might even be worth your while to find out what that is. Just remember to check for bias when asking multiple people.

As an example, you go to the store to buy your favorite product, but someone tells you it is cheaper at another store. You can make the best choice by asking someone else what they think, this saves time when you find out that it is not cheaper. When listening to someone else's advice make sure you listen for bias. If that person who told you it was cheaper here than at the other store, then they might have been bias against the other store. They would lie to you so you would avoid the other store.

Every person sees from a different set of eyes, we all have a different view for every situation. When asking for advice you should always consult more than one person. If they have some different insight to a situation, they will share that knowledge with you, helping you make better choices. Those choices could help you reach your goals or even reach the stars",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
34CC756C2707,"When people ask for advise they often ask more then one person so they can get the best advise possible.

I think that people should ask multiple people for advise because they feel that different people will have different ideas about something, so if they ask multiple people they get good advise that is not flawed.

Some examples of people asking for advise from Several people are, when I wanted to get a new fishing rod one of the workers said that the one I was looking at was very durable, but then I looked up the reviews of the product online and people said that It broke within a month of them getting it. Another example is when my brother and I wanted to get a new shiftier for our racing simulator, we looked at a video of someone who bought one that we were looking and they said that they did not like it and that it was poorly made. After we watched that video we looked at some other videos on it and they said that it was one of the best ones you could buy for a reasonable price. One final example of why you should always ask multiple people for advise is when my family and I went to a karting shop to get some new parts that had worn on our karts, when we got there we knew exactly which ones were good and bad because we asked people at the racetrack for advise on which parts we should get, most of them agreed on what parts we should and should not get.

Some details of why you should get more than one persons opinion are that some people are bias with their opinion, for example one person might think that one thing is better to do just because that is what they do even though it may not be the best thing to do. Also some people may not have good advise for you if they never had to do something similar or they just dont know what you are asking them about. One more thing is that one person might just give you bad advise even if they dont mean to, so asking for lots of peoples opinions would be good so you have a higher chance of getting good advise.

I believe that you should ask for multiple pieces of advise so you get the best advise possible.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
608A0F691705,"Have you ever asked your friends and family for their opinions? When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Advice is very bias but can help in many situations. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. It allows them to see the differences and similarities in the advice given from multiple people, hear many different ways to solve the problem, and one persons advice may not be the way hey want to handle the situation.

To begin with, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows them to see the differences and similarities in the the advice given. For example, you ask your friend for advice about you and your spouse. Your friend tells you to try and talk with your lover about it. Then, you ask your mother and her opinion is the same as your friends. This shows the similarities in the opinion and it seems not to be as bias. There also can be differences in advice. Say the same situation happens but instead your mother tells you to ignore the person. You now have two ways to respond to the problem.

Second, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it allows you to hear many different point of views. Hearing many different ways to solve a problem allows you to choose what you think is best. For example, your dog runs away and you dont know what you should do. Your best friend, mother, father, and sister all give you different opinions on how they would find your dog. At first, you wanted to go look for the dog on the streets like your sister said but instead you use your best friends advice which is to put posters all around town. Different opinions can keep you safe while also fixing the problem.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can help someone maker a better choice because one persons opinion may not be the way you want to handle the situation. Opinions are someones personal beliefs and you may not agree with what they tell you. Asking many people gives you a better perspective of ways to handle the problem. For example, a girl is talking about you in school. All of your friends say you should fight her, but your mother says it's just a waste of time and to not worry about it. If you were to only ask your friends for their opinion you may have been suspended from school. This is why asking more than one person is very helpful!

Seeing the differences and similarities in the advice given from multiple people, hearing many different ways to solve the problem, and one persons advice may not be the way hey want to handle the situation are all reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Opinions help you solve everyday problems that you may not even think about. Opinions can also keep you safe and out of trouble. Sometimes you many not agree with the opinion while other times you will. Asking many people for their opinion will allow you to make better choices throughout your whole life.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
9B1A7C9A90C5,"when asking for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person. multiple opinions make you have a better choice because if you ask one person you don't know if the person advice might get work or not. that's why seeking multiple advises are good, for example asking a bunch of friends for advice can help you decide which one would work out for you you can also vote on which advice is better, but you don't want a bad advice and and if you think that the advice is bad then ask other people if that advice is good or that and if not then ask for advice and keep asking other people. Another example why seeking advice is a good thing is because multiple advice helps you decide what is for the better and not a bad thing if theres something bad about that advice ask someone else what they think about that advice. Lastly seeking for one example is bad because if you go along an advice and don't do so well after you won't want another person to give advice instead you ask multiple people and they tell you something different and you agree with it and you plan what would happened if you do this and that. One important thing about asking for advice ask advice to the people you trust not the other way because they might give you a bad advice and embarrass you and you don't want that. This are my reason why seeking multiple advice are good and what not to do. an example of asking for good advice is imagine I have to retake a test and I ask a bunch of friends what to do. some people are going to tell me to cheat and others are going others tell me to study I would think about each advice and see if I study would I pass and not get in trouble or cheat and if I get in trouble I have to take responsibility.

14EA20764FD8,"Sometimes, when people ask more than one person for advice they try to see what to do to help them . And seeking multiple opinions can help because, when a person dont know what to do they need somebody to help them , guide them, and show them the right way. and taking advice from from muliple people just might help them beacuse what if the advice you took from Generic_Name might be better than Generic_Name., because Generic_Name ,might told you exactally what to do , how to do it, when to do it but, Generic_Name just told you to keep your head up and wait the right time..taking advice from more than one person can be a good thing , some people need muliple people to talk to to get where they need to get. making better choices sometimes u cant do it by yourself.. everybody needs that one person to help them and guide them but you never know who might tell you to do the right thing. some people just wanna know whats going on with you and really ain't trying to help better yourself or make the right choice so its only right to feel ok to get advice from more than one person , and really it dont even have to be a whole lot of people, one,two or maybe three got enough. beacuse i know how it felt to be alone.

And, another thing when a person asking for advice they sometimes lost,confused,going thru something or even worst and need people to just help them, one person help but i really feel that having Atleast two people you can run to to help you or give you goof advice beacusee, what if that one persom you ONLY talk to busy , working , having family time and cant talk right now or help you make a good choice that why its always good to to have muliple people u trust around to help u at all times. thats the most best feeling ever knowing u have somebody you can trust with your persona stuff or even what u have in mind to do..without everybodying knowing before u tell them.

Third, Hepling others always been ok and a good thing so when people ask me for advice i always be ok with it . if anybody even needed a hug i don't be caring cause helping others is OK. caring and giving your time is always been ok and being there for a person always been ok. you never know when you might need somebody or need advice from somebody. so always be nice ad never rude to somebody cause you never know when its your time and u might need somebody to talk to, vent too, need adive from or a shoulder to cry on. respect them love them n tell them whats the right thing to do. when you help people good things come your way. like once again ain't NOTHING wrong with helping eachers and giving out the best advice.. it should make u feel good and happy at yourself for helping out others and there problems.

Trust, Trust is another thing. if you have trust u dont have anything or you dont need to texting or talking to that person cause trusting somebody u giving all your business too or wanted help from them .,and for them to know everything is important..learn people, buld a bond,get to know well ! because, its NOT ok for you to be friends or anything with a person u cant trust. you need to watch and learn evrybody to talk to, think before to tell people u business..and even if you and that person fall out you shouldn't haven to worry about them telling everuthing yall talked about to next person, the trust gone remain soild and everything gonna be fine. but if you dont have trust and yall fall out and they tell everything you gonnna have trust issues amd its gonr make it hard fro you to ask anybody for advice . because, of that main situation..

Commuication, when talking to somebody having a serioud talk always have good commuication with them cause if you texting them dry, late and constanly saying the bsame thing over i really feel like that's disrespectful . because if that person feeling comfortable to tell you whats going on with them and you not playing attention, on your phone,taking long to text back, etc. i will feel a certain way, so when giving advice to someone give them all your attention and tell them whats right. give them all you ! the honest truth on how u feell and what they shoukd do to help they situation get better and you gotta also help them . with anything, cant let that person down.

Teamwork,always be there for that person no matter what. help them with whatever they need to you. stay on there side always. lead them in the right direction..if even going out on dates , having date nights at home, being on the phone for hours help. be there for them everybody neds somebody they can always run too no matter how many days they went without talking , no matter how manys days they went without seening that person.. no matter whatt. teamwork is good and good for there friendship, bring joy into that person life , try help healing. help them make good choices help them to do good in life. help with anything they need. ain't nothing like a health frienship bond. knowing u have somebody that give good advice and help u make good choices. respect each ,other love each other and never give up on each other! ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
94BD9432CA7C,"Looking for multiple opinions can help someone make a good choice because it allows different ideas, help, trust, and inspiration to be available to the seeking individual.

A good reason to why seeking the advice of others is beneficial is that asking others can help give multiple viewpoints on a situation. Looking for advice in more than one person drives the seeker to open their mind and changes their own opinions. Generic_Name was facing a problem at school with her classmates. She didn't know what to do about another girl who was bullying her. She decided to confide in her mother, a friend, and a counselor for advice. Her mother had experience in this from her years as a student, and she gave her opinion to Generic_Name to talk to the bully. Her friend said that the bully was really just hurt and lonely and took it out on Generic_Name. When Generic_Name talked to the counselor, he had extensive knowledge in this area and was able to guide Generic_Name through the steps of overcoming the problems faced, and through becoming friends with her bully. By Generic_Name's seeking to find a rational choice, she found multiple viewpoints that had insight and experience in them. Furthermore, she not only was able to stop the bullying, but she was able to become friends with the girl who had once been her enemy. While receiving other viewpoints can help, those same viewpoints can lead to new thoughts and ideas that greatly enhance the ability to make a good choice.

Seeking the opinions and advice of others either inside or outside the situation fosters inspiration.

Learning from what others say is a important skill, and basing new ideas off of other ones is a complex and great way to make an informed decision. I ask my father for help on my math homework very often. When doing hard, creative thinking problems that sometimes require more knowledge than I have, my father is there to teach me. One time, I was struggling on an especially difficult problem when I asked for advice on how to complete it. My father studied the problem for nearly 20 minutes before talking. When he finally spoke, he sounded just as confused as I was. We talked through the question, rebounding ideas off of each other. We tried the strangest ways to solve the math dilemma, but to no avail. After a random thought my dad spit out, we both suddenly fell silent and let the sentence hang in the air. A light, or to be more accurate, an explosion went off in my head, and then I was scribbling as fast as I could on a piece of paper.

""You're a genius, dad! If we do this and take that..."" My mouth could not catch up to the inspiration that had lit my brain on fire. I was finally able to finish the math problem using my own way that was based off of my father's idea,

Not only does asking for help allow ideas from others to inspire your own thoughts and solutions, it brings people together.

The last explanation to why multiple advice is essential is that opinions draws others to the individual asking and creates bonds of trust. When advice is given and taken, the two people participating in the transaction now have a bond of help. Also, when asking for advice about something that needs more executive, outside, professional help, it's more likely to be gotten when you open up to others and seek those opinions. A problem that no one knows about cannot be aided if the person in need never asks for help. I have a close friend who was recently struggling with something. Generic_Name was experiencing deep bouts of depression and was scared and unsure of what to do with his feelings. He came to me and another friend, Generic_Name, seeking our opinions. We were very grateful that he had decided to tell us about his feelings, and we told him that he would need professional help, like that from a counselor, therapist, or doctor. After supporting him in telling a school counselor, he was able to begin therapy and start on the track of getting better. Ever since he came to us with the trust to ask for our advice, we have been closer than ever. Our bond as friends has been strengthened when caring for him. We immediately came to his aid when he asked, and finally brought him to outside help. With the bonds created by advice asking and giving, anyone can overcome a difficult obstacle.

When facing a situation that needs a solution or some kind of action from an individual, that individual should almost always look to others for more viewpoints, inspiration, and support. There is always a way to gain wisdom and help from others, and using that wisdom and aid to make the best choice available is beneficial to them and those around them.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
4A81C9528150,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because different views can open your eyes to a problem. If you're having a fight with your friend, multiple opinions will help because you can see the argument from their point and try to understand what they are feeling. Multiple opinions can also help you make a strong decision based on if you agree or disagree with what the opinions say.

I was in a horrible argument with one of my friends. When we were fighting I searched for multiple opinions and it helped me make the right decision. After I talked to my mom and dad about what was happening they helped me realize that the girl was never a good friend to me and that I deserve a real friend.

Different views help with more than just arguments; they can help with forming your own opinion too. Last year I took civics class and I didn't fully have an opinion formed on politics. I started watching the news and political debates and I formed my own opinions on current issues. If I had only watched one news program or only listened to one person's campaign then I wouldn't have known that there was a different way to see things and I would have never formed a good opinion.

Whenever seeking advise you should always look for a variety opinions because someone could be wiser and already have lived through what you're going through. My mom has always been there for me whenever I need help and I hope that I can be there for her when she needs multiple opinions. She has always been very wise beyond her years and I love her for it because she helps me so much everyday.

Talking about problems with many people will help you learn multiple views on the matter at hand. It is important to remember your own opinion but also listen to others so you can form a wiser opinion. When making life changing decisions you have to remember to ask for help and truly listen to what they are saying because and outside voice could help you see the bigger picture.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

People like to get different opinions from different people so, they know what to do. When people talk to more than one person they are more likely to make a better choice. They can also see if the person they have asked have almost the same advice as the other person and do what they told them to do.

Also people like talk to more than one person because they want to hear what they think. If they see that the opinions that everyone is giving them are similar, they are most likely to make the choice they have heard. People also make a better choice by doing what they hear the most. This way they know what do to because they heard different opinions from different people.

When people also ask for advice they sometimes only talk to only one person. They talk to only one person for advice because they might not trust other people. If they only talk to one person for advice, they might not always do what that person told them because it is probably not the advice they were looking for. But many people go to more people for advice because they want to see what everyone thinks and they want different opinions.

9D29B2E438C8,"When was the last time you asked for advice? When in such a situation, it is important to ask more than one person. If you just went to one person, you could end up getting really bad advice. Asking lots of people will allow you to evaluate multiple opinions. It also gives you control over the decision you are making, as you ultimately decide which of the options to choose. You can also come up with your own solution based off of the solutions of others. Asking multiple people allows for the freedom of choice and, consequently, a better choice.

However, when only asking one person, you may end up with bad advice. For example, when I was little, I asked my older brother for help on my homework. I assumed that since he had been through the class, he knew exactly what he was doing. Instead, he had forgotten how to do it, and mislead me. If I had asked my mom and dad, then I would have been able to reason that if they both got the same answer, they were right. My trust in one person's advice led me to get a C on my homework, and a break in my otherwise straight As.

Though only asking one person can lead to bad advice, there are times when the advice given is good. This is especially true if you ask someone you can trust. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the advice given still may not be the best, and to get the best advice possible, you will have to consult multiple people. Currently, I am scheduling classes for high school, and have talked with my mom about it. She has helped me arrange things so that I can meet all the requirements while still taking the classes I want to take. While I trust her and know that the advice she has given me is good, I plan on visiting the school counselor to make sure that everything works, and to get more advice. I know the school counselor will have better advice because she knows the most about planning for high school. It is crucial that I listen to her if I want the best advice.

Using these methods will usually get you good advice, but it requires blind trust in someone else's advice to get you precisely what you want. Good advice should make you think about what you want to do instead of telling you how to do it. By evaluating the advice given to you, you can find the parts that make the most sense to you and formulate your own idea based on them. When I finalize my plan for high school, I will use both my mom's advice, the counselor's advice, and my own idea of what I want to do to create the best plan. Using other people's advice in conjunction with mine will give me a plan that helps me accomplish exactly what I want.

There are many ways to find and use advice. No matter how you do it, the end result should reflect your wants and needs. Asking many people is the best way of doing this, because it allows you to choose what you know is best for you, and not just what one person may think. This leads to independent decisions that put you on a path to becoming the person that you want to be. Clearly, when looking for advice, consulting many people is an important start.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

They let power go to their head and stop asking advisers and mentors. People must never get overconfident. You should always ask multiple people for advise before making a decision because you get different points of view.

People have different opinions and views. People seek advise when they are confused and maybe even scared. These pieces of advice can change peoples decisions and thoughts. You can easily be over influenced by one persons opinion. Viewing a problem from multiple angles help you get a clear and easy answer.

If you were to buy a car, and you knew nothing about cars, who would you ask? Most people ask their parents and friends. You can get many outlooks from those people, but you still need a opinion for yourself, so you might research cars and prices. I think you should always have your own thoughts before going to others for help, so you don't get set in one view.

I have done things that were not smart in the sense that I didn't talk to anyone. People say you should only trust yourself, but people are not perfect and they have flaws. People buy things they don't need and won't use. I am guilty of this myself, so I can give no judgment. I know from experience that you need to put a lot of thought into choices even if they seem non important.

Your sister tells you to not do anything about it, saying you will pass anyway, your mother tells you to study the entire night before with little sleep so you have it all crammed in your mind, and your father says to study, get good sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, and believe in yourself. You take your fathers advice and ace the test. But if you didn't get multiple people to give you advice, you would be stuck with your sisters, which really isn't the best guidance ever. I believe seeking multiple opinions on the matter you would like advice on is important because you can hear from other experiences, you can hear from wiser people, and you can compare and find an in-between if you don't like any of the advice you received.

First off, if you ask multiple people for advice, you will receive some from people with different experiences. If you ask for advice on how to fly a plane, asking a pilot with experience would result in a better answer than someone that has never even gone to the airport. The same thing goes for passions and hobbies. They will have enough experience to help you get quality advice. So asking multiple people for advice to get someone with experience is important.

Another point I'd like to make is that some people may be wiser or more well-educated than others. It may come off as rude, but its a good point. Asking a toddler for a good book to read would have a much different outcome than asking your grandfather. This kind of ties in with my ""experience"" point as well, as younger or less wise people may also have less experience. Asking multiple people for advice to get an educated person is also important.

Lastly, what if you do not like any of the advice you received? Well, with multiple points to work off of, you can find a compromise for yourself. This also works if you like all of the advice you've gotten. If you don't like any or if you want it all, you can compare all of the advice you've been told and do the best thing for you. So yes, getting multiple views can help by getting ideas to work off of.

In conclusion, seeking and receiving multiple opinions and advice can be, and is, very important. It is important to find someone with experience. It is important to find someone with wisdom. It is very important to compare answers you've gotten to see which one you like best, or create your own depending on what you like from the advice.

C646479A45F3,"Sometimes when your in a situation and you need help or just need to talk to someone about it, your basically asking for advice. If you find someone who can give you knowledge on that topic it can really help you now and in the long run. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

Going to get advice from someone can help you get different views. If you are talking to your mom about the situation, she'll probably tend to be in the middle or on both side's. That's probably because she want's you to see the other side of things too. Seeing the other side of things can change your perspective and lead you to see more than what you saw before.

The Washington Post says ""2 out of every 3 people end up sticking with the advice their friends, family, teachers give them about the other side. This is because it changes their view of things and makes them realize different things."" Seeking for advice can really change the way you look at things and make you see clearer on one side than the other. You might hear one persons advice and think about the other side of things and what could happen if this.... if that... happens. If you go to 2 or more people it can make your decision easier to make.

If you go to someone who has been through something like it or who has needed the same kind of advice once before, they can share with you wiser advice. Sometimes when your really not sure what to do and you've already gone to a couple of people, find someone who has been through something like it before. Since they've been through it they can tell you why they came to the decision they made. This may help you with the decision making process. Going to a family member, friend, teacher, or coach that's been through it might steer you into a different direction then you may have hoped for, but they can definitely show you where they're coming from.

New York Times explains, ""74% of young adults who go to seek advice from someone who has been through the situation says it helps them see why they chose what they went with. Even though this may not work for all situations, it can certainly help in some ways, even if it's not huge."" This is a way of telling yourself that even if you didn't go with that persons advice, at least you saw it through and got a better look at all of the options closely.

Different ways of handling the situation is big. You could go one or another, but your just not sure.

The Generic_City Newspaper says ""A way to help you decide what to do in a situation is to ask each person you go for different advice. For example ask each person a different question and this way you get different answers, in which gives you different ways to handle the situation."" There can be many different options and sometimes it can be overwhelming, but if you limit how many people you ask and ask them each a different question, than you can focus on those answers instead of a bunch of overloading advice. If you ask 2 or 3 people for advice it will make it easier on you, but of course don't just ask one person because it helps to know all the different opinions.

In the end, I think it is really important that when you are seeking advice, to go to at least more than 2 different people. Even if two of those people give you basically the same answer, at least you went to them because you might not need their advice now, but in the long run their advice could really help. Getting advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice because they could have a totally different point/opinion and they could really help you see all the other options than just yours. They can also help you to see the other side of things and maybe even make you agree with that side, which could change your whole perspective of things. It's really helpful to seek advice from your peers, but I think it's even more helpful to go to more than one person. To see all of your options. You should always go for what you think the right choice is, even if your best friend gave you completely different advice. Next time you need advice, would you go to someone who can help you make a better choice, or would you go to someone who can give you the advice you're really looking for?                ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Compared to others who ask for others help on a decision so they dont regret it. when people ask for help they get more than one point of view on their decision to make. Also they have that information that others brought up, so the next time they are buying something similar they can think back to that.

I had this old bike where my knees touched the handle bars and the seat would move around on. When I was saving for a new bike I wanted a nice one I saved for a year and a half. I had all that time to ask my parents as well as my friends if a new bike would be a good idea. They convinced me that a new bike would be a good option and i'm happy with it. In other words listening to others may help you get to a decision you were unsure with.

Another reason is in the future when you are saving for another thing . You can use your prior knowledge to help sway your decision. On whether to buy the thing you want or not. I personally used this on my trip in new York when I was buying a gift for my brother. So using prior knowledge form others can help you get to a decision.

while buying things from a rubber ducky to a bike can is fun its always good to check what others think so you dont regret it later. thank you for reading my essay on consulting others before buying something is a good idea.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
7B5F5B33B566,"When people ask for advice , they sometimes talk to more than one person. Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it.

In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if

Abraham

Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios. ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

""Hey there,"" Someone yelled then you relize thats the call of friend that is about to ask for some advice. Many people take advice from others to help with problems they think they can't do by them self. Which leads to the question why take advice from others? They take advice because they don't neccarly need help, but want help to take the easy way out of things. By doing this they second guss them selfs and go and ask more people for more advise to see if the other person advice was wrong, or they have no idea what to do. If that's the case then they take the advice of others to help them with his/her problem by taking the best advice possible, asking how to do what you don't, and knowledge.

Firstly, by taking the best possible advice you would want to go to multiple people for there advice, experince, and help. By going to someone who has already given advice to others they will probably have a lot of imformation for you to have about your issue. If you go to someone with a ton of experince there advice would probaly be the best. Lastly if you go to someone with the experince you have you could give advice to each other, making it good for both of you.

Next, you could ask for tips or pointers on how to give advice to others, learning, and on how to take action. Asking for advice to give other people advice is a great idea if you want to help others out and yourself. By learning you could gain experince like Mrs. Generic_Name to advice to others. Lastly by taking action you take the advice you gain and give it to others.

Finaly, by going to multiple people you gain more knowledge including their perspectives, there reasons on what they would do, and how they would resolve the matter. First by knowing someones perspective you will know on how they would do stuff their own way. Second the reasons on why they would do what they are going to do will help with your actions by putting other reasons together. Lastly by knowing how they would solve the issue it would help to take others solutions all in all.

In conclusion, people who ask others for help are wanting the best advice possible, asking for tips they don't know how to do themselfs, and knowledge. Those who take advice will likely feel better when they actually use the advice to solve there problem and will enjoy it. So don't be afraid to ask for advice from others it will benifit you in the long run.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
94C41739F214,"Seeking multiple opinions can help people make better choices. Talking to more people can boost your understanding of something, help see different points of view, and can boost your trust in someone. When I was in 6th grade I had to write a essay on WWII. I didnt know much so I started asking people about WWII. I found lots of good information from my Grandpa but it wasn't complete, so I went to my dad and he helped fill in the gaps and gave me a second opinion on my topic. Then instead of only writing about the one opinion I chose the better idea and wrote about both, giving may paper more detail.

Seeking multiple opinions can help boost someones understanding of something. One person can only hold so much information, so by getting many opinions you can understand things better because your getting more information. People may know more about a topic than someone else, but by only going to one person they may not give you the information you need and wont help your understanding of that topic. Someone may give you a portion of the information you need, but by getting more you can build them on top of each other to make a better choice. The more and more you hear new opinions the better it can boost you knowledge of that topic.

People have different views on a topic and may know more about one side of an argument than the other. Hearing both sides of an argument can help you write a more in depth essay and a more meaningful one to people on one side of an argument . You can reach out to people because you know why they support or dislike something and try to persuade them to your opinion. By hearing different sides of an argument you can make a better choice because you know both argument and will choose the better one that will help you more.

When you hear many opinions on something it can boost your trust and respect for someone. When you hear the same opinions from different people you can start to trust what they say. When you find out what they say is true then it may build your confidence in them and you may go back to them in the future because you know they have some good knowledge. When you hear the same opinion from a different person it can start to boost your trust in it. When you ask more people for their opinion on the topic and they say the same thing that others have already said. Then you will probably trust that opinion and have more confidence in your choices because you know people agree with you.

Seeking more opinions can help people get advice and use that advice to make a smart choice. When you know more about a topic and understand it you are expected to do the right thing because you know about it. When you hear different sides of an argument you can make a better choice in life because you've not been pushed by one side of an argument, so your not bias. This can help you make a choice that will benefit you because you know the pros of both arguments. Someone will probably make the better choice because they trust all the good information their getting from people. No one says good things about a terrible choice. These are just some of the reasons why seeking multiple opinions from people can help someone make a better choice.    ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
87958B77E2DC,"Have you ever asked someone for advice but still not been sure about your decision? If so you should have tried asking more people. Asking multiple people for advice is a great way to see different sides of an argument. Three reasons to ask for multiple opinions are different views, not a biased outcome and, better reasoning for the final verdict.

The first reason that it is good to get multiple opinions is different views is because people may see the same problem but get a different answer. This then allows you to get more idea of the outcome of the solution that you may not have seen before. It is also good to get different opinions because you may get different views and you still don't have a set answer, you can decide based on the number of people who voted each way.

The second reason is that it is good to get a non-biased answer is so that you don't miss an opportunity because you asked one person who dislikes something that you wanted to do. When you get multiple opinions you set yourself up to get a non-biased opinion so that you are not unfair to one side of an argument. A non-biased opinion is extremely important when it comes to a big decision that could hurt you later on in life so it just a good idea to make sure you see both sides of an argument.

The final reason is that you get a better final decision out of it. The reason for this is because you are putting in more time by asking more people that you really get to think about the problem at hand. This helps because sometimes people end up ruining themselves by rushing headfirst into something without thinking about the consequences that the decision may have. The reason you are asking multiple people in the first place is so that you can get a better final verdict on the topic so you know you aren't making a mistake by doing something.

Three reasons that getting multiple opinions is a good thing are different views, a non-biased answer and, a better final verdict. Which is why I believe that getting multiple opinions is the smart thing to do.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
9D1FEBF9237B,"Have you ever had to make a tough decision before? Most of us have, and the first thing we do is ask for advice. Most of the time it is good to ask multiple people advice and try to get multiple opinions. There are multiple reasons why it is good to get multiple opinions, but the two main reasons are that it reduces bias and it makes the advice more reliable.

Getting multiple opinions helps reduce bias. Bias is a person's opinion towards a certain subject, and it is something we generally try to avoid. Getting multiple opinions can help reduce bias, because when you get multiple opinions you are introduced to new perspectives. Getting multiple perspectives is useful, because it allows you to think about something in multiple different ways and you are more likely to succeed. Another reason it is good to get multiple perspectives is that not everyone agrees with you, so you might receive constructive criticism. Constructive criticism helps improve your ideas and is essential when you are making a tough decision.

Another benefit of getting multiple opinions is that it makes your advice more reliable. This isn't always true, but most of the time, if lot's of people agree with something, it is probably true. One example of this was when I needed help on my homework. One time I was working on an essay for English and I was trying to decide if I needed to put a space between my sentences. First, I asked my mom to see what she thought. Then, I asked my dad to see what he thought. Asking my mom was probably enough but I wanted to make sure everyone agreed with the advice before I used it. I actually got an ""A"" on the essay, so I think the advice worked.

In conclusion, getting multiple opinions is useful when you are trying to get advice. Getting multiple opinions introduces you to new perspectives that are helpful when trying to decide what to do. Getting multiple opinions also makes the advice more reliable, because if more than one person agrees with it, it is more likely to be right. It is probably possible to get good advice with only one opinion, but getting more than one opinion has so many benefits there is no reason not to.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
47228B569E22,"Would you ask more then one person for advice ? If so why would you ? Because on my opinion I think that it would be good to ask other people for their advice on something , because some people could give you different advice , they can help you pick rather or not you should do something , and also you can see who are the people that are willing to help you with some good advice.

Now I would like to talk about why it would be good to get advice from multiple people. I think it is good because I have had a moment when I did not know if I should still be friends with someone I knew had talked behind my back so I started to ask some friend and family members to see what they think about it . Now know they where completely honest with me , so one of my family members told me if what she said hurt me in any type of way then to just stop talking to her. So then I kept asking and they kept giving me different advice , so what I did was I put everything together and it all added up in a way so that is how I got my answer to what I should do. That is why it is good to ask different people for advice because some could give you the same advice and some wont . Now some advice can be good but some are not always good. And it is good to get advice because when you are about to do something you wont have to worry that you are going to do something bad because if the person that you talked to gave you good advice you dont have to worry.

Why is it good to know other peoples opinion? Let me tell you why it is good to know , because if you tell them something then of course they will stop and think then be like you should not do that because you could hurt your self , nor you can hurt the other person. Because then they would tell you why it is a good idea and why it is not. I have been in a situation like that as well where I wanted to do something so i just wanted to make sure that what I was about to do would not hurt any one in any type of way so my cousin started to give me reasons to why I should not do it . I ended up listening to her but then I realized that if I never asked her if it was a good idea I would have made a huge mistake. And that is what I want you to notice that if you are about to do somewhere rather it is to your self or someone else try talking to someone ,and ask them for advice because really it could help. And they can all make sure that you and everyone else are okay. So really knowing other peoples opinion really just a good choice to make because it is helping you.

Now this one is my favorite. Witch is that asking for advice lets you see who are the true friends that are acutely willing to give you advice , and good advice not bad . Because people always have that one friend that is willing to help but not help you in a good way more like in a bad way , because most times let me start of small you ask them a question "" oh does this one look good on me or that one"" and they will answer back with the one they think looks ugly and you know they are picking the ugly one but you just pick not to say anything. Now let me go big if you ask them for advice on something serious they will tell you oh yeah you should do it because it wont harm anyone , but no they just want to put lies in your head so that when people with actual good advice come you will be confused and not know what to do. So it is better to know when a friend is just lying to you because you want a friend that tells you the truth and that you can trust with really anything and you know that their advice wont be bad. Also when you ask any one in particular for advice know that people are not always right so every time you need to make a decision and need advice go with what your head tells you to not always with what other people tell you .

So really that is what I think could help people notice that asking different people for advice is really help full because when you get different ideas from multiple people you have a lot of choices and you get to pick the best one out of all the choices you got but of course you would know rather or not what they told you was good and helpful because if it was not then obviously do not use it. But really my point here is if you ask more then one person for help it can really help you out , because imagine you where going to do something and a part of you is saying dont do it but the other part of you is saying you should do it . Then of course you will need someone to give you advice to what you should do because if it was something bad then that would not be good . So really it is best to just ask someone for their opinion. Because it is always better to do something when someone tells you that it is okay then always doing things by yourself and end up ruining something. So real question here is would you ever ask for someone else opinion? ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
885CBDD4A297,"Have you ever asked somebody for their opinion so you can make a choice? Most people ask more than one person and if you're one of those people that's a good thing. Asking only one person for an opinion is not really a bad thing, but that person you're asking might not tell you everything you need to know. Looking for multiple opinions rather than one is better because some people know more then others and you get more information to base your choice off of.

When you're asking somebody for their opinion it's better to ask multiple people because some know more then others. There are some people that will give you a basic four word response because they don't know anything about what you're asking them about. However others have more knowledge or experience. Those people will give you a long response to your question with more information and advice about the choice you're going to make. An example would be buying something and you didn't know if you are getting your money's worth. You could ask different people to see if you're getting a good deal or if you could buy something for the same quality for a lower price somewhere else.

Getting multiple opinions also gives you more information to base your choice off of. If you have more information it will make it easier for you to choose, or it will give you alot more options to choose from. You could put together all the information you got from asking multiple people to help make a better choice for yourself. This relates to me because it helped me pick out a dog when I was younger. It made it easier for me to choose a dog that would be perfect for my lifestyle.

Looking for multiple opinions rather than one is better because some people know more then others, you get more information to base your choice off of.

When found in a situation, many people ask others for their advice during the situation to very the outcome. If you ask more than one person for their advise or opinion on how to handle something, you will get multiple different answers. That should make the situation easier to handle, because you can see how it might end if you choose a certain way to deal with it. Someone you ask for advice from might have been in the same situation you are in, and can help you handle it. But you won't know if they have been in the same situation if you don't ask multiple people.

Asking multiple people for advice can, help you with a delimia, get you different opinions from different standpoints on a situation, and can make sure you are making a wise decision instead of an impulsive one.

DD1D41CC5388,"The other day I asked my mother for advice about boys. I think that I am coming-of-age, and I want to know how to get a guy's attention. I asked my mother, ""How can I get guys to notice me?"" My mother looked at me puzzled for a few minutes. Later, she responds with, ""Honey, all you have to do is flirt!"" Little did she know, flirting was not in my vocabulary. Soon after, my sister comes into the room, from eavesdropping, and says, ""That's not true, mom! You need to listen to me, sister. All you have to do is be yourself. If a guy doesn't like you for who you are, then they aren't worth your time."" All of a sudden my grandma, who hasn't been out on a date for a while, says, ""Darling, don't listen to them. What you have to do is act dumb. Guys will be chasing your tail if you do that."" Everyone started to bicker back and forth for a while. After gathering all of the advice I got, I started thinking,

""I know what to do!""

Personally, I think getting advice from more than one person has better outcomes. I think it's because with multiple opinions you have more options to choose from, someone may have trouble answering your question, and you may end up finding someone who has more knowledge about your question.

One reason people should seek for advice from more than one person is you have more options to choose from. When I asked my mom for advice, she gave me an answer I wasn't quite comfortable doing. Also, if it wasn't my sister and grandma, I would have been stuck flirting, which is uncomfortable for me. At the end of the day, I had a lot of opinions from different people, and it was my choice to choose the one I feel is better for me. If you don't feel comfortable with an answer, then ask someone else. Doing so, you may be able to get a different outcome. Also, the person you originally asked may have trouble giving you the right answer.

Another reason is the person you originally asked may have trouble giving you the right answer. When I asked my mom for help, she looked at me with a confused face and paused for a long time. I think it was because she never thought of me asking that question before. As a result, she couldn't think of an answer on the spot. She still gave me good advice, but it did seem as if she had trouble answering me. If you ever have someone who can't give you an answer easily, the best choice is to ask someone else. They may have the abilities to give you a well thought out answer. Lastly, another person may have more knowledge about the subject, so they may be able to help you more efficiently.

The last reason is someone may have more experience with the subject you are wanting help with. For example, my sister is in college, and she is taking a social development class. Believe it or not, she learned about the difficulties of confrontation with the opposite gender. In that class, she learned about what not to do when you are talking to a male or female. Which means she knows a lot more about my question then my grandma. My grandma hasn't been out on a date in forty-five years. As a result, she isn't the best person to give advice about talking to boys. In the end, if you want a good answer to a question you have, you should go to multiple people who can help you.

In conclusion, getting advice from more than one person has its rewards. My reasoning is because you have more options to choose from, one person may trouble answering your question, and another person may have more knowledge about your question. Ask someone who has more experience with what you want to know. Also, go to someone you trust, and someone who will give you factual information.

B2305853B773,"Often times it is hard to make decisions. Looking at all the options in different ways is an effective way to assess what the right choice is, but at times it's difficult to make those decisions alone. It's best to get the most advice possible, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. People's advisory can influence someone to make the best possible decision and recieving feedback from more than one person is critical to this process. When seeking advice, talking to more than one person helps you know what all the options are.

The best possible choice may not even be the one that benefits you the most. People tend to do things that benefit them the most instead of knowing how there decisions can affect others. When others give you advice, they are expressing their viewpoints. When making a deicision, people usually don't think how it might affect others, what is usually pondered is how they will be affected, but it's essentail that you know others viewpoints. In order to make a good decision, you need to know what the options are. When asking multiple people what their opinion is, they will give you an option. Asking multiple people for advice will give you a number of different options and knowing all the options will make it easier for you to make the right decision. Finding the best option that gives the most benefits without harming anyone will be easy to find because you can compare all the options given by your friends, family, teacher, etc. Asking a lot of people for advice will give you a variety of decisions to choose from, yet not everyone's advice can be equally considered as others. It's important to ask the right people for advice.

Some advisors may be more credible than others. It's good to get the opinions from multiple people, but it's also very important that you take in account the people you are asking. The advice from a friend will most likely not be as dependable as the advice from an adult. An adult will better proccess the information and are more matured than kids. In addition, one of the people that is giving you advice might be bias. This is why it's good to ask multiple people because one person may be giving you advice to somehow benefit them, or benefit something or someone they like. What if your mom said that if you didn't pass a class you would be grounded. You had a final test that determines your grade for the marking period. You didn't study enough for the test and your friends sees you studying during lunch. He asks you why you are studying and you explain to him that if you don't pass the test you will not have a passing grade and you will be grounded. You and your friend were going to have a sleepover that weekend. Your friend says to copy his answers on the test so you can pass. This example shows how credibility is very critical in the person that's giving you advice. The friend is biased and is giving you bad advice in order for you to have a sleepover with him, which he would benefit from. Having a lot of opinions that agrees with you gives you support.

People ask multiple people for advice because they need clarification. Even if someone thinks that they are doing the right thing, it's human nature to ask others what they think. Having someone else agree with you will strengthen your confidence and will make you certain that you are right. People will ask muliple people

""Is this the right thing to do?""

and ""You would do the same, right?"" to make sure that they know that what they are doing is correct. For these reasons, people get as many opinions as they can so they can make the best decision.

It's always best to ask multiple people for advice because it will help you know what all the options are, some people's advice may be more credible and better than others, some opinions may not be based on the situation, but may be because that person has a bias, etc. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Most people are not great at making difficult decisions, but recieving advice can help you analyze the situation and choose the best possible option. ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

2ACB43DD4A24,"Seeking advice from multiple people will give you a sense of what other people think about the topic. Seeking answers from multiple people will give you more of an understanding about what is going on and what you should decide to do in order to produce a better outcome for you and for others. In order to make the right decision you need to be aware of how the majority of the people you ask view the topic. Asking questions about problems is how you become smarter. If nobody were to ask questions, nobody would be smart, and we would all still be living in caves. In order to gain knowledge we need to understand how things function in our world. We need to know what to do and what not to do.

There are many possible outcomes that could lead to bad things if you don't ask others' point of view on the topic. For example, a classmate named Generic_Name and I are having problems between ourselves. I do not know whether to apologize or to let the freindship die off. I ask ten people in my class about their opinion on Generic_Name. Nine out of the ten people think that Generic_Name has a very self loathing and snippy personality. They also say that he often does not care about his friends and only does things that please himself.

Because I asked my fellow classmates, I now have a sense of Generic_Name's personality traits. The majority of my classmates did not like Generic_Name very much. Mrs. Generic_Name, my math teacher, often gets mad at Generic_Name and sends him home with misbehavior notes for his parents to read. I now know that Generic_Name is not a very nice person and is prone to getting into trouble. Based on what I have heard from others and what I have learned in class about Generic_Name, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be a wise decision to become friends with Generic_Name again. Becoming friends with Generic_Name would set me up for failure. I would fall under the influence of Generic_Name and most likely get myself into trouble.

Asking multiple people's opinions can also be a great stradegy for the work environment. Getting advice from others at work can lead to multiple benefits. For example, I am working on a presentation for a new product, I ask my bosses whether or not they think it would be a good idea to implement a free fifty day trial. Eighty percent of my bosses deem it necessary to include a free fifty day trial. In the longrun, it would help push the customers to buy our product becuase they know they can always return it before the fifty days is up. As a result, on the day that the product was released to the public, we made thirty percent more sales than we had previously thought due to the fifty day free trial. That very same day my boss decided to give me a fifteen percent pay raise for my idea of implementing the fifty day free trial.

In conclusion, you will always arrive at the best decision if you ask multiple people's opinions. The best way to understand how the world works is to ask questions. Without questions we would still be living in caves with no electricity and wearing no clothes. ""Two heads are always better than one"", said the great Albert Einstein. Asking multiple opinions will produce a better outcome than just using you're knowledge on the subject. There is only one way to put this, it is a complete mistake for someone to go into something blind, you need to know your surroundings, it just so happens that the only way to avoid going into something blind, is asking people their opinions.                                      ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Advice

When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

I think that people do this because, when someone is asking other people for advice, they are hearing different opinions on how to handle the situation.

Some people might do this so hear more than one side of a story or hear different ways to do something.

I do this to see what my choices are.

The more people I ask, the more choices I get.

I used to think that if I'd ask one person for advice, then that was it because I thought it was good advice.

Sometimes it works when you ask one person for advice, but you need to ask more than one person to get good advice because two heads are better than one.

The more people you ask the smarter or dumber some advice sounds.

Some of the reasons that people ask others for advice are, to narrow down their choices to pick the best one.

If they narrow their choices down to pick the best one, they have a couple to work with and will probably end up having good advice.

The first person you ask could have not great advice or didn't quite give you what you where looking for.

The people that you ask could have the same advice as you.

All of these are reasons to ask more than one person for their opinion.

The whole goal of asking other people opinions is to see which will most effectively work.

I understand the fact that the first person's advice is good but, you need to ask other people to see if it is good advice or bad.

Some people that give out really good advice are your parents or grandparents.

They have usually gone through what you are going through and know the right type of advice to give out. Teachers and counselors also give out good advice towards school.

Therapists almost always have good advice because they are paid too.

If you are going to ask more than one person for advice, make sure they are someone you can trust.

I believe that it is smart ask more than one person for their advice because you could hear one that they have not heard before.

If it is advice you have not heard before, then it could let you have a wider collection.

Some people might have the same advice or opinions therefore making it the most effective because it is the most common and used by most people. For me, the two most reliable people for good advice is my parents.

The best choice you can make from others advice should benefit you.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
5B57A518AE8B,"How does someone make a better choice when seeking multiple opinions from others?

Have you ever hesitated about a decision and asked others what they believe you should choose? When you ask someone about what choice you should make they often share their experiences on that topic giving you more knowledge on each choice. Talking to more than one person can help someone make better decisions by knowing other peoples experiences. Being aware of the possible outcomes, knowing what the experience is like, and knowing how it will affect others are all reasons why it is important to know other people's experiences when asking for their opinion.

When a person seeks advice from multiple people that have had experiences with their choice, the person is more likely to be more aware of what the possible outcomes are. For example, when I was choosing my electives for eighth grade, I couldn't decide whether to retake Algebra I or take Geometry. Therefore, I asked my sister, Generic_Name, who had retaken Algebra I, and my brother, Generic_Name, who had taken Geometry. Generic_Name's opinion was that because my grade Algebra 1 in was not good, it'd be wiser to retake it because the eighth grade Algebra I teachers taught better than the seventh grade teachers. She also mentioned that retaking it was a chance to get my grades higher. Generic_Name, however, told me that Geometry was easy and it could give me more high school credits. I chose to retake Algebra I, as a result, I have a perfect score in the class and I was able to learn more than I did in seventh grade. My peers that have taken Geometry say that the class is hard and they don't have a good grade in it. When I asked my siblings what it was like taking each class in eighth grade, they shared with me their experiences which lead me to make right choice by taking Algebra I which had a better outcome.

When people share their experiences with another person, that person knows that they could expirience the same thing. For example, when buying a product a person will want to know if it is worth the money. The person will most likely go to the reviews of the product and see how other described the quality. Reading the reviews helps someone decide whether they should buy the product based on how well it works and lasts. Another scenario is when people want to travel and don't know if the place they are traveling to is going to be how they think it is. People often go to friends or family that they know have traveled to that destination to know what they should expect when they arrive. Another time when somone will want to know other peoples experiences is when they want to eat at a restaurant. People will ask others for reccomendations for restaurants that they beleive they would enjoy and which restaurants they don't reccomend eating at. Some restaurants have unsanitary foods or have foods that can cause severe allergic reactions, to stay safe people want to learn from other peoples experiences to learn if they had any problems with certain restaurants so they know which places they should eat at. Knowing other people's experiences with things someone wants to try out is important so they know what they could be experiencing when they make a certain choice.

Sometimes making a decision affects not just one person, but multiple people. An example would be when a leader is making a rule they're going to want to know what happened when other countries tried to enforce the same rule. They want to know how the rule affected the citizens of other countries to know if the new rule would be beneficial or harmful for their people. Another time when this happens is when family or friends want to do an activity, they communicate with each other and share which activities they have done in the past that they think everyone else will enjoy. During sports games the players on a team will strategize with each other to find the best way to win. They know which tactics work and which don't after trying out new strategies each game and seeing if strategies that other teams used have worked. Sometimes making a decision doesn't depend on one person, it depends on multiple people to end up with a choice together so everyone is in agreement and everything is fair. These are all reasons why it is important to know others people's experiences and opinions when making a choice.

When a person is asked about their opinion on a certain choice they often share their experiences with it which helps the person asking make a better choice. Asking for others opinions helps the person be more aware of the possible outcomes, know what the experience will be like, and know how it will affect others. Making huge decisions is hard, but when a person makes them alone without anybody elses opinion, it is even harder.        ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

Generic_Name tells his mom in a monotone voice, ""Mom the veterinarian said that Generic_Name only has three days to live.""

Generic_Name get's back on the phone with his dad he says, ""They said only twenty percent,"" Generic_Name's dad says ""What the heck, let her try to fight it out."" When asking people for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person, because they have a difficult choice to make, they need a new prospective, and they are bad decision makers.

A lot of time's people have a really hard decision to make and need people's advice. This is something millions of people experience every day. An example of this is when us eighth graders had to make choices about what we did or didn't want to have in our schedules, when picking out our schedules. I'm sure that we all got advice via teachers, parents, or older sibling, we all had tough decisions to make that would effect our future. Know think of Spiderman Homecoming, a movie that came out a few years ago. Peter Parker, aka Spiderman, had the decision at the end of the movie to become an Avenger, but Peter Parker learning from his experiences and what others told him decided that they are right and he is to young to become an Avenger, so Peter politely declined. Know you might say what if the people helping you make these tough decisions tell you to do something stupid? What is say to that is that you just have to have some common sense so that stupid people don't ruin your life and use the advice of other people.

Most people only think one way and have a hard time finding another solution, because they can only think of their solution, that is why it is important to get other people's prospective. As you are playing soccer with your buddy's one of your friend's pull's a muscle and you incest that you call an ambulance. Your other friend's are not thinking like you, and tell him to rest and drink water because its not that serious. In that incest you would have wasted a tone of money and wasted an ambulances time by making it come checkout your friend, that would have happened if you didn't have your other friend's who had a different prospective then you. Know by now you have probably watched Avenger's Endgame and in that movie everyone had a different prospective. Ironman had moved on and Captain America had joined a group to talk about the people they missed, but everything changed when Antman returned and had a different prospective and had the idea to build a time machine. Know you might say what if every one in your group thinks like you and has the same prospective. What I say to that is that is impossible and even if it happened then go find someone, somewhere else who thinks differently.

People can be bad at lot's of things and one of those things is making decisions. In the episode ""Hurricane"" of the show American Dad, Stan, the dad of the family, makes bad decision after bad decision making things worse and worse. Stan makes his family stay in there house during a hurricane and then the streets flood, later Stan let's a shark into the house and even make's worse decision's later in the episode. So as you can tell Stan isn't the best decision maker and need's other people's advice. A lot of the time professional athletes make bad decisions and one of the most recent athletes to do this was Antonio Brown. He had a great job and was probably the best receiver in the NFL at the time, and then he lost it because he started making bad decisions, such as recording private locker room meeting's and tweeting very disrespectful thing's. These bad decisions ruined his career and if he just talked to someone and talked it through he might have gotten some sense knocked into him.

Two month's have past since the veterinarian said that Generic_Name only had three day's to live and she is still alive. ""Hello Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name's friendly neighbor say's as Generic_Name exits his apartment to go walk his dog. Generic_Name respond's happily, ""Hi how's your day been,"" Generic_Name waiting joyfully for a response. ""It's been just fine thanks for asking Generic_Name,"" Generic_Name's neighbor say's as Generic_Name say's his goodbyes so he can go enjoy this wonderful day with his lovely dog that is still alive thanks to the advice he got from the people around him. When asking people for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person, because they have a difficult choice to make, they need a new prospective, and they are bad decision makers.                ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

dvice is something humans seek for most of their lives, and mostly because we need it a lot since us we are not perfect. We should be able to get advice from different types of people like have diversity and know the opinion of others about certain situations, or problems we have in our daily life. Seeking for multiple opinions can have a very positive effect on the people who need the advice, and honestly I do seek different perspectives all the time. There's many reasons why multiple opinions can help us in our lives to make a decision we are not exactly sure about. People usually seek for multiple opinions to get the specific answer they want but don't know if it's right, some of the people they ask advice are not so good at giving it, and sometimes they don't think they have enough information or advice. All these are reasons why people seek for more advice in more than just one person, and i'll explain why some of them can be so positive.

Most times when people look for a different opinion from the past one they got is because they're seeking a specific answer they want. When we are in a situation where we have no idea what to do,but deep down kind of know,we ask someone about their opinion on the subject and when we don't get the answer we were expecting we lose interest on knowing the rest of what they think and look somewhere else to get that answer that we want, but are not sure about. I'm one of these people to be honest because sometimes I know the answer to what I want to do about the situation I'm in, but think is wrong, so I go around asking my friends about what they think, and when most of them don't give me the answer I want or the reassurance I need about my decision I stop listening and look for another point of view that thinks the same way as I do. Unless you have experienced this you might not understand it, but sometimes people just want reassurance about what they think is the right choice, but don't want to share it because they think is wrong, so they just ask other people what they think so they can be sure the choice they make is positive. There's so many people who think alike and share the same thoughts as others, so they help each other, and looking for those extra opinions lets them find these people who they can connect with and be free to express what they think with them.

There's people who don't give the best advice out there and don't care about others, so us humans look for another person for a piece of advice. In my experience I've noticed there is many people who won't care if you ask for their advice and that's why we are required to look somewhere else. Being able to ask more people for their advice or opinion is very helpful because sometimes when the person we look up to the most to get the advice from isn't there to give it, we can go to all these other people who can help us, and give us the advice we need. When we don't get the best advice from people we also tend to go to someone else for help because the person who gave us the last advice wasn't as interested to help you, or they didn't know what to tell you. Also when we don't get the type of attention we want from someone we usually think they're not interested in us so we leave and ask somebody else, and that's when we get the good advice we were looking for and don't need more opinions or advice.

The last reason why we seek multiple people for advice or opinions is because we don't get enough information or advice from the first person we ask, so we look for more,and more. When I'm stressed about making a decision I usually ask my friends or my mom for advice, and when my friend or mom gives me the right advice, but I think I need a little bit more because we didn't talk about it much and I'm a little insecure I ask someone else so we can talk about it. People say to keep things to yourself and I mean they're right because who wants everyone all up on their business but sometimes we do need the people we trust and ask them for the advice or opinion we need and when one is not enough we go to another to get the right amount we want or need to be satisfact with ourselves. Having multiple people to talk to also gives us the opportunity to get the right amount of advice we would like. Getting enough information about the choice we will make is really important and being able to talk to more than just one person will let you get more of the information you're looking for.

These are three of the many reasons why having multiple people to get advice and opinions from is important and can have a positive effect on people. We don't always need a multiple opinions and advice, but there is times when we will need them, and it will be helpful. Everyone should help each other when we need their help because when they need it we should be able to be there for them, too. We all make mistakes and sometimes we need advice from each other to know what to do, but if people need our help we don't need to wait for something in exchange of our advice because we're all humans and need each other to be better each day. In conclusion we all need multiple opinions and advice from different people sometimes, and it could have have a positive effect on our lives, and that's why these resasons make many of us seek for those multiple advices and opinions everyday.                                         ",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
F43C812A0073,"When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to several people for different opinions. Asking for advice from different people and getting different opinions is helpful because you get different points of view on what you are asking, it may help you make a unique decision, and to reassure what you may have been thinking to begin with.

Firstly getting different points of view on what you are asking can help you because you are hearing all these different peoples answers which may make you change your mind. It may change your point of view on the way you was thinking about what you were asking for. Gives the person multiple different answers and opinions to chose from so that you can make the right choice.

Additionally reassurance is always good when asking others for advice. Reassuring may help you find someone who was thinking the same thing which is good for making decisions. Seeing if what you were thinking is relating to what others are thinking so that you can make a decision that is not crazy and does not make since. Making confident decisions is good so that you are not second guessing it and changing your mind about your decision.

Furthermore unique decision making is always helpful. Unique decisions stand out from what others may be thinking. When asking others for advice you have the ability to make your decisions the opposite of what most others are thinking so that your decision is different than all the other decisions. Showing creativity in your decision is very unique because you put all of your creative thoughts in one decision which always makes it better.

In conclusion talking to different people for there opinions can make a creative decision, give you different points of view on what you were thinking for a better decision, and gives you reassurance. All these help make better choices for your decision making, and asking others for there advice can always help with yours. So that you always are making the better and right decision.        ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
0D1493FDAAD3,"Have you ever been faced with a tough decision and not know what to do? What influenced your decision that you made the most? The answer to that question is most likely other peoplesÃÂ´ opinions. Asking them to share their experiences with the problem gave you knowledge to help you know what to do. You might not think much of them, but peoplesÃÂ´ opinions help us avoid mistakes.

Making a tough decision is much easier when there are people to tell you what mistakes they made. When you know about what they did wrong, it can help you avoid it. Say that you do not know which product to buy. Your friends all say that one product is better, because their product broke and is unusable after a short period of time. Making the decision about what to buy is no longer difficult, because you have the advice of people faced with the same decision, and when you heard about their mistake you avoided it. By asking your peers, you made a good decision.

Another reason to talk to multiple people when making a purchase is to learn from their successes. ÃÅf you saw a group of people successfully do what you are trying now, learn what they did to overcome the obstacle. If it worked for them, it will probably work for you. In the scenario above, would it make it even easier to decide if a friend said that when he bought the second product, it worked fine and he was happy with it? You would probably would have no more doubts about your once tough decision.

When asking opinions about what to do in your problem, asking multiple people can help confirm if information about your issue is true. When searching for answers, you will find false information. But if you ask multiple people, false information will be rooted out and replaced with genuine, helpful facts that will make your decision easier. Once, I was writing an editorial about the trustworthiness of online reviews, and discovered that most of them are fake. When I was finished with the editorial, my main message coming out of it was that a word of mouth recommendation is one of the most reliable sources of information. Asking multiple people about your issue will get rid of any doubts you had about your decision.

Now that you know about how multiple opinions are a valuable source of information. When asking your peers, you will find out about what mistakes were made by them, and how to avoid them. If you talk to people about how they succeeded in your position, you will know how do succeed, and you will. Asking multiple people for a word of mouth recommendation will get rid of all the fake information, and make sure you make the correct decision. Asking multiple people is the best way to avoid making the wrong decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
4918D9A545C5,"Did you know that eight out of ten people ask for help and get the right answer. Also did you know that over half of students in the world do not ask for help, therefore, they do bad in school. Today my friend and I were arguing about if its better to ask for other peopleÃÂ´s opinions or not, and he said itÃÂ´s not because asking other people for their opinions is just a waste of time. Therefore, I wrote this essay to prove him wrong. Seeking for multiple opinions can help make a better choice because it helps you think of two sides of the story, other people are smarter and more experienced, and you can tell them why they were wrong.

To begin with, it helps you see multiple sides of an argument. It can help you understand why they think that way. You could change there opinion by telling them what they got wrong. Also could change your opinion on the topic. For an example, I was on a field trip and I went to a group of friends arguing about is it good to lie or not. I thought that it was obviously not good to lie. But when they asked there guardians they quickly changed my mind by saying its good to lie to not hurt someones feelings. This is one of the reasons why I think its good to ask for other peopleÃÂ´s opinion.

Also, the person you ask for help can be smarter than you. They can be more experienced and know more about something than you do. For an example, I thought you could use your hands in soccer but I asked my brother who plays soccer and he told me that you can not use your hands. Also they can be stronger than you and they would know which weight to use if your just starting. This is one of my reasons why I think its good to ask for other peoples opinions.

In addition, you can tell them what they did wrong. Say if they are making a project on a volcano and they were saying that the lava was purple. I could tell them that its not purple and they could get a better grade. Also, along time ago when I was in fourth grade I was really good at social studies. we had this project on the presidents, therefore we had to group up, so I grouped up with my friend. But he was not the smartest, so I wrote what the presidents were famous for and he wrote the presidents in order. On the day the project was due he had put all the presidents in the wrong place luckily we had a test on it so I new all of them. Therefore I helped him glue them the right order. Then when she graded them we got an one hundred on the project. This is one of the last reasons why you should ask for other peoples opinions.

Finally, it is important to ask for other peoples opinions because if you do not ask or give people opinions they could be totally wrong on something without even knowing. They could also get bad grades because they did ask other people before the test. you cold also be in a life threatening a cation were you would need to know something but you did not ask for other peoples opinions. This is why I think getting multiple opinions is important.                   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
20498D2BFDBE,"The reason people seek mutiple advice, it can be different tips, some might seek other help, and may benefit you in certain ways for your personal life style.

FIrst taking tips frim other people may help you through out life and may help you learn a different style. For instance, when playing basketball you might have to take some tips from your coach. When on certain plays if your running the play and its not benfiting your team you can ask for a better way to make the play succesful. And may be a way you be able to become a pro at that style of coaching you have got taught.

Second another reason people talk to more than one person is cause you might learn a different way. For example like you might be asking visual person how to explain something and they can't cause they learn by someone showing, them how to do it and you learn by somebody telling you or explaining how to do that particular thing.

Or they might know have taken the course you took in high school or college or may be talented in that work of field, or sport, job etc.

Last but not least personal life style is very important for you at a young age to learn a little bit about the changes, you that he or she might go though and you may need to talk to your mom or dad about when it is the right time or bring it up if yall on that topic. Maybe be about how to find a good house and the connection to people that your parents know that help get an deal on your first car, furniture, clothes, bills, and other personal questions you might .

However the might be good reason and all but not all you will most people might know ho to do this teach they self and some of us are independent im not saying its bad to be dependent on some things but you don't people to use you get you in trouble or can get in some mess with the law. And it will mess yo up expesically if you do sports if you get to big league like the Nba, Nfl,Mlb,Fifa you can get suspended sued have to pay a fine if you do something may get in trouble for smoking or being in some drive by dont just hang around people that gonna miss lead you hang around the people that's gonna lead yo in the right way .

My Conclusion is that it is helpful for asking for different people opinion but don't get the wrong perspective on certain things like if he or she needs to know about there bidy changes then ask your parents, or if you want to know about a certain thing abiut the field you then ask a friend you can trust or a family member you can trust about that particular thing you want to do, or a coach about certain way sto get better at what your set your goal to get there and that my conclusion sincerely eric  ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
446DFCDAD7F4,"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Seeking more than one opinion can lead you to make better choices because of a multitude of reasons these are just three.

First and foremost there is usually more than one way to do one thing, if you ask for more than one opinion chances are that you will find the easiest way to accomplish your goal. Second you are most likely not the first one to face this problem so if you ask for multiple opinions you will most likely find some one who had this problem before you and they will have the answer then with multiple answers you can choose the best one from the bunch. The last reason is all about information if know one has the answer then they will at least have information to give if you have all the knowledge you need you will make the best answer.

My first reason is that there is more than one way to do just about anything so if you ask for multiple opinions than you may discover the easiest way.

I personally do not know every thing so when I have a question a ask multiple people. Now with that in mind I am also lazy so I like to take the easiest way out when I find all of the information that I need, I pick the easiest way so this way I do not have to do much if any work and I get the my question solved correctly. although most of my questions and problems stop with grandma who I have a lot of respect for. She is vary wise and old because she is so old she has gone through most of my problems and more.

Speaking of old, wise, and problems that's our next topic.

The second reason I have is that people before you have probably faced the problem you have know. So if you were to ask for more than one opinion from the people who have done this before you. Then you should get a collection of different answers so from that you just pick the best one. For example in the sixth grade I had to do a history project on an important time period the United States of America so i choose world war two. My only problem was I didn't know any details about the war so I went to the oldest person I knew my Grandma while we were talking about it some other old people overhead us talking (read eavesdropped on us) so I got there opinions as well. So because I got multiple opinions I got more information than i had origanily hoped for. I had so much information in fact that I didn't choose just one I took the best from all of them and made my own, and that brings us to our finial topic.

The last topic of the day is that when you get more opinions than just one you get more information to better choose your answer, because when you have more information you make better designs.

When I don't know a thing about what I am saying I tend to make pore decisions but when am knowledgeable I make good decisions.

A example of that is when i wanted to go swimming in a pond once i did not know there were leaches in there so when i went swimming i got a leach (I named him bill until I figured out he was a bad thing then I screamed for mom) it was not a good idea. two years later i was going to go swimming in another pond but then i remembered ""Oh wait what if this pond has leaches so I did my research no leaches it has snakes though I think I will just read a book instead.""

See when you have information you make good choices.

their is more than one way to do any thing if you ask around you will find the easiest way. your elders have done this before they usually have an answer for you so ask them in fact ask several of them. having information helps you make the best choice possible the best way to get information is to ask multiple sources and opinions. When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This why asking for multiple opinions is a great way to make the best decision possible.   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
37FED48BEDBD,"You are in a relationship with a boy named Generic_Name and everything is going well. You are also best friends with a girl named Generic_Name, who starts to become jelous becuase of how much time you are spending with Generic_Name, so she tells you to make choice him or me. now you have two choices to make eithier to stay with Generic_Name or go with Generic_Name you do not know what to do so you ask for advice from friends, family and neighbors and they tell you something diffrent but you are happy because now you have diffrent opptions to choose from than the ones you had in mind.

When people need advice they should talk to more than one person because they might get a better alterniative choice than what they had before, or they could see what their neighbors,friends and family would do in your situation, or they might give you great tips that you could you in the future.

The first reason people should get advice from more than one person is because you might get a better option than what they had mind, like for instance lets go back to the story ,and lets say the child was gonna tell her friend off by telling her that she was a loser and that she never liked her anyways or that she should cry herself a river and build herself a bridge and get over the fact that she spending most of her time with Generic_Name. But instead you sat her friend down and tell her that she did not mean to spend all her time with Generic_Name or you might even go out to lunch togather and talk about whatever was bothering you. Which would be a way better outcome than the first exsample.

The second reason people should get advice from more than one person is because it is better to hear what your neighbors, friends, and family would do in your situation because you might not agree with the first advice you get. For exsample lets say the child in the story asks her neighbor what she should do and they tell her to punch the girl now you may or may not agree with that but you always have your friends and family but maybe your friends tell you to leave Generic_Name your other friend and stay with Generic_Name but you do not like that choice either, so you go to your family and they tell you to do what you think is right so you think about it and you sit your friend down to talk.

the third and last reason you should get advice from more than one person is because someone might give you tips that you could use in the future. Like maybe your aunt has been through what you are going through and wants to give incouraging words like let your heart deside not your friends or you will know who is best for you. Or maybe your grandma tells you that if your friend can't be happy for you then she is not a good friend which you could use when you are older like if someone cant love you then they are not the one for you and that you will find the right person oneday maybe not right now.

Inconclusion getting more than one persons advice is best because we do not know everything and depending on only one persons advice can be quite unsettling at times so leaning on other people opioions can help a lot now we might not like what one person says but thats why we always have other peoples advice to usecso we should use all the advice that comes our way.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

1C554F1D9D75,"Most people find that when they are faced with a hard decision, they seek advice from their peers. But why do we do this? As humans we are natural team workers this means whenever we are come in contact with a problem, or choice we work together to figure out the best possible out come. I believe that this is a very good trait to have because when we have a choice to make we learn the different perspectives of your friends, peers and learn all the mistakes and choices not to make.

Learning different perspectives when making a decision is very beneficial to you. You can find out all of the pros and good outcomes like money, seeing new places or you could learn all the cons like spending less time with family and loved ones, or being stressed out. I believe it knowing different perspectives and views becomes very useful and helpful when making sure that your choice will ultimately lead you to happiness. However you still need to be educated on all the ways to keep out of trouble and in check by learning all the mistakes and errors you can make when making a choice.

In the process of making a decision discovering all the areas where mistakes and errors can be made is imperative. learning how to go over every small detail could play a big part in your final decision like going over how much free time you will have, if you wont be dumped with work constantly. Learning how to handle situations with communication and problem solving skills will help you indefinitely when coming to a conclusion. Listening to other peoples mistakes also helps you decide when to actually confirm and make your choice because some people wait to long or they make their decision to fast and it ends up not working out in their favor. this also another reason why I strongly believe that taking advice from your peers when making a decision is a very important part of the process.

The decision making process while being extremely difficult is very important you make decisions everyday of your life like what your going to eat, what you are going to wear but some of your decisions might be more important. When it come to those big decisions, life changing decisions i believe that you should tackle those on your own but with your friends, family and experienced personnel. Taking advice helps change the way you think and sometimes chnages your whole mindset, in making a decision knowing every possible outcome and point of view could be the difference of your life being really awesome or it being misserable and depressing. Thats why I believe seeking advice is super beneficial when coming to a conclusion.   ",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
92933212F4D9,"Advice is when a person gives their honest opinion and feedback to someone, and what they would do if they were in that situation. Many people ask multiple people for advice because seeking multiple, different opinions helps you see the situation in a different perspective. Some people may have already experienced a similar situation to yours and could give you advice on what they did and how it resulted. Asking for advice from different people also give you a more variety of ways to approach the situation and how to handle the situation properly. If you don't ask anyone for advice, you would not have any knowledge on how to handle the situation correctly.

Asking for just one persons advice would also not let you grow as a better and stronger person. Asking for advice shows people that you are a person willing to learn new ways to make smart choices. Sometimes, it's good to learn things on your own, but in some situations, we might need help and advice on. Sharing advice with other people is also a good idea because you may have experienced something someone else hasn't, and you could help guide them into the right pathway by helping them make a smart decision. It's always important to give advice to others because they would be willing to give you good advice aswell.

For example, someone could ask a close friend or family member for parenting tips. Parenting can be challenging for some adults and maybe a little easier for others. Once an adult enters parenting, they most likely have absolutely no way on how to approach the pathway of having children. So, they could ask close friends or family members that already have children for specific advice. This allows the parent to learn more about how to properly take care of their child. Asking a friend or relative for parenting advice when they don't have any children, would not help the parent learn about how to properly take care of their child. They might ask multiple people for their advice about parenting, because it educates them different ways other ways parents raise and guide their child.

I remember I had a problem that had to do with school. At the beginning of this school year, I would put so much effort into my assignments. I did this because I wanted to prepare myself for high school and get into a good college. As the year slowly went by, I felt overwhelmed by the idea of transitioning into high school and all of the work I would have to do. I had the chance to hear some high schoolers talk about how they managed their school work and activites. They told me that even though school is important, it's always good to give yourself time to enjoy your youth and spend your time wisely. I've never recieved advice and feedback like this before because I've never thought about how fast time goes by and that I don't want to spend all my time and energy on school. I've now realized that school is a key priority, but self care is also a priority. This year I have made a lot of new friends and made many great memories. And I thank all high schoolers who have helped me realize life just isn't about school.

Giving someone advice can have such a big impact on them. Everyone eventually gets to a point in life where they just don't know what to do when a problem stands in their way. And many people are scared to ask others for advice because they might not want to share their problem but really need the help. You could ask multiple people for advice, and might follow one persons advice and not the others. And that is okay, because they're just giving their honest opinion about what they would specifically do if they were in your shoes.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
A6E992C5C8BC,"Do you ask more than one person for advice? When people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help them make a better decision. One person's opinion may not be very good, it would not help the person looking for advice make a better choice. Seeking multiple opinions from different people would benefit the person that needs advice. The benefits would include: making a better decision, helping the person decide, and it would be smarter.

Advice from different people will help someone make a better decision. One person may tell someone bad advice, resulting in a bad decision. It is better to get many opinions from different people; it would help someone figure out the right thing to do. The opinion most people tell you, is most likely the best decision.

Multiple opinions would help someone decide what to do. The person asking for advice may get told one thing by someone, then one thing by another. Asking three or more people would help the person asking for advice; it would help them see which one is the best decision. People would most likely listen to the advice more people tell them.

Asking three or more people would be smarter, people sometimes tend to not make the smartest decisions, therefore, if two or more people tell you the same opinion, it is most likely the smartest decision. Not listening to anyone's opinions will not always be a bad thing, people may know what's good for themselves. People still make bad choices, thinking they're right; it is still best to ask for other people's opinions.

In conclusion, listening to multiple people's opinions when asking for advice has many benefits. Asking more than one person for advice will help someone make a good decision, it would help them decide easier, and it would be a smarter decision, aswell. When in need of advice, ask for many people's opinions for a better decision.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
37A2E6EA2337,"When people ask others for advice, they tend to talk to more than one person. To get more guidance from others that could possible lead them the right way. Seeking advice from other people can help because their advice can lead you in the right direction and there are challenges that we all go through in life.

Their advice can lead you in the right direction. Seeking God for help. Yes, I know most people don't believe in god and it is okay, but for those who do God makes things happen for a reason. He takes people out of your life and gives you advice even when you don't ask. You may not know when he does, but he does. Also, family knows best. Other than yourself, family should be the closest people to you and they know more about you then others. Their guidance can rub off on you. Lastly, friends. Lots of people go to friends about things that worry them or things they want to talk about. Friends can help you with experience that they or someone they know has went through. Even if you don't think so, all these people in your life always know what's best for you and are good people to go to when you need them.

There are challenges that we all go through in life. People with the same experience. You may not know or haven't asked, but some people that you are close with have probably gone through the same experience you have and can help you through whatever you are going through. Being comfortable with others. I feel as if that is a big key in seeking advice from others, you should be comfortable with them. Be able to trust them and tell them things without the fear of them telling someone else. Lastly obstacles. There isn't a day in life where we haven't all had an obstacle we had to face. No, I'm not talking about like playground obstacles I mean real life ones. Like challenges, bad experiences we've had to face. I would never want to got through a bad experience alone and would want to seek someone else for help. You may not think anyone can help you, but it's more than just a 3 step process.

However, I understand how others may not care, or don't give the right advice at times and make every experience you have about to them. That has happened to me many times. Yet, no one knows you better than you know yourself. It is scientifically proven that no one knows you better then you know yourself. About 65% of people go to others about their problems.

Getting advice from others is better though because their advice can lead you in the right direction and there are challenges we all go through in life.

D569BD3E20CD,"Good advice can be hard to find. People tend to ask a few members of their family or friends for advice. Why do they do that exactly? Well here is why.

Have you ever asked for advice from someone and then use the advice you got? It could be good, but It could also be bad. You could feel betrayed by the fact that someone trusted could've given you bad advice, but maybe they just couldn't relate to the situation you were in. That could lead you to the next question,"" Then why didn't they be honest about the fact that they didn't have the best advice you needed"". Well maybe, they just wanted to help because they care. Maybe they just want to grow a deeper connection between the two of you. Whatever the reason is, you shouldn't just seek important advice from one specific person unless you really trust them.

Well, if you shouldn't just ask one person for advice, then you should ask many right? Wrong! You can't just ask any random person about advice for your problems. You should always ask members of your family or your trusted friends. Maybe they won't always have the best advice for you which is why you can ask the next person. I myself am religious, so I often pray to the Lord. I find peace in the mind that way, so I then find my own advice. But no matter who it is you should always multiple people for advice because once you have, you decide on what is the best advice for you and hopefully it is the advice that works out in your favor. If it is the correct advice, the connection between you and that person is strong.

Asking a few people for advice is a great thing because friends and family are supposed to be there for you when you are in need. And when you get all the advice you need, don't be too hasty to make decisions. Instead, think it over because advice can determine friendships, relationships, tough decisions, and more. Think hard because there will probably be no turning back.   ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
2319365E6640,"Why does people intend to ask multiple people for an advice? Asking more than one person for an advice is usually better than asking one person, because asking one person does not have enough evidence than asking for more than one person. Some people ask multiple people to see which of the advice is said a lot more. That way, the people that ask, knows which advice is better to use and which advice is true.

One example of people asking multiple answer or advice is Steve Harvey from the show 'Family Feud'. The crew and Steve, go around the city and ask more than multiple people for their answer to a specific question. Steve usually says ""We ask 100 men or women"". That is Steve Harvey asking multiple people for an answer to one question. Why do you think Steve did that? Well he did that to see which answer is the most said and use it for the number one answer.

I usually ask more than one person for an answer to see which one of the answer is said the most. Some people might say, the answer is C and some people might say the answer is D. That is very confusing to me since there is 2 answers and the question only allow me to picked one. So what i did was, i asked 2-4 people and see which answer they said the most. What i got was 3 people picking the answer C and 1 person picking the answer D. In this case more people chose the answer C than D, so i picked the answer C.

Asking for more than one person is a good thing because it can help someone to make a better choice. Some people may be shy to ask multiple people, but sometimes it can make you get a better answer. Some people are made to help each other. Try asking and see if they answer, if they don't answer, then ask another person for an answer. Asking 1-3 people is not a bad thing, but asking a few more people is better so that you know which answer really is the best.

In conclusion, asking multiple people can help you make a better choice. Asking multiple people is also good for an advice. If you are a mean person and you need an advice on how to be a better person, than the best way is to ask more than one person on how to be a better person. Some people may not believe this is true because they haven't experience it in their life. Asking multiple people is the best way to get an answer to any question you may have.              ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
DF9961E08D51,"Getting advice from others helps you in many ways. Sometimes it may be hard to make decisions alone, and asking for other opinions is a good idea. Most of the time, the person you ask for advice from will be more responsible, have a clearer perspective, and may have even experienced the same problem as you. All in all, asking peers and adults for advice leads you to make a better choice than you would have if you hadn't asked for their opinions.

Asking friends for advice helps you gain a new perspective on your situation. Since other people aren't in in your shoes, they will be less biased when deciding what to do. I was once in a fight with my friend Generic_Name. I had told her a secret, and she was the only person I had told. When I found out that other people knew my secret, I was angry and decided to stop talking to Generic_Name completely. I assumed that she was to blame for telling others my secret. I missed having Generic_Name to talk to, but still couldn't believe she let out my secret. I decided to ask Generic_Name, a mutual friend of Generic_Name and I, for advice. After telling Generic_Name what had happened, she gave me her view on the situation. She told me that maybe someone had overheard me when I was telling Generic_Name my secret. I thought about it, and realized that this was likely what happened. I was being so stubborn and wasn't very open-minded about the situation because I had immediately assumed that Generic_Name had betrayed me. Generic_Name's advice was very helpful because she had a different perspective on what happened. The next day, I confirmed that Generic_Name's suspicions were true, and apologized to Generic_Name. If I hadn't asked Generic_Name for advice, I don't think I would have found out what really happened. An additional benefit of hearing the opinions of others is that they can help you make more responsible decisions.

It is important to ask adults for advice because they are more mature. Parents and elders can help you make smarter decisions that will help you for the future. A study done by Harvard University examined the brains of a 14-year old and a 40-year old. They discovered that the frontal lobe, which helps with decision making, was significantly more developed in the 40-year old than the teenager. They concluded that adults in general will think about the both the long- and short-term effects of the choice, while teenagers are likely to just make the more appealing decision for themselves in the present. For example, if asked to go out to a party, a teenager would say yes because they think that it will make them more popular. Now, if the teenager asked the adult if they could go to this party, the adult would take into account that the party would prevent the teenager from studying for an important test, and they would tell the teenager not to go. The adult's decision is much more practical for the future, while the teenager's decision will only benefit them for a short amount of time. Asking an adult for advice is also helpful because they may have been in the same situation as you before.

Adults are wiser and more experienced than kids. They have seen more issues and also have a better idea of how to solve them. One time, my cousin, Generic_Name, had to make a decision on whether or not he should join the school track team. He knew that it would be a fun experience, but also knew it would be very time-consuming. Generic_Name was also a member of both the soccer and football teams. He decided to ask his dad for advice since his dad had also been a high school athlete. His dad's advice helped Generic_Name with his decision. His dad told him that he had participated in three high school sports, and that he wished he hadn't. As a student, he struggled constantly and never had enough time to go to sports practice and finish his homework. Generic_Name's father also said that he only got about 5 hours of sleep each night. Generic_Name was glad that he had asked his dad for help. He decided not to do track after hearing his dad's advice. The previous experience of Generic_Name's dad helped Generic_Name to not make the same mistake. If Generic_Name hadn't sought out his dad's opinion, he would have struggled to do his schoolwork and would be tired during the school day. It is important to ask people for advice because most of them have already experienced many of the issues that you will go through.

When struggling to make a decision, hearing the advice of others is vital. Friends and family members can help you make smarter, more responsible decisions that will help you in the long-run. The reason that asking others is so beneficial is because they have a different perspective, are more mature, and have also been in more situations than you. The next time you have to make a choice, the best thing to do is to seek for the advice of others.",6,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

And you have to talk to more then just one person to be sure because if you don't you can waste you money just like that. And you always have to be positive when people give you advice even you know they aren't saying things right they are just trying to help you. It's always good to give your opinion on things because maybe they aren't sure if they wanna buy the item or not. If you care about a person your going to give your advice to a person because they are some how confused on something you can help them. Giving advice is a way to be nice because you wanna prevent from that person to buy that item if they buy it and it doesn't work they are just going to waste money on the item.

Also by giving advice you can prevent people from getting hurt like if a guy walks to a store and buys something and it doesn't work he is going to come back to the store and fight the guy the sold him the item and then they both go to jail from fighting. Also if a parent comes to her friends house her freind can give her advice how to cook something maybe she doesn't know but her friend does and she can give her advice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
EA9E0708DE17,"Do you ever seek strong advice and one person isn't giving you the advice you need? Asking more than one person is a good start. I believe it is a good idea to talk to more than one person because it can help you make a better choice in then end. Different peoples opinions can help build one strong one, different point of views are always good to hear and older more wiser people have been though lot's of stuff and it could be good to ask them too.

Asking for advice from many different people is the way to go. One person's advice could be pushing your in a bad direction thats why it's good to get multiple peoples thoughts. Different point of view are good on this topic because many some peoples advice can persuade you to make a bad opinion and if you get multiple peoples advice it can even it out and you can make a good opinion. Everyone has different views and it's good to see the whole picture.

Older's peoples advice is always a good choice to ask for because they have been though a lot and they have some good advice on what to say. Elders are much wiser than asking kids because they have already dealt with these sorts of things and you can trust them more than most people. Asking more than one Elder is what I would do because they are mostly right and have lot's of different views. Thats why asking many different Elders is good.

Different peoples opinions on advice can help build one big strong one. If you get the same advice from two different people and then you ask a 3rd person and they say the opposite of what the other people said, you would most likely pick the Advice that two people had said. Building a strong statement is key and if you get advice from many people that have done something like it, it will help make a good opinion. A strong opinion is the best opinion when it come to making choices and getting advice.

If you take advice from lot's of different people your outcome will be better than only asking one person. Using different points of views, using your elder's and even asking someone that you trust are all good ways to find some good advice. seeking more than one persons advice will help you make a much better choice. Advice is always something you need to hear thats why it is good idea to get multiple peoples advice.",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

When i have a problem i ask people for their opinion on what to do because some times i'm not sure what to do and, the best thing for me is asking multiple people for advise. I think its better to ask more than only one person for advise because it can help me make a better choice. But other people when they have a problem only ask one person they trust the most and don't ask more people because they are shy or, don't want to talk to other people about their problems.

Some times when i ask some one for advise they don't know what to tell me or, they don't give me good advise so i have to ask other people. After i hear everyone's advise i pick witch one i think is best and witch one will help me the most and, to help me make a better choice. Making a choice on what to do is hard but with the advise they give it's easier to think what i'm going to do. When i have multiple opinions it makes me do better choices because i have different opinions witch i can pick from.

Asking multiple people for their opinions will also make you sure that you choice will be the right one. You might be persuaded to change your opinion which could cause you to make the right decision. You can assure yourself that you are making the right decision because most of the people you asked had the same opinion or similar advice.

Asking multiple people for their advice will assure yourself that your choice is the right one. Only asking one person for their opinion might cause you to make the wrong choice, and asking multiple people will give you a higher chance to make the right decision. A couple weeks ago, my civics teacher gave our class a project that was due the next day, but I had a basketball game the same day which would end at 8:30pm. Since I didn't know what to do I asked my friend who told me to go to my basket ball game and try to finish the project at home. After she told me this I asked my civics teacher and a couple of other friends who advised me to skip my basket ball game so that I could finish the project without any stress. Since most of the people I asked advise from told me to skip my basket ball game which then made me feel like it was the right decision I did which caused me to finish my project without any stress. Other than assuring yourself that you are making the right decision, you could also change your opinion.

People's opinions could change your decision. Asking more than one person who has the opposite opinion than you might persuade you to change your own opinion. Yesterday I asked multiple friends of mine for advice on what sport I should do. I could either do soccer which is every day from 4-8pm, or golf which is on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays for 5-6:30pm.

I really wanted to play soccer, but most of my friends told me that I would be stressed since it's right after school and every day. They told me that golf would be less stressful and will give me time to finish schoolwork or have time to spend with friends and family. Because of this, I chose to play golf which caused me to feel less stressed and gave me free time to spend with family and friends. Seeking advice from more than one person will allow you to not feel confused.

You won't be confused on what decision you should make. Asking multiple people for advice will assure you that you are either making the wrong or right decision. A couple days ago I wasn't sure if I should go to the library to study for my science test during lunch, or study in civics class which is right before my science class. After asking multiple people for their advice, they all said that studying during lunch time in the library would be less stressful and not cause me to miss anything important in civics class. Since most of the people I asked told me to study during lunch time in the library, I went to study in the library and as a result I ended up getting an A on my science test. Therefore, asking multiple people for advice will help you feel less confused.

In conclusion, asking multiply people for their opinions will cause you to make a decision faster. Asking more than one person for advice will also cause you to feel assured that you are making the correct decision. Other people's opinions could also cause you to change your own opinion. You also won't be confused as to which decision to make after asking more than one person for advice. Therefore, asking more than one person for advice will cause you to make a quicker decision. ",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
69A0715FA8A5,"Have you ever made a decision that you later regretted because you did not seek alternate opinions? Often times decision making can be a difficult task, particularly when you have little knowledge on the topic. Whenever I wish to make an informed and well-made decision I will usually ask my friends and others that I respect for their opinions on the matter. By having several different views on the subject, it assists me in making the best choice that I can. Sometimes I will go with my original idea, but on several occasions I have been heavily influenced after hearing other stances on the topic, and changed my own opinion. Seeking multiple opinions when making a decision can be very beneficial because it helps you in being more informed on the topic, it helps different views to be brought to light that can sometimes come from past experiences, and who knows, you may even be able to receive assistance in executing your final decision.

When you listen to other peoples' opinions on a specific matter a lot of times you will learn more about that topic. By hearing what other people have to say, you will often times learn a reasoning behind the way that they feel. This reasoning can sometimes come from something you did not know about the subject at hand, and therefore helps you in making a more informed decision. Some choices are based off of what will benefit the most people, in which you will want to hear everyone's opinion and know what will help them the most. Other decisions are made solely based on facts. Research can be helpful on a fact-based decision, but sometimes first-hand knowledge is the best.

Many people can have different views on one topic depending on their past experiences with that subject. When you hear all of these different views, you will not only learn more about the possible outcomes of your decision, but you will also learn about what has influenced other people who may have made the same decision. Even those that have not experienced making that decision first-hand will often times have helpful advice on how to make your decision, possible outcomes of what you decide, and they may even help you by showing what they think of the matter and how they would react to the given situation. Multiple views on one topic can help bring even more ideas to light, as well as even more possible solutions. By having more opinions, you also develop more choices that can be discussed and evaluated.

Whenever you are making an important decision you will usually have to execute that final choice. This can be hard to do alone sometimes, but when you listen to other people and show them that their views and opinions matter they will often times wish to help you in return. Not only will you be able to make an informed decision with reasoning to back it up, but you will have people behind you to support your decision and help to make it a reality. Some choices require careful evaluation in order to truly decide whether or not the efforts put in will be worth the final product. When you have assistance in achieving that final goal, it becomes much easier to not become caught up in the challenges and obstacles along the path to success. In addition to this, you will also have someone to refer to for a new view anytime that a problem arises while executing your final decision.

In conclusion, seeking several different opinions and views can be very beneficial when making a decision. By seeing new views and reasoning, you are able to make a much more informed choice. When you are able to hear first-hand stories about past experiences on the same situation, it can positively influence your decision. Finally, by showing others that their voice can be heard and that it will matter, they will often times want to assist you in achieving your final goal and executing your end decision. Anytime that I wish to make a choice that will benefit everyone I will make sure that I seek multiple opinions so that I can make the best possible decision.",5,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
1405831818EE,"Some people don't know if it's the best decision to take others opinions. It might not be the best but it could be very helpful. If your'e not so sensitive when taking others opinions then you should do so. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a decent choice because they can move forwards with there own opinion, learn something new from somebody else opinion, and know the point people are trying to make.

People can move forward with their opinion by taking in someone else opinion and not always there own. Someone else opinion might be a little more humble than your own opinion. It might be best to listen to others opinion's. people can take in something new from other people opinions. They can hear the other person out and they might be saying something helpful that you didnt know. lastly they can teach you something that needed to be heard. People can understand the point people are trying to make. It can lead you to success, It can get you farther than where youre standing now. And it can be a life lesson.

A lot of people take opinions from their best friends, family members, or someone they are really close with. It might be very rare for someone to take an opinion from somebody they hardly know. Some people take opinions from friendly people if they have a good attitude and good body language. Most people are afraid that people will give them bad opinions but its not always like that. Some people just have to look up to the right people for the right opinions. Very little people will give you bad opinions to see you fail.

Some people have negative opinions and might comment on anything you say. Or they might give you negative opinions themselves. Those are the people you dont listen to. They will bring you down and lead you to failure. You have to just ignore all of that and not take all of the negativity in.

Not everybody have to follow everyone opinion its just to hear something other than your very own opinion. Taking in someones opinion can lead you to a better life and a good future.

A5C75E6F0811,"When asking for advice it is better to ask multiple people rather than one person. Asking more than person can help you because not all people have the same mind set. Sometimes if you only ask one person for advice they can give you something they think is right in that situation but it can turn out not the right advice that you needed. But if you ask multiple people like three or four and see what the common opinion is you can take the right advice. And people tend to ask more than one people because they dont want to be provided the wrong advice. And if you are provided the wrong advice you cloud lose trust.

It is better to ask more than one person for many reasons for example if you ask one of your friends if what you should wear to a party and they give you what they they think. And then you go and see every body there is wearing a different style than yours. But that could have been avoided if you had asked the advice of four friends and then they could have given you the style that they thought was worn. Another example is if you ask one of your friends what you should get as a snack and they give you a bag of chips and later on you dont like the chips. But if you would have asked multiple friends what a good snack was they would have probably recommended a better snack than the chips. Or if you ask if you think you should ask somebody out and they say yeah or if you ask some more friends and they dont think its that great in idea to ask that person out.

The advice from a group would most likely be better than by asking one of your friends. Because if you ask one person whats in style. Than can give you some advice and then you take their advice and you wear it and people dont like it. Or if you need advice on what you should do in a situation and you ask one of your close friends what they thin you should do and they give you the wrong advice you cloud wind up doing the wrong thing in that situation. And sometimes they can lead you into the wrong things would get you in trouble. Or you cloud be put in a situation that you dont know what is right and you take the wrong advice could have a bad reputation or it could lead to you losing people you were close to. And you cloud hurt somebody if you do take the wrong advice which could lead to getting shamed.

And that is why asking more than one person is better than asking one person and that person only. because no matter who you ask youre probably going to get multiple answers but you can compare and see who has common advice. you want to ask the group so you dont get embarrassed in front of people or eat something that you dont like that isnt very popular among people. Or something you dont enjoy doing that person thinks is fun but it is a popular opinion to people. But if you ask a hand full of close friends or even just people you can see the common advice people will give of what they think they would do in your situation and you can see that more people think something else is right rather than the one or two people who thin something else is right.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent

6D42E21D4A28,"Do you really want all of your choices to be influenced by the same person? In today's world, most people think they only have to ask one persons advice. People should seek for multiple opinions because it makes sure they aren't being controlled by only one person, it may give them different viewpoints they never would've considered, and it will give them more information about the topic that they never would've known.

More than one opinion will make sure they are not being influenced by only one person. If they are only asking for one persons advice, that person can take advantage of the situation and control them. For example, when I was in 5th grade, I would always go to the same person for advice. They would always tell me to do things I didn't want to do but nevertheless, I would always do whatever they suggested. In retrospect, I should've asked for more peoples opinions so that I could see that there were more paths to follow.

Multiple opinions may give them different viewpoints on a topic they might not have considered. If they only ask one person about everything, they will most likely follow that persons beliefs. They have to figure out for themselves what they think and not rely on others to make the tough decisions for them. For example, when I thought my friend had been spreading rumors about me, I wanted to confront her immediately. Before I disscused it with her, I asked multiple people if they knew anything and I'm glad that I did. They told me the allegations were false and I was extremely happy I didn't rush to conclusions and ended a friendship for no good reason.

More than one opinion will give them more information about the topic so that they can make a more educated choice. One person doesn't know everything. To make a full decision, you need to know all the facts. You wouldn't find everything out from one person. For example I had my heart set on a presidential candidate that I wanted to win. One day, the topic of the presidential election came up in conversation when I was discussing it with my friend. She told me other things about his platform that I did not support. I was happy that I talked to her about it because it showed me that I can't believe everything the media shows me.

People should seek for multiple opinions because it makes sure they aren't being influenced by only one person, it may give them different viewpoints they never would've considered, and it will give them more information about the topic they never would've known.

8AAA87E056FD,"Have you ever needed advice from someone? If so, you probably talked to multiple people before you went on with what you were going to do. Some of the many reasons people do this include getting different perspectives, see the other side of an issue, and get more information on the subject.

The biggest reason someone may ask another person for advice is because there are different perspectives that can go with a subject. You can talk to people you may not see eye to eye with and get insight on their differing opinion. This leads to good discussions with people on the topic you're trying to learn about through the information you're given.

With advice, you want to know the other side of something and if what you're going to do is right or wrong. You can develop potential arguments to strengthen your side and you can know everyone's views to go along with your subject. Based on what you learn from everyone, you could get the full circle of information on what you'd like to learn about.

Lastly, you get more advice as well from asking others for advice. You can learn from other's experience, and in the end learn from your own. You'll know what went wrong in what the person did and why you're getting that advice. Other people will also think one thing is more important than the other. You'll have an overall bigger decision to make in the end with who's advice you're going to follow and how you're going to do it.

7EEF498A0C92,"Everyone wants to the know the right choice. People usually look for another point of view to make make sure they are making the best choice possible. Seeking multiple opinions on a situation shows you another thought process than your own. When deciding on big things like collage or a wedding dress you want to be reassured your making the best choice possible. You'll never know if you made the best choice until you hear everyone's opinion. Almost 100% of the time somebody could have made a better choice than you and is willing to give input.

The first reason for asking for advice from more than one person is reassurance. Your brain always helps you choose the answer the inference is the best based on your past knowledge and your information on the subject. But no single person knows everything there is to know. Thats why we look to more than one point of view. No two people think the same exact way, because of that i'm always going to want to know what they think on said topic. Knowing how more than one person's train of thought works to get their answer helps me shift my thinking to assure that I have selected the best option possible.

Specifically, one example is deciding on a collage. When deciding on a collage you take advice from your guidance consular, parents, and collage representatives at fairs. Making such a big choice requires a lot of scouting and studying. When deciding on collages you look for a range of opinions to make the best choice according to the information you find. Your parents may have a different collage in mind for you than your teachers, thats when you use another point of view.

However, when consulting such a wide rage of views it may change your way of thought. If you were doing your homework and you asked what everyone else got and you got A, and they got D, it may lead to a learning experience that will become past knowledge. You may use that past knowledge sometime in the future and it will help you make a better choice than if you did not. However, you have learned a new skill that will help you in the future.

In conclusion, people ask more than one person for advice to make a better choice. They seek more than one persons advice because nobody has the same train of thought. Asking others for advice lets you see it from a whole new range of views. People seeking another thought process can help them make a better choice because you may think now that they've explained it to you that their option is a better option and helps you make the right choice.

E7CBE8FEFCDF,"When you go to seek advice sometimes only using advice from one person isnt always the best. So its better if you go to multiple people for advice because people see things differently and have different ideas and that can help you formulate your own advice.

Not everyone has the same idea and thats okay. Especially when your looking for advice. When you listen to others advice it can help you formulate your own advice. As the old saying goes ""Two heads are better than one"". So its better to have multiple friends to help you with advice rather than just one.

Another saying is ""Not everybody sees the light in the same way"". meaning not everyone sees things the same way. By using this to your advantage you can think about how your friends might see your problem you need advice for differently. Sometimes your friends might not have the smarts piece of advice to give you and thats okay just dont take there advice.

Once you take all your friends advice into account you can start to formulate your own advice by piecing all of your friends advice together. This can help you feel secure about the advice and to make sure it doesnt sound dumb. once you do that take your own advice and solve the problem your having. Then you will know how to solve a problem like that again multiple pieces of advice are helpful because they can help you formulate your own advice, see the advice from different angles, and get different ideas. once you master this you can help out your friends when they need advice.

19E9A735673D,"People ask for advice every day. Advice has a very big impact, especially for people who are young. People dont just only ask or talk to one person when seeking for advice, they ask multiple people. The more people that give you advice, the more successful you will become in life and if you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, multiple people can change your mind.

Getting advice from multiple people can help you in life. Every person has different beliefs and views to everything and it can be very helpful at times. Someones advice can stick with you throughout your entire life and help you when you are in a tough spot. There could also be some misleading advice. For example if someone gives a piece of advice that you truly believe has a negative outcome, do not use it.

If you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, someones advice can stop you from doing it. Some advice makes you rethink a situation and change the outcome. If you think a situation is bad and you ask someone advice, it can be very helpful. If you think someone is in a bad situation, you give them some advice too. If you give someone your advice they will be very thankful and might do the right thing.

In conclusion advice is beneficial. If someone gives you advice, you should cherish it. Advice can come from anyone, not just people you know. Advice goes a long way and it has a great impact on people. There is a also bad advice and you need to watch out for too.

Advice makes a person more successful and helps them not do negative actions towards themselves or others.                                                                                                        ",3,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
CC27DF7CB308,"We have all had to make a tough decision, and we have all gone to others for help when making that decision. This is nothing to be ashamed of because people are smart, and the more people thinking about what to do in a situation, the better the solution is. When someone is making a tough decision it is crucial that they talk to others before making a final decision. First of all, by talking to other people you might find that they have better solutions that you never thought of because you were too close minded. Secondly, having others agree with your decision can make you feel more confident in your choices. Lastly, sometimes simply by telling someone your decision you yourself can find things to improve on.

Talking to multiple people before making a decision can help you find other solutions that you never would have considered. For example, last summer I was deciding whether or not to apply to Generic_School. Currently, I was planning on not applying because I didn't believe I would stand a chance and I did not want to waste 100 of my parents dollars. This all changed when I asked my mom for her opinion. When I told her my plan she said to me, ""Well, you will never know if you can make into Generic_School it if you don't try."" This inspired me and made me realize that it is not a waste of money if I try my best and work hard. This is a prime example of how consulting others can open your eyes to make better decisions.

A second reason to ask multiple people for their opinion is because knowing that others agree with you on a choice you are making can make you feel more confident in that choice. After my mom changed my mind and convinced me to apply to Generic_School I continued to ask others if they thought I was making the right choice. Having others, such as my dad, brother, and close friend, agree with me made me even more confident that I was making the right choice.

The final reason why asking others about the decision you are making is the right thing to do is that telling someone your thought process to reach a decision may expose to you any flaws that can be fixed. Think back to a time when you were writing a paper. After working on it for a couple of hours you were sure you had worked out all of the mistakes. Then suddenly when you went to read it to someone you realized that there are so many grammar flaws that you just did not realize when writing the paper. I believe that it is the same with decisions. If someone simply tells someone else their decision they might realize something that they do not think is right and change their decision. By simply telling someone your decision you could save yourself from making a bad choice.

Talking to others before making a decision is the best thing you can do for yourself. Even though someone may think they are making the best decision it is always helpful to get other opinions because maybe someone else has a better idea. Having someone agree that you are making the right decision can help you feel more sure that you made the right decision. Even if neither of these things are the case, by telling someone your decision and the thought process behind it you may find a kink in the process that when worked out, can help you make a better decision. All of these reasons are why I am asking you to ask others for advice before making a decision, because you know what they say, two minds are better than one.",4,Seeking multiple opinions,Independent
